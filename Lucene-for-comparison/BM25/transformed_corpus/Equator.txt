 equator -  wikipediaan equator is the intersection of the surface of a rotating spheroid  such as a planet  with the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation and midway between its poles  on earth  the equator is an imaginary line on the surface  equidistant from the north and south poles  dividing the earth into northern and southern hemispheres  it is about 40,075  kilometres (24,901  mi  long  of which 78.7%  lies across water and 21.3%  over land the latitude of the earth s equator is  by definition  0°   zero degrees  of arc  the equator is one of the five notable circles of latitude on earth  the other four are the two polar circles  the arctic circle and the antarctic circle  and the two tropical circles  the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn   the equator is the only line of latitude which is also a great circle — that is  one whose plane passes through the center of the globe  the plane of earth s equator  when projected outwards to the celestial sphere  defines the celestial equator in the cycle of earth s seasons  the plane of the equator passes through the sun twice per year  at the march and september equinoxes  to an observer on the earth  the sun appears to travel north or south over the equator  or the celestial equator  at these times  light rays from the center of the sun are perpendicular to the surface of the earth at the point of solar noon on the equator locations on the equator experience the quickest sunrises and sunsets  because the sun moves nearly perpendicular to the horizon for most of the year  the length of daylight  sunrise to sunset  is almost constant throughout the year  it is about fourteen minutes longer than nighttime due to atmospheric refraction and the fact that sunrise is begun  or sunset is ended  as the upper edge  not the centre  of the sun s disk crosses the horizon the earth bulges slightly at the equator  the  average  diameter of the earth is 12,750  kilometres (7,922  mi   but the diameter at the equator is about 43  kilometres (27  mi  greater than at the near the equator  such as the guiana space centre in kourou  french guiana  are good locations for spaceports as they have a faster rotational speed than other latitudes  the added velocity reduces the fuel needed to launch spacecraft  because the earth spins to the east  spacecraft must also launch to the east  or to the southeast or northeast  to take advantage of this earth-boost  of needed the precise location of the equator is not truly fixed  the true equatorial plane is perpendicular to the earth s spin axis  which drifts about 9  metres (30  ft  during a year  this effect must be accounted for in detailed geophysical needed in two widely used geodetic standards  the equator is modelled as a circle whose radius is a whole number of metres  in 1976  the iau chose a radius of 6,378.140  kilometres (3,963.192  mi   codified as the iau-1976  value   later refined by the iugg to 6,378.137  kilometres (3,963.191  mi  and adopted in wgs-84.  despite this change  the yet more recent iau-2000  retained the old iau-1976  value  if it were really circular  the length of the equator would be exactly 2π  times the radius  namely 40,075.036  kilometres (24,901.473  mi   however  due to the effect of tidal force on the earth s surface the actual circumference at the equator is about 40,075.16  kilometres (24,901.55  mi  the geographical mile is defined as one arc minute of the equator  so it has different values depending on which radius is assumed  for example  by wsg-84,  the distance is 1,855.3248  metres (6,087.024  ft   while by iau-2000,  it is 1,855.3257  metres (6,087.027  ft   this is a difference of less than one millimeter over the total distance  approximately 1.86  kilometres (1.16  mi   the earth is commonly modeled as a sphere flattened 0.336%  along its axis  this makes the equator 0.16%  longer than a meridian  a great circle passing through the two poles   the iugg standard meridian is  to the nearest millimetre  40,007.862917  kilometres (24,859.733480  mi   one arc minute of which is 1,852.216  metres (6,076.82  ft   explaining the si standardization of the nautical mile as 1,852  metres (6,076  ft   more than 3  metres (9.8  ft  less than the geographical mile the sea-level  surface of the earth  the geoid  is irregular  so the actual length of the equator is not so easy to determine  aviation week and space technology on 9  october 1961  reported that measurements using the transit iv-a  satellite had shown the equatorial  diameter  from longitude 11°  west to 169°  east to be 1,000  feet (300  m  greater than its  diameter  ninety degrees needed certain navies  such as the royal navy  russian navy  and us navy  have a tradition of holding ceremonies aboard ships to mark sailors  first crossing of the equator  these rites of initiation have in the past been notorious for their needed  milder line-crossing  ceremonies  typically featuring king neptune  are also held for passengers  entertainment on some civilian ocean liners and cruise needed the equator traverses the land of 11  countries  starting at the prime meridian and heading eastwards  the equator passes through despite its name  no part of equatorial guinea s territory lies on the equator  however  its island of annobón is 155  km (96  mi  south of the equator  and the rest of the country lies to the north seasons result from the yearly revolution of the earth around the sun and the tilt of the earth s axis relative to the plane of revolution  during the year the northern and southern hemispheres are inclined toward or away from the sun according to earth s position in its orbit  the hemisphere inclined toward the sun receives more sunlight and is in summer  while the other hemisphere receives less sun and is in winter  see solstice  at the equinoxes  the earth s axis is not tilted toward the sun  instead it is perpendicular to the sun meaning that the day is about 12  hours long  as is the night  across the whole of the earth the equator lies mostly on the three largest oceans  the atlantic ocean  the indian ocean  and the pacific ocean  near the equator there is little temperature fluctuation throughout the year  though there may be dramatic differences in rainfall and humidity  the terms summer  autumn  winter and spring do not generally apply  lowlands around the equator generally have a tropical rainforest climate  also known as an equatorial climate  though cold currents cause some regions to have tropical monsoon climates with a dry season in the middle of the year  and the somali current generated by the asian monsoon due to continental heating via the high tibetan plateau causes greater somalia to have an arid climate despite its equatorial location average annual temperatures in equatorial lowlands are around 30  °c (86  °f  during the day and 23  °c (73  °f  at night  rainfall is away from cold current upwelling zones very high  from 2,500  to 3,500  mm (98  to 138  in  per year  average rainy days are around 200  per year and average annual sunshine hours around 2,000.  despite high year-round  sea level temperatures  some higher altitudes such as the andes and mount kilimanjaro sustain glaciers  the highest point on the equator is at the elevation of 4,690  metres (15,387  ft   at 0°0′0″n  77°59′31″w﻿    ﻿0.00000°n  77.99194°w﻿    0.00000;  -77.99194﻿   highest point on the equator   found on the southern slopes of volcán cayambe 5,790  metres (18,996  ft   in ecuador  this is slightly above the snow line and is the only place on the equator where snow lies on the ground  at the equator the snow line is around 1,000  metres (3,280  ft  lower than on mount everest and as much as 2,000  metres (6,560  ft  lower than the highest snow line in the world  near the tropic of capricorn on llullaillaco
