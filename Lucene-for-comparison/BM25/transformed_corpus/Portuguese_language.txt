mozambique  angola  and são tomé and it also has co-official  language status in east timor  equatorial guinea and macau in china  as the result of expansion during colonial times  a cultural presence of portuguese and portuguese creole speakers are also found in goa  daman and diu in in batticaloa on the east coast of sri lanka  in the indonesian island of flores  in the malacca region of malaysia  and the abc islands in the caribbean where papiamento is spoken  while cape verdean creole is the most widely spoken portuguese-based  creole  a portuguese-speaking  person or nation may be referred to as  lusophone  in both english and portuguese portuguese is part of the ibero-romance  group that evolved from several dialects of vulgar latin in the medieval kingdom of galicia  and has kept some celtic phonology and with approximately 215  to 220  million native speakers and 260  million total speakers  portuguese is usually listed as the sixth most natively spoken language in the world  the third-most  spoken european language in the world in terms of native and a major language of the southern hemisphere  it is also the most spoken language in south america and the second-most  spoken in latin america after spanish  and is an official language of the european union  mercosul  oas  ecowas and the african union when the romans arrived in the iberian peninsula in 216  b c   they brought the latin language with them  from which all romance languages descend  the language was spread by roman soldiers  settlers  and merchants  who built roman cities mostly near the settlements of previous celtic or celtiberian civilizations established long before the roman arrivals between 409  a d  and 711  a d   as the roman empire collapsed in western europe  the iberian peninsula was conquered by germanic peoples of the migration period  the occupiers  mainly and visigoths who originally spoke germanic languages  quickly adopted late roman culture and the vulgar latin dialects of the peninsula and over the next 300  years totally integrated into the local populations  after the moorish invasion beginning in 711,  arabic became the administrative and common language in the conquered regions  but most of the remaining christian population continued to speak a form of romance commonly known as mozarabic  which lasted three centuries longer in spain portuguese evolved from the medieval language  known today by linguists as galician-portuguese,  old portuguese or old galician  of the northwestern medieval kingdom of galicia  it is in latin administrative documents of the 9th  century that written galician-portuguese  words and phrases are first recorded  this phase is known as proto-portuguese,  which lasted from the 9th  century until the 12th-century  independence of the county of portugal from the kingdom of león  by then reigning over galicia in the first part of the galician-portuguese  period  from the 12th  to the 14th  century   the language was increasingly used for documents and other written forms  for some time  it was the language of preference for lyric poetry in christian hispania  much as occitan was the language of the poetry of the troubadours in france  portugal became an independent kingdom in 1139,  under king afonso i of portugal  in 1290,  king denis of portugal created the first portuguese university in lisbon  the estudos gerais  which later moved to coimbra  and decreed for portuguese  then simply called the  common language   to be known as the portuguese language and used officially in the second period of old portuguese  in the 15th  and 16th  centuries  with the portuguese discoveries  the language was taken to many regions of africa  asia  and the americas  by the mid-16th  century  portuguese had become a lingua franca in asia and africa  used not only for colonial administration and trade but also for communication between local officials and europeans of all nationalities its spread was helped by mixed marriages between portuguese and local people and by its association with roman catholic missionary efforts  which led to the formation of creole languages such as that called kristang in many parts of asia  from the word cristão   christian    the language continued to be popular in parts of asia until the 19th  century  some portuguese-speaking  christian communities in india  sri lanka  malaysia  and indonesia preserved their language even after they were isolated from portugal the end of the old portuguese period was marked by the publication of the cancioneiro geral by garcia de resende  in 1516.  the early times of modern portuguese  which spans the period from the 16th  century to the present day  were characterized by an increase in the number of learned words borrowed from classical latin and classical greek because of the renaissance  which greatly enriched the lexicon  most literate portuguese speakers were also literate in latin  and thus they easily adopted latin words into their writing—and eventually speech—in needed spanish author miguel de cervantes once called portuguese  the sweet and gracious language   while the brazilian poet olavo bilac described it as a última flor do lácio  inculta e bela   the last flower of latium  rustic and beautiful    portuguese is also termed  the language of camões   after luís vaz de camões  one of the greatest literary figures in the portuguese language and author of the portuguese epic poem os march 2006,  the museum of the portuguese language  an interactive museum about the portuguese language  was founded in são paulo  brazil  the city with the greatest number of portuguese language speakers in the the museum is the first of its kind in the in 2015  the museum was destroyed in a fire  but there are plans to reconstruct is the native anguage of the vast majority of people in and and 99.8%  of the population of são tomé and príncipe declared speaking portuguese in the 1991  needed  perhaps 75%  of the population of angola speaks and 85%  are more or less just over 40%   and rapidly increasing  of the population of mozambique are native speakers of portuguese  and 60%  are fluent  according to the 2007  portuguese is also spoken natively by 30%  of the population in guinea-bissau,  and a portuguese-based  creole is understood by no data is available for cape verde  but almost all the population is bilingual  and the monolingual population speaks cape verdean creole there are also significant portuguese speaking immigrant communities in many countries including andorra canada (400,275  people in the 2006  france (900,000  japan (400,000  namibia  about 4–5%  of the population  mainly refugees from angola in the north of the paraguay (10.7%  or 636,000  macau (0.6%  or 12,000  switzerland (196,000  nationals in venezuela and the united states (0.35%  of the population or 1,228,126  speakers according to the 2007  american community some parts of former portuguese india  namely and daman and the language is still spoken by about 10,000  people  in 2014,  an estimated 1,500  students were learning portuguese in community of portuguese language  in portuguese comunidade dos países de língua portuguesa  with the portuguese acronym cplp  consists of the eight independent countries that have portuguese as an official language  angola  brazil  cape verde  east timor  equatorial guinea  guinea-bissau,  mozambique  portugal and são tomé and guinea made a formal application for full membership to the cplp in june 2010,  a status given only to states with portuguese as an official in 2011,  portuguese became its third official language  besides spanish and and  in july 2014,  the country was accepted as a member of the is also one of the official languages of the special administrative region of the people s republic of china of macau  alongside chinese  and of several international organizations  including the the organization of ibero-american  the union of south american the organization of american the african the economic community of west african the southern african development and the european to the world factbook country population estimates for 2017,  the population of each of the ten jurisdictions is as follows  by descending order  this means that the population living in the lusophone official area is around 280,000,000  inhabitants  this number does not include the lusophone diaspora  estimated at approximately 10  million people  including 4.5  million portuguese  3  million brazilians  and half a million cape verdeans  among others   although it is hard to obtain official accurate numbers of diasporic portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of lusophone territory or are children of immigrants  and may have only a basic command of the language  it is also important to note that a large part of the diaspora is a part of the already-counted  population of the portuguese-speaking  countries and territories  such as the high number of brazilian and palop emigrant citizens in portugal or the high number of portuguese emigrant citizens in the palop and brazil the portuguese language therefore serves more than 250  million people daily  who have direct or indirect legal  juridical and social contact with it  varying from the only language used in any contact  to only education  contact with local or international administration  commerce and services or the simple sight of road signs  public information and advertising in portuguese portuguese is a mandatory subject in the school curriculum in and other countries where portuguese is taught at schools or is being introduced now include the republic of the and south to estimates by unesco  portuguese is the fastest-growing  european language after english and the language has  according to the newspaper the portugal news publishing data given from unesco  the highest potential for growth as an international language in southern africa and south portuguese is a globalized language spoken officially on five continents  and as a second language by millions worldwide since 1991,  when brazil signed into the economic community of mercosul with other south american nations  namely argentina  uruguay and paraguay  portuguese is either mandatory  or taught  in the schools of those south american countries although early in the 21st  century  after macau was ceded to china and brazilian immigration to japan slowed down  the use of portuguese was in decline in asia  it is once again becoming a language of opportunity there  mostly because of increased diplomatic and financial ties with economically powerful portuguese-speaking  countries  brazil  angola  mozambique  etc   in the is used for educated  formal and colloquial respectful speech in most portuguese-speaking  regions  in the brazilian state of rio grande do sul  você is virtually absent from the spoken language  in portugal  it may be considered disrespectful to treat a stranger as você  so the pronoun is either replaced by the name of the person  or a title  or it is omitted  since the verbal conjugation allows the distinction between formal and informal treatment  riograndense  or gaúcho  portuguese normally distinguishes formal from informal speech by verbal conjugation  informal speech employs tu followed by third person verbs  formal language retains the traditional second person conjugation of tu has three different forms in brazil  verb  to see   tu viste   in the traditional second person  tu viu   in the third person  and tu visse   in the innovative second person   the conjugation used in the brazilian states of pará  santa catarina and maranhão being generally traditional second person  the kind that is used in other portuguese-speaking  countries and learned in brazilian schools the predominance of southeastern-based  media products has established você as the pronoun of choice for the second person singular in both writing and multimedia communications  however  in the city of rio de janeiro  the country s main cultural centre  the usage of tu has been expanding ever since the end of the 20th  century a linguistic research on the topic in portuguese   being most frequent among youngsters and a number of studies have also shown an increase in its use in a number of other brazilian standard european portuguese  português padrão or português continental  is based on the portuguese spoken in the area including and surrounding the cities of coimbra and lisbon  in central portugal  standard european portuguese is also the preferred standard by the portuguese-speaking  african countries  as such  and despite the fact that its speakers are dispersed around the world  portuguese has only two dialects used for learning  the european and the brazilian  some aspects and sounds found in many dialects of brazil are exclusive to south america  and cannot be found in europe  however  the santomean portuguese in africa may be confused with a brazilian dialect by its phonology and prosody audio samples of some dialects and accents of portuguese are available there are some differences between the areas but these are the best approximations possible  ipa transcriptions refer to the names in local pronunciation differences between dialects are mostly of accent and vocabulary  but between the brazilian dialects and other dialects  especially in their most colloquial forms  there can also be some grammatical differences  the portuguese-based  creoles spoken in various parts of africa  asia  and the americas are independent languages portuguese  like catalan  preserved the stressed vowels of vulgar latin  which became diphthongs in most other romance languages  cf  port   cat   sard  pedra   fr  pierre  sp  piedra  it  pietra  ro  piatră  from lat  petra   stone    or port  fogo  cat  foc  sard  fogu  sp  fuego  it  fuoco  fr  feu  ro  foc  from lat  focus   fire    another characteristic of early portuguese was the loss of intervocalic l and n  sometimes followed by the merger of the two surrounding vowels  or by the insertion of an epenthetic vowel between them  cf  lat  salire   to jump    tenere   to hold    catena   chain    sp  salir  tener  cadena  port  sair  ter  cadeia  this characteristic happens today in celtic languages  such as irish and scottish the elided consonant was n  it often nasalized the preceding vowel  cf  lat  manum   hand    ranam   frog    bonum   good    port  mão  rãa  bõo  now mão  rã  bom   this process was the source of most of the language s distinctive nasal diphthongs  in particular  the latin endings -anem,  -anum  and -onem  became -ão  in most cases  cf  lat  canis   dog    germanus   brother    ratio   reason   with modern port  cão  irmão  razão  and their plurals -anes,  -anos,  -ones  normally became -ães,  -ãos,  -ões,  cf  cães  irmãos  razões  this nasalisation could be an ancient proto-celtic  characteristic which also exists today in breton and portuguese language is also the only romance language that has preserved the clitic case mesoclisis  cf  dar-te-ei   i ll give thee   amar-te-ei   i ll love you   contactá-los-ei   i ll contact them   it was also the only western romance language to retain the latin synthetic pluperfect tense  eu estivera  i had been   eu vivera  i had lived   vós vivêreis  you had romanian also has this tense  but uses the -s-  form most of the lexicon of portuguese is derived  directly or through other romance languages  from latin  nevertheless  because of its original celtiberian heritage and later the participation of portugal in the age of discovery  it has some gallaecian words and adopted loanwords from all over the world a number of portuguese words can still be traced to the pre-roman  inhabitants of portugal  which included the gallaeci  lusitanians  celtici and cynetes  most of these words derived from celtic and are very often shared with galician since both languages share a common origin in the medieval language of galician-portuguese.  a few of these words existed in latin as loanwords from a celtic source  often gaulish  altogether these are over 1,000  words  some verbs and toponymic names of towns  rivers  utensils and plants in the 5th  century  the iberian peninsula  the roman hispania  was conquered by the germanic suebi and visigoths  as they adopted the roman civilization and language  however  these people contributed with some 500  germanic words to the lexicon  many of these words are related to warfare—such as espora  spur   estaca  stake   and guerra  war   from gothic  spaúra   stakka  and  wirro  respectively  the germanic languages influence also exists in toponymic surnames and patronymic surnames borne by visigoth sovereigns and their descendants  and it dwells on placenames such has ermesinde  esposende and resende where sinde and sende are derived from the germanic  sinths   military expedition  and in the case of resende  the prefix re comes from germanic  reths   council   other examples of portuguese names  surnames and town names of germanic toponymic origin include henrique  henriques  vermoim  mandim  calquim  baguim  gemunde  guetim  sermonde and many more  are quite common mainly in the old suebi and later visigothic dominated regions  covering today s northern half of portugal and galicia between the 9th  and early 13th  centuries  portuguese acquired nearly 800  words from arabic by influence of moorish iberia  they are often recognizable by the initial arabic article a(l)-,  and include many common words such as aldeia  village  from الضيعة alḍai a  or from edictum rothari  aldii  alface  lettuce  from الخس alkhass  armazém  warehouse  from المخزن almakhzan  and azeite  olive oil  from الزيت azzait starting in the 15th  century  the portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from asian languages  for instance  catana  cutlass  from japanese katana and chá  tea  from chinese chá from the 16th  to the 19th  centuries  because of the role of portugal as intermediary in the atlantic slave trade  and the establishment of large portuguese colonies in angola  mozambique  and brazil  portuguese acquired several words of african and amerind origin  especially names for most of the animals and plants found in those territories  while those terms are mostly used in the former colonies  many became current in european portuguese as well  from kimbundu  for example  came kifumate   cafuné  head caress   brazil   kusula   caçula  youngest child   brazil   marimbondo  tropical wasp   brazil   and kubungula   bungular  to dance like a wizard   angola   from south america came batata  potato   from taino  ananás and abacaxi  from tupi–guarani naná and tupi ibá cati  respectively  two species of pineapple   and pipoca  popcorn  from tupi and tucano  toucan  from guarani tucan finally  it has received a steady influx of loanwords from other european languages  especially french and english  these are by far the most important languages when referring to loanwords  there are many examples such as  colchete crochê  bracket   crochet   paletó  jacket   batom  lipstick   and filé filete  steak   slice   rua  street  respectively  from french crochet  paletot  bâton  filet  rue  and bife  steak   futebol  revólver  stock estoque  folclore  from english beef  football  revolver  stock  folklore examples from other european languages  macarrão  pasta   piloto  pilot   carroça  carriage   and barraca  barrack   from italian maccherone  pilota  carrozza  and baracca  melena  hair lock   fiambre "wet-cured  ham   in portugal  in contrast with presunto "dry-cured  ham  from latin prae-exsuctus   dehydrated   or  canned ham   in brazil  in contrast with non-canned,  wet-cured  presunto cozido and dry-cured  presunto cru   and castelhano  castilian   from spanish melena  mane   fiambre and castellano before the last four decades  brazilians adopted a greater number of loanwords from japanese and other european languages  due to the historical immigration affecting their demographics   and they were and are also more willing to adopt foreign terms that come from globalization than the portuguese  while the degree of african  tupian and other amerindian lexicon in brazilian portuguese is shown to be surprisingly lesser than that commonly expected of the said variant by the local africanist and indianist academia  that also has to some degree influenced the common sense of what gives a different cultural identity of brazilians in relation to the portuguese   so that its lexicon is almost identical  about 99%)  to that of european portuguese settlers to colonial brazil were from northern and insular apart from some historically important illegal immigrants from elsewhere in europe  such as galicia  france and the it should be noted that brazil received more european immigrants in its colonial history than the united states  between 1500  and 1760,  700,000  europeans  overwhelmingly portuguese  settled in brazil  while 530,000  europeans settled in the united states for the same given belongs to the west iberian branch of the romance languages  and it has special ties with the following members of this group portuguese and other romance languages  namely french and italian  are not mutually intelligible  although they share considerable similarities in both vocabulary and grammar  portuguese speakers will usually need some formal study before attaining strong comprehension in those romance languages  and vice versa  however  portuguese and galician are mutually intelligible  given that portuguese has a larger phonemic inventory than spanish  portuguese is only moderately intelligible to some spanish speakers  despite the strong lexical and grammatical similarity (89%)  between the a form of code-switching,  has a more lively use and is more readily mentioned in popular culture in south america  said code-switching  is not to be confused with the portunhol spoken on the borders of brazil with uruguay  dialeto do pampa  and paraguay  dialeto dos brasiguaios   and of portugal with spain  barranquenho   that are portuguese dialects spoken natively by thousands of people  which have been heavily influenced by and spanish are the only ibero-romance  languages  and perhaps the only romance languages with such thriving inter-language  forms  in which visible and lively bilingual contact dialects and code-switching  have formed  in which functional bilingual communication is achieved through attempting an approximation to the target foreign language  known as  portunhol   without a learned acquisition process  but nevertheless facilitates communication  there is an emerging literature focused on such phenomena  including informal attempts of standardization of the linguistic continua and their closest relative of portuguese is galician  which is spoken in the autonomous community  region  of galicia  northwestern spain   the two were at one time a single language  known today as galician-portuguese,  but they have diverged especially in pronunciation and vocabulary due to the political separation of portugal from galicia  there is  however  still a linguistic continuity consisting of the variant of galician referred to as galego-português  baixo-limiao,  which is spoken in several galician villages between the municipalities of entrimo and lobios and the transborder region of the natural park of peneda-gerês/xurês.  it is  considered a rarity  a living vestige of the medieval language that ranged from cantabria to mondego as reported by unesco  due to the pressure of the spanish language on the standard official version of the galician language  the galician language was on the verge of according to the unesco philologist tapani salminen  the proximity to portuguese protects nevertheless  the core vocabulary and grammar of galician are still noticeably closer to portuguese than to those of spanish  in particular  like portuguese  it uses the future subjunctive  the personal infinitive  and the synthetic pluperfect  mutual intelligibility  estimated at 90%  by r  a  hall  jr   is excellent between galicians and northern portuguese  many linguists consider galician to be a co-dialect  of the portuguese language another member of the galician-portuguese  group  most commonly thought of as a galician dialect  is spoken in the eonavian region in a western strip in asturias and the westernmost parts of the provinces of león and zamora  along the frontier with galicia  between the eo and navia rivers  or more exactly eo and frexulfe rivers   it is called eonaviego or gallego-asturiano  by its speakers the fala language  known by its speakers as xalimés  mañegu  a fala de xálima and chapurráu and in portuguese as a fala de xálima  a fala da estremadura  o galego da estremadura  valego ou galaico-estremenho,  is another descendant of galician-portuguese,  spoken by a small number of people in the spanish towns of valverde del fresno  valverdi du fresnu   eljas  as ellas  and san martín de trevejo  sa martín de trevellu  in the autonomous community of extremadura  near the border with portugal there are a number of other places in spain in which the native language of the common people is a descendant of the galician-portuguese  group  such as la alamedilla  cedillo  cedilho   herrera de alcántara  ferreira d alcântara  and olivenza  olivença   but in these municipalities  what is spoken is actually portuguese  not disputed as such in the mainstream it should be noticed that the diversity of dialects of the portuguese language is known since the time of medieval portuguese-galician  language when it coexisted with the lusitanian-mozarabic  dialect  spoken in the south of portugal  the dialectal diversity becomes more evident in the work of fernão d oliveira  in the grammatica da lingoagem portuguesa  (1536),  where he remarks that the people of portuguese regions of beira  alentejo  estremadura  and entre douro e minho  all speak differently from each other  also contador d argote (1725)  distinguishes three main varieties of dialects  the local dialects  the dialects of time  and of profession  work jargon   of local dialects he highlights five main dialects  the dialect of estremadura  of entre-douro  e minho  of beira  of algarve and of trás-os-montes.  he also makes reference to the overseas dialects  the rustic dialects  the poetic dialect and that of the kingdom of portugal  ladinho  or lingoagem ladinha  was the name given to the pure portuguese language romance  without any mixture of aravia or gerigonça while the term língua vulgar was used to name the language before d  dinis decided to call it  portuguese the erudite version used and known as galician-portuguese   the language of the portuguese court  and all other portuguese dialects were spoken at the same time  in a historical perspective the portuguese language was never just one dialect  just like today there is a standard portuguese  actually two  among the several dialects of portuguese  in the past there was galician-portuguese  as the  standard   coexisting with other dialects portuguese has provided loanwords to many languages  such as indonesian  manado malay  malayalam  sri lankan tamil and sinhalese  malay  bengali  english  hindi  swahili  afrikaans  konkani  marathi  tetum  xitsonga  japanese  lanc-patuá   spoken in northern brazil   esan and sranan tongo  spoken in suriname   it left a strong influence on the língua brasílica  a tupi–guarani language  which was the most widely spoken in brazil until the 18th  century  and on the language spoken around sikka in flores island  indonesia  in nearby larantuka  portuguese is used for prayers in holy week rituals  the japanese–portuguese dictionary nippo jisho (1603)  was the first dictionary of japanese in a european language  a product of jesuit missionary activity in japan  building on the work of earlier portuguese missionaries  the dictionarium anamiticum  lusitanum et latinum  annamite–portuguese–latin dictionary  of alexandre de rhodes (1651)  introduced the modern orthography of vietnamese  which is based on the orthography of 17th-century  portuguese  the romanization of chinese was also influenced by the portuguese language  among others   particularly regarding chinese surnames  one example is mei  during 1583–88  italian jesuits michele ruggieri and matteo ricci created a portuguese–chinese dictionary—the first ever european–chinese instance  as portuguese merchants were presumably the first to introduce the sweet orange in europe  in several modern indo-european  languages the fruit has been named after them  some examples are albanian portokall  bulgarian портокал  portokal   greek πορτοκάλι  portokali   macedonian portokal  persian پرتقال  porteghal   and romanian related names can be found in other languages  such as arabic البرتقال  bourtouqal   georgian ფორთოხალი  p ort oxali   turkish portakal and amharic also  in southern italian dialects  e g  neapolitan   an orange is portogallo or purtuallo  literally   the  portuguese  one    in contrast to standard italian arancia beginning in the 16th  century  the extensive contacts between portuguese travelers and settlers  african and asian slaves  and local populations led to the appearance of many pidgins with varying amounts of portuguese influence  as each of these pidgins became the mother tongue of succeeding generations  they evolved into fully fledged creole languages  which remained in use in many parts of asia  africa and south america until the 18th  century  some portuguese-based  or portuguese-influenced  creoles are still spoken today  by over 3  million people worldwide  especially people of partial portuguese ancestry portuguese phonology is similar to those of languages such as french  especially that of quebec   the gallo-italic  languages  occitan  catalan and franco-provençal,  unlike that of spanish  which is similar to those of sardinian and the southern italian dialects  some would describe the phonology of portuguese as a blend of spanish  gallo-romance   e g  french  and the languages of northern italy  especially genoese   but with a deeper celtic is a maximum of 9  oral vowels  2  semivowels and 21  consonants  though some varieties of the language have fewer phonemes  there are also five nasal vowels  which some linguists regard as allophones of the oral vowels like catalan and german  portuguese uses vowel quality to contrast stressed syllables with unstressed syllables  isolated vowels tend to be raised  and in some cases centralized  when unstressed phonetic notesa notable aspect of the grammar of portuguese is the verb  morphologically  more verbal inflections from classical latin have been preserved by portuguese than by any other major romance language  the portuguese and spanish grammars are very close  it also has some innovations not found in other romance languages  except galician and the fala  portuguese is written with 26  letters of the latin script  making use of five diacritics to denote stress  vowel height  contraction  nasalization  and etymological assibilation  acute accent  circumflex  grave accent  tilde  and cedilla   the trema was also formerly used in brazilian portuguese  and can still be encountered in words derived from proper names in other languages  such as anhangüera and accented characters and digraphs are not counted as separate letters for collation purposes
