 ice storm -  wikipediaan ice storm is a type of winter storm characterized by freezing rain  also known as a glaze event or  in some parts of the united states  as a silver the u s  national weather service defines an ice storm as a storm which results in the accumulation of at least 0.25-inch  (6.4  mm  of ice on exposed from 1982  to 1994,  ice storms were more common than blizzards and averaged 16  per they are generally not violent storms but instead are commonly perceived as gentle rains occurring at temperatures just below freezing the formation of ice begins with a layer of above-freezing  air above a layer of sub-freezing  temperatures closer to the surface  frozen precipitation melts to rain while falling into the warm air layer  and then begins to refreeze in the cold layer below  if the precipitate refreezes while still in the air  it will land on the ground as sleet  alternatively  the liquid droplets can continue to fall without freezing  passing through the cold air just above the surface  this thin layer of air then cools the rain to a temperature below freezing (0  °c or 32  °f   however  the drops themselves do not freeze  a phenomenon called supercooling  or forming  supercooled drops    when the supercooled drops strike ground or anything else below 0  °c (32  °f   e g  power lines  tree branches  aircraft   a layer of ice accumulates as the cold water drips off  forming a slowly thickening film of ice  hence freezing meteorologists can predict when and where an ice storm will occur  some storms still occur with little or no in the united states  most ice storms are in the northeastern part of the country  but damaging storms have occurred farther south  an ice storm in february 1994  resulted in tremendous ice accumulation as far south as mississippi  and caused reported damage in nine states  more timber was damaged than that caused by hurricane camille  an ice storm in eastern washington in november 1996  directly followed heavy snowfall  the combined weight of the snow and 25  to 37  millimeters (0.98  to 1.46  in  of ice caused widespread damage and was considered the most severe ice storm in the spokane area since freezing rain from an ice storm covers everything with heavy  smooth glaze ice  in addition to hazardous driving or walking conditions  branches or even whole trees may break from the weight of ice  falling branches can block roads  tear down power and telephone lines  and cause other damage  even without falling trees and tree branches  the weight of the ice itself can easily snap power lines and also break and bring down power utility poles  even electricity pylons with steel frames  this can leave people without power for anywhere from several days to a month  according to most meteorologists  just one quarter of an inch of ice accumulation can add about 500  pounds (230  kg  of weight per line span  damage from ice storms is easily capable of shutting down entire metropolitan areas additionally  the loss of power during ice storms has indirectly caused numerous illnesses and deaths due to unintentional carbon monoxide  co  poisoning  at lower levels  co poisoning causes symptoms such as nausea  dizziness  fatigue  and headache  but high levels can cause unconsciousness  heart failure  and the relatively high incidence of co poisoning during ice storms occurs due to the use of alternative methods of heating and cooking during prolonged power outages  common after severe ice gas generators  charcoal and propane barbecues  and kerosene heaters contribute to co poisoning when they operate in confined co is produced when appliances burn fuel without enough oxygen such as basements and other indoor locations loss of electricity during ice storms can indirectly lead to hypothermia and even death from hypothermia  it can also lead to ruptured pipes due to water freezing inside the pipes an ice storm which struck northern idaho in january 1961  set a record for thickest recorded ice accumulation from a single storm in the united states  at 8  march 1991,  a major ice storm in the area of rochester  ny caused $375  million in damages  placing it among the worst natural disasters in new york state february 1994,  a severe ice storm caused over $1  billion in damage in the southern united states  primarily in mississippi  tennessee  and north american ice storm of 1998  occurred during january 5–9,  1998.  it was one of the most devastating and costly ice storms in north american history and potentially one of the most devastating ice storms in modern history  the storm caused massive power failures in several large cities on the east coast of the united states  the most affected area was extreme eastern ontario and southwestern quebec in canada  where over 3  million people were without power for up to a month and a half  whole trees snapped and electrical pylons were completely flattened under the weight of the accumulated northeastern united states was impacted by a major ice storm on december 11–12,  2008,  which left about 1.25  million homes and businesses without power  areas impacted with 3⁄4  to 1  in (19  to 25  mm  of ice accumulation included eastern new york in the albany area  central and western massachusetts  southern new hampshire  coastal and south-central  maine  pennsylvania in the pocono mountains region  northwestern connecticut  and southern vermont  southern new hampshire and northernmost massachusetts got hit the worst with the storm with ice accumulations ranging from 1.5  to 3  in (38  to 76  mm  of ice  this left residents unable to get supplies  go to work etc  due to blocked roads from trees that fell on the roads  any trees that fell quickly took down power poles  it took utility crews from 4  to as many as 16  days to get a look at the damage and start to restore power to nearly 1.3  million people  in all there were 675,000  residents in new hampshire without power and around 500,000  in northern needed in late january 2009  ice storms covered several u s  states  including arkansas and kentucky  most areas affected saw over 2  in (51  mm  of ice accumulation  and between 1–5  in (25–127  mm  of snow on top of the ice  this ice storm left well over 2  million people without power at its peak and killed 55  people  24  in rural water associations in arkansas and kentucky activated emergency response plans to deal with power loss to small water utilities across their states  neighboring state rural water associations  including experienced emergency responders from louisiana and florida  loaned equipment and manpower to assist the hardest-hit  the unusually severe winter of 2009–10  in great britain and ireland  heavy snow had fallen over much of the country in late december and early january  by the second week of january  many of the roads and pavements had been cleared by local councils due to the use of rock salt gritting  however  during the early hours of january 12,  a wet needed  moved across the country  causing freezing rain and heavy ice glaze  particularly in the south and west yorkshire areas of northern england  crucially  this rainfall had stopped before first light   when the local population prepared to set out for work and school  they saw from their windows what appeared to be clear roads and pavements but were in fact treacherous sheets of black ice  cars and buses almost immediately encounted extreme difficulty  and emergency services were called to dozens of accidents  pedestrians in the village of holmfirth found the only safe way to proceed was to crawl on all accident and emergency units at hospitals in the sheffield  rotherham  and barnsley areas found themselves inundated by people with broken bones  fractures  and sprains  and many schools were closed as it was judged unsafe for pupils to attempt to make their way there on december 25,  2010,  freezing rain fell on moscow and its vicinity  the glaze ice accumulation caused a number of accidents and power outages  of which the most serious was damage caused to two power lines feeding domodedovo airport  causing a complete blackout of the airport and express railway that connected it to the city  as a result  the airport was shut down and hundreds of passengers were stranded inside  with taxi drivers charging up to 10,000  rubles  usd 330)  for a one-hour  drive to the other city airports  sheremetyevo and vnukovo  where air traffic was re-routed  and amid heavy snowfall that followed ice rain  collapsed a day later  causing a full air transport collapse a tree covered in ice from the december 2008  northeastern united states ice storm a street in elora  ontario  canada
