 whirlwind -  wikipediaa whirlwind is a weather phenomenon in which a vortex of wind  a vertically oriented rotating column of air  forms due to instabilities and turbulence created by heating and flow  current  gradients  whirlwinds occur all over the world and in any season whirlwinds are subdivided into two main types  the great  or major  whirlwinds and the lesser  or minor  whirlwinds  the first category includes tornadoes  waterspouts  and landspouts  the range of atmospheric vortices constitute a continuum and are difficult to categorize definitively  some lesser whirlwinds may sometimes form in a similar manner to greater whirlwinds with related increase in intensity  these intermediate types include the gustnado and the fire whirl  other lesser whirlwinds include dust devils  as well as steam devils  snow devils  debris devils  leaf devils  and shear eddies such as the mountainado and eddy whirlwinds major whirlwinda major whirlwind  such as a tornado  is formed from supercell thunderstorms  the most powerful type of thunderstorm  or other powerful storms  when the storms start to spin  they react with other high altitude winds  causing a funnel to spin  a cloud forms over the funnel  making it visible minor whirlwind a minor whirlwind is created when local winds start to spin on the ground  this causes a funnel to form  the funnel moves over the ground  pushed by the winds that first formed it  the funnel picks up materials such as dust or snow as it moves over the ground  thus becoming visible major whirlwinds last longer because they are formed from very powerful winds  and it is hard  though not impossible  to interrupt them  minor whirlwinds are not as long-lived;  the winds that form them do not last long  and when a minor whirlwind encounters an obstruction  a building  a house  a tree  etc    its rotation is interrupted  as is the windflow into it  causing it to dissipate supercell thunderstorms  other powerful storms  and strong winds are seen with major whirlwinds  wind storms are commonly seen with minor whirlwinds  also  small  semi-powerful   wind blasts  may be seen before some minor whirlwinds  which can come from a wind storm  these wind blasts can start to rotate and form minor whirlwinds  winds from other small storms  such as rain storms and local thunderstorms  can cause minor whirlwinds to form  like major whirlwinds  these minor whirlwinds can also be dangerous at times eddies and vortices may form in any fluid  in water  a whirlpool is a similar phenomenon
