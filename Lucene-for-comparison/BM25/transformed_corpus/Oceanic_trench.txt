 oceanic trench -  wikipediaoceanic trenches are topographic depressions of the sea floor  relatively narrow in width  but very long  these oceanographic features are the deepest parts of the ocean floor  oceanic trenches are a distinctive morphological feature of convergent plate boundaries  along which lithospheric plates move towards each other at rates that vary from a few millimeters to over ten centimeters per year  a trench marks the position at which the flexed  subducting slab begins to descend beneath another lithospheric slab  trenches are generally parallel to a volcanic island arc  and about 200  km (120  mi  from a volcanic arc  oceanic trenches typically extend 3  to 4  km (1.9  to 2.5  mi  below the level of the surrounding oceanic floor  the greatest ocean depth measured is in the challenger deep of the mariana trench  at a depth of 11,034  m (36,201  ft  below sea level  oceanic lithosphere moves into trenches at a global rate of about 3  are about 50,000  km (31,000  mi  of convergent plate margins  mostly around the pacific ocean—the reason for the reference “pacific-type”  margin—but they are also in the eastern indian ocean  with relatively short convergent margin segments in the atlantic ocean and in the mediterranean sea  globally  there are over 50  major ocean trenches covering an area of 1.9  million km2  or about 0.5%  of the trenches that are partially infilled are known as  troughs  and sometimes they are completely buried and lack bathymetric expression  but the fundamental plate tectonics structures that these represent mean that the great name should also be applied here  this applies to the cascadia  makran  southern lesser antilles  and calabrian trenches  trenches along with volcanic arcs and zones of earthquakes that dip under the volcanic arc as deeply as 700  km (430  mi  are diagnostic of convergent plate boundaries and their deeper manifestations  subduction zones  trenches are related to but distinguished from continental collision zones  such as that between india and asia forming the himalaya   where continental crust enters a subduction zone  when buoyant continental crust enters a trench  subduction eventually stops and the area becomes a zone of continental collision  features analogous to trenches are associated with collisions zones  including sediment-filled  foredeeps  such as those the ganges river and tigris-euphrates  rivers flow along trenches were not clearly defined until the late 1940s  and 1950s.  the bathymetry of the ocean was of little interest until the late 19th  and early 20th  needed   when the transatlantic telegraph cables on the seafloor between the continents were first laid  the elongated bathymetric expression of trenches was not recognized until well into the 20th  century  the term “trench” does not appear in murray and hjort’s (1912)  classic oceanography book  instead they applied the term “deep“ for the deepest parts of the ocean  such as challenger deep  experiences from world war i battlefields emblazoned the concept of a trench as an elongate depression defining an important boundary  perhaps leading to the term “trench” being used to describe natural features in the early needed  the term was first used in a geologic context by scofield two years after the war ended to describe a structurally controlled depression in the rocky mountains  johnstone  in his 1923  textbook an introduction to oceanography  first used the term in its modern sense for any marked  elongate depression of the sea bottom during the 1920s  and 1930s,  felix andries vening meinesz developed a unique gravimeter that could measure gravity aboard a submarine and used it to measure gravity over trenches  his measurements revealed that trenches are sites of downwelling in the solid earth  the concept of downwelling at trenches was characterized by griggs in 1939  as the tectogene hypothesis  for which he developed an analogue model using a pair of rotating drums  world war ii in the pacific led to great improvements of bathymetry  particularly in the western pacific  and the linear nature of these deeps became clear  the rapid growth of deep sea research efforts  especially the widespread use of echosounders in the 1950s  and 1960s  confirmed the morphological utility of the term  important trenches were identified  sampled  and their greatest depths sonically plumbed  the early phase of trench exploration culminated in the 1960  descent of the bathyscaphe trieste  which set an unbeatable world record by diving to the bottom of the challenger deep  following robert s  dietz’ and harry hess’ articulation of the seafloor spreading hypothesis in the early 1960s  and the plate tectonic revolution in the late 1960s  the term “trench“ has been redefined with plate tectonic as well as bathymetric connotations trenches are centerpieces of the distinctive physiography of a convergent plate margin  transects across trenches yield asymmetric profiles  with relatively gentle (~5°)  outer  seaward  slopes and a steeper (~10–16°)  inner  landward  slopes  this asymmetry is due to the fact that the outer slope is defined by the top of the downgoing plate  which must bend as it starts its descent  the great thickness of the lithosphere requires that this bending be gentle  as the subducting plate approaches the trench  it first bends upwards to form the outer trench swell  then descends to form the outer trench slope  the outer trench slope is typically disrupted by a set of sub-parallel  normal faults that  staircase  the seafloor down to the trench  the plate boundary is defined by the trench axis itself  beneath the inner trench wall  the two plates slide past each other along the subduction decollement  the seafloor intersection of which defines the trench location  the overriding plate typically contains a volcanic arc and forearc region  the volcanic arc is caused by physical and chemical interactions between the subducted plate at depth and asthenospheric mantle associated with the overriding plate  the forearc lies between the trench and the volcanic arc  globally  forearcs have the lowest heatflow from the interior earth because there is no asthenosphere  convecting mantle  between the forearc lithosphere and the cold subducting needed the inner trench wall marks the edge of the overriding plate and the outermost forearc  the forearc consists of igneous and metamorphic crust  and this crust may act as buttress to a growing accretionary wedge  formed from sediments scraped off the top of the downgoing plate   if the flux of sediments is high  material transfers from the subducting plate to the overriding plate  in this case an accretionary prism grows and the location of the trench migrates progressively away from the volcanic arc over the life of the convergent margin  convergent margins with growing accretionary prisms are called accretionary margins and make up nearly half of all convergent margins  if the incoming sediment flux is low  material is scraped from the overriding plate by the subducting plate in a process called subduction erosion  this material is then carried down into the subduction zone  in this case  the location of the trench migrates towards the magmatic arc over the life of the convergent margin  convergent margins experiencing subduction erosion are called non-accretionary  or erosive margins and comprise more than half of convergent plate boundaries  this is an oversimplification  because the same section of margin may experience both sediment accretion and subduction erosion throughout its active time span the asymmetric profile across a trench reflects fundamental differences in materials and tectonic evolution  the outer trench wall and outer swell comprise seafloor that takes several million years to move from where subduction-related  deformation begins to sinking beneath the overriding plate  in contrast  the inner trench wall is deformed by plate interactions for the entire life of the convergent margin  the forearc is continuously subjected to subduction-related  deformation and earthquakes  this protracted deformation and shaking ensures that the inner trench slope is controlled by the angle of repose of whatever material comprises it  because the inner slope of non-accretionary  trenches are composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks instead of deformed sediments  these trenches have steeper inner walls than accretionary trenches the composition of the inner trench slope and a first-order  control on trench morphology is determined by sediment supply  active accretionary prisms are common in trenches near continents where rivers or glaciers supply great volumes of sediment to the trench  these filled trenches may lack the bathymetric expression of a trench  the cascadia margin of the northwest usa is a filled trench  the result of sedimentation by the rivers of the western united states and canada the lesser antilles convergent margin demonstrates the importance of proximity to sediment sources for trench morphology  in the south  near the mouth of the orinoco river  there is no morphological trench and the forearc  including the accretionary prism  is almost 500  km (310  mi  wide  the large accretionary prism reaches above sea level to form the islands of barbados and trinidad  northward  the forearc narrows  the accretionary prism disappears  and  north of ~17°n,  the morphology of a trench dominates  further north  far from major sediment sources  the puerto rico trench is over 8,600  m (28,200  ft  deep and there is no active accretionary prism a similar relationship between proximity to rivers  forearc width  and trench morphology can be observed from east to west along the alaskan-aleutian  convergent margin  the convergent plate boundary offshore alaska changes along its strike from a filled trench with broad forearc in the east  near the coastal rivers of alaska  to a deep trench with narrow forearc in the west  offshore the aleutian islands   another example is the makran convergent margin offshore pakistan and iran  which is a trench filled by sediments from the tigris-euphrates  and indus rivers  thick accumulations of turbidites along a trench can be supplied by down-axis  transport of sediments that enter the trench 1,000–2,000  km (620–1,240  mi  away  as is found for the peru–chile trench south of valparaíso and for the aleutian trench convergence rate can also be important for controlling trench depth—especially for trenches near continents—because slow convergence makes the convergent margin capacity insufficient to dispose of sediment  an evolution in trench morphology can be expected  as oceans close and continents converge  while the ocean is wide  the trench may be far from continental sources of sediment and so may be deep  as continents approach each other  the trench can fill with continental sediments and become shallower  a simple way to approximate when the transition from subduction to collision has occurred is when the plate boundary previously marked by a trench is filled enough to rise above sea level accretionary prisms grow in two ways  by frontal accretion  whereby sediments are scraped off the downgoing plate  bulldozer-fashion,  near the trench  and by underplating of subducted sediments  and sometimes oceanic crust  along the shallow parts of the subduction decollement  frontal accretion over the life of a convergent margin results in younger sediments defining the outermost part of the accretionary prism and the oldest sediments defining the innermost portion  older  inner  parts of the accretionary prism are more lithified and have steeper structures than the younger  outer  needed  underplating is difficult to detect in modern subduction zones but may be recorded in ancient accretionary prisms such as the franciscan group of california in the form of tectonic mélanges and duplex structures different modes of accretion are reflected in the morphology of the inner slope of the trench  which generally shows three morphological provinces  the lower slope comprises imbricate thrust slices that form ridges  the mid slope may comprise a bench or terraces  the upper slope is smoother but may be cut by submarine canyons  because accretionary convergent margins have high relief  are continuously deforming  and accommodate a large flux of sediments  they are vigorous systems of sediment dispersal and accumulation  sediment transport is controlled by submarine landslides  debris flows  turbidity currents  and contourites  submarine canyons transport sediment from beaches and rivers down the upper slope  these canyons form by channelized turbidites and generally lose definition with depth because continuous faulting disrupts the submarine needed  sediments move down the inner trench wall via channels and a series of fault-controlled  basins  the trench itself serves as an axis of sediment transport  if enough sediment moves to the trench  it may be completely filled so that turbidity currents are able to carry sediments well beyond the trench and may even surmount the outer swell  as in the eastern gulf of alaska  sediments from the rivers of north america spill over the filled cascadia trench and cross the juan de fuca plate to reach the spreading ridge several hundred kilometres to the west the slope of the inner trench slope of an accretionary convergent margin reflects continuous adjustments to the thickness and width of the accretionary prism  the prism maintains a ‘critical taper’  established in conformance with mohr–coulomb theory  with slope determined by the material properties of the sediments  a package of sediments scraped off the downgoing lithospheric plate deforms until it and the accretionary prism that it has been added to attain the maximum slope supported by the sediments  once this critical taper is attained  the wedge slides stably along its basal décollement  strain rate and hydrologic properties also influence the strength of the accretionary prism and the angle of critical taper  fluid pore pressures modify rock strength  low permeability and rapid convergence may result in pore pressures that exceed lithostatic pressure and thus a relatively weak accretionary prism with a shallowly tapered geometry  whereas high permeability and slow convergence result in lower pore pressure  stronger prisms  and steeper geometry the hellenic trench of the hellenic arc system is unusual because this convergent margin subducts evaporites  the slope of the surface of the southern flank of the mediterranean ridge  its accretionary prism  is low  about 1°,  indicating very low shear stress on the decollement at the base of the wedge  evaporites control the shallow taper of the accretionary complex both because their mechanical properties differ from those of siliciclastic sediments  and because of their effect on fluid flow and fluid pressure  which in turn control effective stress  in the 1970s,  the linear deeps of the hellenic trench south of crete were thought to be similar to trenches at other subduction zones  however  with the realization that the mediterranean ridge is an accretionary complex  it became apparent that the hellenic trench is actually a starved forearc basin  and that the plate boundary lies south of the mediterranean distant from an influx of continental sediments lack an accretionary prism  and the inner slope of such trenches is commonly composed of igneous or metamorphic rocks  non-accretionary  convergent margins are characteristic of  but not limited to  primitive arc systems  primitive arc systems are those built on oceanic lithosphere  such as the izu-bonin-mariana,  tonga-kermadec,  and scotia  south sandwich  arc systems  the inner trench slope of these convergent margins exposes the crust of the forearc  including basalt  gabbro  and serpentinized mantle peridotite  these exposures allow easy access to study the lower oceanic crust and upper mantle in place and provide a unique opportunity to study the magmatic products associated with the initiation of subduction zones  most ophiolites probably originate in a forearc environment during the initiation of subduction  and this setting favors ophiolite emplacement during collision with blocks of thickened crust  not all non-accretionary  convergent margins are associated with primitive arcs  trenches adjacent to continents where there is little influx of sediments carried by rivers  such as the central part of the peru–chile trench  may also lack an accretionary prism igneous basement of a nonaccretionary forearc may be continuously exposed by subduction erosion  this transfers material from the forearc to the subducting plate and can be accomplished by frontal erosion or basal erosion  frontal erosion is most active in the wake of seamounts being subducted beneath the forearc  subduction of large edifices  seamount tunneling  oversteepens the forearc  causing mass failures that carry debris towards and ultimately into the trench  this debris may be deposited in graben of the downgoing plate and subducted with it  in contrast  structures resulting from subduction erosion of the base of the forearc are difficult to recognize from seismic reflection profiles  so the possibility of basal erosion is difficult to confirm  subduction erosion may also diminish a once-robust  accretionary prism if the flux of sediments to the trench diminishes nonaccretionary forearcs may also be the site of serpentine mud volcanoes  these form where fluids released from the downgoing plate percolate upwards and interact with cold mantle lithosphere of the forearc  mantle peridotite is hydrated into serpentinite  which is much less dense than peridotite and so rises diapirically when it can  some nonaccretionary forearcs are subjected to strong extensional stresses  for example the marianas  and this allows buoyant serpentinite to rise to the seafloor where they form serpentinite mud volcanoes  chemosynthetic communities are also found on non-accretionary  margins such as the marianas  where they thrive on vents associated with serpentinite mud volcanoes trenches seem positionally stable over time  but scientists believe that some trenches—particularly those associated with subduction zones where two oceanic plates converge—move backward into the subducting this is called trench rollback or hinge retreat  also hinge rollback  and is one explanation for the existence of back-arc  basins slab rollback occurs during the subduction of two tectonic plates  and results in seaward motion of the trench  forces perpendicular to the slab at depth  the portion of the subducting plate within the mantle  are responsible for steepening of the slab in the mantle and ultimately the movement of the hinge and trench at the the driving force for rollback is the negative buoyancy of the slab with respect to the underlying mantle modified by the geometry of the slab back-arc  basins are often associated with slab rollback due to extension in the overriding plate as a response to the subsequent subhorizontal mantle flow from the displacement of the slab at forces are involved in the process of slab rollback  two forces acting against each other at the interface of the two subducting plates exert forces against one another  the subducting plate exerts a bending force  fpb  that supplies pressure during subduction  while the overriding plate exerts a force against the subducting plate  fts   the slab pull force  fsp  is caused by the negative buoyancy of the plate driving the plate to greater depths  the resisisting force from the surrounding mantle opposes the slab pull forces  interactions with the 660-km  discontinuity cause a deflection due to the buoyancy at the phase transition the unique interplay of these forces is what generates slab rollback  when the deep slab section obstructs the down-going  motion of the shallow slab section  slab rollback occurs  the subducting slab undergoes backward sinking due to the negative buoyancy forces causing a retrogradation of the trench hinge along the surface  upwelling of the mantle around the slab can create favorable conditions for the formation of a back-arc  tomography provides evidence for slab rollback  results demonstrate high temperature anomalies within the mantle suggesting subducted material is present in the ophiolites are viewed as evidence for such mechanisms as high pressure and temperature rocks are rapidly brought to the surface through the processes of slab rollback  which provides space for the exhumation of ophiolites slab rollback is not always a continuous process suggesting an episodic the episodic nature of the rollback is explained by a change in the density of the subducting plate  such as the arrival of buoyant lithosphere  a continent  arc  ridge  or plateau   a change in the subduction dynamics  or a change in the plate kinematics  the age of the subducting plates does not have any effect on slab nearby continental collisions have an effect on slab rollback  continental collisions induce mantle flow and extrusion of mantle material  which causes stretching and arc-trench  in the area of the southeast pacific  there have been several rollback events resulting in the formation of numerous back-arc  with the mantle discontinuities play a significant role in slab rollback  stagnation at the 660-km  discontinuity causes retrograde slab motion due to the suction forces acting at the slab rollback induces mantle return flow  which causes extension from the shear stresses at the base of the overriding plate  as slab rollback velocities increase  circular mantle flow velocities also increase  accelerating extension extension rates are altered when the slab interacts with the discontinuities within the mantle at 410  km and 660  km depth  slabs can either penetrate directly into the lower mantle  or can be retarded due to the phase transition at 660  km depth creating a difference in buoyancy  an increase in retrograde trench migration  slab rollback  (2–4  cm yr  is a result of flattened slabs at the 660-km  discontinuity where the slab does not penetrate into the lower this is the case for the japan  java and izu-bonin  trenches  these flattened slabs are only temporarily arrested in the transition zone  the subsequent displacement into the lower mantle is caused by slab pull forces  or the destabilization of the slab from warming and broadening due to thermal diffusion  slabs that penetrate directly into the lower mantle result in slower slab rollback rates (~1–3  cm yr  such as the mariana arc  tonga volume of water escaping from within and beneath the forearc results in some of earth’s most dynamic and complex interactions between aqueous fluids and rocks  most of this water is trapped in pores and fractures in the upper lithosphere and sediments of the subducting plate  the average forearc is underrun by a solid volume of oceanic sediment that is 400  m (1,300  ft  thick  this sediment enters the trench with 50–60%  porosity  these sediments are progressively squeezed as they are subducted  reducing void space and forcing fluids out along the decollement and up into the overlying forearc  which may or may not have an accretionary prism  sediments accreted to the forearc are another source of fluids  water is also bound in hydrous minerals  especially clays and opal  increasing pressure and temperature experienced by subducted materials converts the hydrous minerals to denser phases that contain progressively less structurally bound water  water released by dehydration accompanying phase transitions is another source of fluids introduced to the base of the overriding plate  these fluids may travel through the accretionary prism diffusely  via interconnected pore spaces in sediments  or may follow discrete channels along faults  sites of venting may take the form of mud volcanoes or seeps and are often associated with chemosynthetic communities  fluids escaping from the shallowest parts of a subduction zone may also escape along the plate boundary but have rarely been observed draining along the trench axis  all of these fluids are dominated by water but also contain dissolved ions and organic molecules  especially methane  methane is often sequestered in an ice-like  form  methane clathrate  also called gas hydrate  in the forearc  these are a potential energy source and can rapidly break down  destabilization of gas hydrates has contributed to global warming in the past and will likely do so in the future chemosynthetic communities thrive where cold fluids seep out of the forearc  cold seep communities have been discovered in inner trench slopes down to depths of 7000  m in the western pacific  especially around japan  in the eastern pacific along north  central and south america coasts from the aleutian to the peru–chile trenches  on the barbados prism  in the mediterranean  and in the indian ocean along the makran and sunda convergent margins  these communities receive much less attention than the chemosynthetic communities associated with hydrothermal vents  chemosynthetic communities are located in a variety of geological settings  above over-pressured  sediments in accretionary prisms where fluids are expelled through mud volcanoes or ridges  barbados  nankai and cascadia   along active erosive margins with faults  and along escarpments caused by debris slides  japan trench  peruvian margin   surface seeps may be linked to massive hydrate deposits and destabilization  e g  cascadia margin   high concentrations of methane and sulfide in the fluids escaping from the seafloor are the principal energy sources for chemosynthesis there are several factors that control the depth of trenches  the most important control is the supply of sediment  which fills the trench so that there is no bathymetric expression  it is therefore not surprising that the deepest trenches  deeper than 8,000  m (26,000  ft   are all nonaccretionary  in contrast  all trenches with growing accretionary prisms are shallower than 8,000  m (26,000  ft   a second order control on trench depth is the age of the lithosphere at the time of subduction  because oceanic lithosphere cools and thickens as it ages  it subsides  the older the seafloor  the deeper it lies  and this determines the minimum depth from which the seafloor begins to descend  this obvious correlation can be removed by looking at the relative depth  the difference between regional seafloor depth and maximum trench depth  relative depth may be controlled by the age of the lithosphere at the trench  the convergence rate  and the dip of the subducted slab at intermediate depths  finally  narrow slabs can sink and roll back more rapidly than broad plates  because it is easier for underlying asthenosphere to flow around the edges of the sinking plate  such slabs may have steep dips at relatively shallow depths and so may be associated with unusually deep trenches  such as the challenger deep     the 5  deepest trenches in the world
