 submarine canyon -  wikipediaa submarine canyon is a steep-sided  valley cut into the seabed of the continental slope  sometimes extending well onto the continental shelf  having nearly vertical walls  and occasionally having canyon wall heights of up to 5  km  from canyon floor to canyon rim  as with the great bahama just as above-sea-level  canyons serve as channels for the flow of water across land  submarine canyons serve as channels for the flow of turbidity currents across the seafloor  turbidity currents are flows of dense  sediment laden waters that are supplied by rivers  or generated on the seabed by storms  submarine landslides  earthquakes  and other soil disturbances  turbidity currents travel down slope at great speed  as much as 70  km h   eroding the continental slope and finally depositing sediment onto the abyssal plain  where the particles settle 3%  of submarine canyons include shelf valleys that have cut transversely across continental shelves  and which begin with their upstream ends in alignment with and sometimes within the mouths of large rivers  such as the congo river and the hudson canyon  about 28.5%  of submarine canyons cut back into the edge of the continental shelf  whereas the majority  about 68.5%)  of submarine canyons have not managed at all to cut significantly across their continental shelves  having their upstream beginnings or  heads  on the continental slope  below the edge of continental formation of submarine canyons is believed to occur as the result of at least two main process  1)  erosion by turbidity current erosion  and 2)  slumping and mass wasting of the continental slope  while at first glance  the erosion patterns of submarine canyons may appear to mimic those of river-canyons  on land  due to the markedly different erosion processes that have been found to take place underwater at the soil  water interface  several notably different erosion patterns have been observed in the formation of typical submarine canyons have been found at depths greater than 2  km below sea level  some may extend seawards across continental shelves for hundreds of kilometres before reaching the abyssal plain  ancient examples have been found in rocks dating back to the turbidites are deposited at the downstream mouths or ends of canyons  building an abyssal fan submarine canyons are more common on the steep slopes found on active margins compared to those on the gentler slopes found on passive they show erosion through all substrates  from unlithified sediment to crystalline rock  canyons are steeper  shorter  more dendritic and more closely spaced on active than on passive continental the walls are generally very steep and can be near vertical  the walls are subject to erosion by bioerosion  or slumping  there are an estimated 9,477  submarine canyons on earth  covering about 11%  of the continental mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of submarine canyons  their primary causes have been subject to debate since the early early and obvious theory was that the canyons present today were carved during glacial times  when sea level was about 125  meters below present sea level  and rivers flowed to the edge of the continental shelf  however  while many  but not all  canyons are found offshore from major rivers  subaerial river erosion cannot have been active to the water depths as great as 3000  meters where canyons have been mapped  as it is well established  by many lines of evidence  that sea levels did not fall to those depths the major mechanism of canyon erosion is now thought to be turbidity currents and underwater landslides  turbidity currents are dense  sediment-laden  currents which flow downslope when an unstable mass of sediment that has been rapidly deposited on the upper slope fails  perhaps triggered by earthquakes  there is a spectrum of turbidity-  or density-current  types ranging from  muddy water  to massive mudflow  and evidence of both these end members can be observed in deposits associated with the deeper parts of submarine canyons and channels  such as lobate deposits  mudflow  and levees along channels mass wasting  slumping  and submarine landslides are forms of slope failures  the effect of gravity on a hillslope  observed in submarine canyons  mass wasting is the term used for the slower and smaller action of material moving downhill  slumping is generally used for rotational movement of masses on a hillside  landslides  or slides  generally comprise the detachment and displacement of sediment masses it is now understood that many mechanisms of submarine canyon creation have had effect to greater or lesser degree in different places  even within the same canyon  or at different times during a canyon s development  however  if a primary mechanism must be selected  the downslope lineal morphology of canyons and channels and the transportation of excavated or loose materials of the continental slope over extensive distances require that various kinds of turbidity or density currents act as major participants in addition to the processes described above  submarine canyons that are especially deep may form by another method  in certain cases  a sea with a bed significantly below sea level is cut off from the larger ocean to which it is usually connected  the sea which is normally repleted by contact and inflow from the ocean is now no longer replenished and hence dries up over a period of time  which can be very short if the local climate is arid  in this scenario  rivers that previously flowed into the sea at a sea level elevation now can cut far deeper into the bottom of the bed now exposed  the messinian salinity crisis is an example of this phenomenon  between five and six million years ago  the mediterranean sea became isolated from the atlantic ocean and evaporated away in roughly a thousand years  during this time  the nile river delta  among other rivers  extended far beyond its present location  both in depth and length  in a cataclysmic event  the mediterranean sea basin was flooded  one relevant consequence is that the submarine canyons eroded are now far below the present sea level
