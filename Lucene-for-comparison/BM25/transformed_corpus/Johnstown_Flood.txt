 johnstown flood -  wikipediathe johnstown flood  locally  the great flood of 1889)  occurred on may 31,  1889,  after the catastrophic failure of the south fork dam on the little conemaugh river 14  miles (23  km  upstream of the town of johnstown  pennsylvania  the dam broke after several days of extremely heavy rainfall  releasing 14.55  million cubic meters of water with a volumetric flow rate that temporarily equaled the average flow rate of the mississippi 2,209  according to one account  lost their lives  and the flood accounted for us$17  million of damage  about $453  million in 2016  american red cross  led by clara barton and with 50  volunteers  undertook a major disaster relief support for victims came from all over the united states and 18  foreign countries  after the flood  survivors suffered a series of legal defeats in their attempts to recover damages from the dam s owners  public indignation at that failure prompted the development in american law changing a fault-based  regime to strict liability the village of johnstown was founded in 1800  by the swiss immigrant joseph johns  anglicized from  schantz   where the stony creek and little conemaugh rivers joined to form the conemaugh river  it began to prosper with the building of the pennsylvania main line canal in 1836  and the construction in the 1850s  of the pennsylvania railroad and the cambria iron works  by 1889,  johnstown s industries had attracted numerous welsh and german immigrants  with a population of 30,000,  it was a growing industrial community known for the quality of its high  steep hills of the narrow conemaugh valley and the allegheny mountains range to the east kept development close to the riverfront areas  the valley had large amounts of runoff from rain and snowfall  the area surrounding johnstown is prone to flooding due to its location on the rivers  whose upstream watersheds include an extensive drainage basin of the allegheny plateau  adding to these factors  slag from the iron furnaces of the steel mills was dumped along the river to create more land for developers  artificial narrowing of the riverbed to maximize early industries left the city even more the conemaugh river immediately downstream of johnstown is hemmed in by steep mountainsides for about 10  miles (16  km   a roadside plaque alongside route 56,  which follows this river  proclaims that this stretch of valley is the deepest river gorge in north america east of the rocky mountains high above the city  the commonwealth of pennsylvania built the south fork dam between 1838  and 1853,  as part of a cross-state  canal system  the main line of public works  johnstown was the eastern terminus of the western division canal  supplied with water by lake conemaugh  the reservoir behind the dam  as railroads superseded canal barge transport  the commonwealth abandoned the canal and sold it to the pennsylvania railroad  the dam and lake were part of the purchase  and the railroad sold them to private clay frick led a group of speculators  including benjamin ruff  from pittsburgh to purchase the abandoned reservoir  modify it  and convert it into a private resort lake for their wealthy associates  many were connected through business and social links to carnegie steel  development included lowering the dam to make its top wide enough to hold a road  and putting a fish screen in the spillway  the screen also trapped debris   these alterations are thought to have increased the vulnerability of the dam  moreover  a system of relief pipes and valves  a feature of the original dam  previously sold off for scrap  was not replaced  so the club had no way of lowering the water level in the lake in case of an emergency  the members built cottages and a clubhouse to create the south fork fishing and hunting club  an exclusive and private mountain retreat  membership grew to include more than 50  wealthy pittsburgh steel  coal  and railroad conemaugh at the club s site was 450  feet (140  m  in elevation above johnstown  the lake was about 2  miles (3.2  km  long  about 1  mile (1.6  km  wide  and 60  feet (18  m  deep near the dam the dam was 72  feet (22  m  high and 931  feet (284  m  long  after 1881,  when the club opened  the dam frequently sprang leaks  it was patched  mostly with mud and needed  there had been some speculation as to the dam s integrity  and concerns had been raised by the head of the cambria iron works downstream in johnstown on may 28,  1889,  a low-pressure  area formed over nebraska and kansas  by the time this weather pattern reached western pennsylvania two days later  it had developed into what would be termed the heaviest rainfall event that had ever been recorded in that part of the united states  the u s  army signal corps estimated that 6  to 10  inches (150  to 250  mm  of rain fell in 24  hours over the during the night  small creeks became roaring torrents  ripping out trees and debris  telegraph lines were downed and rail lines were washed away  before daybreak  the conemaugh river that ran through johnstown was about to overwhelm its banks on the morning of may 31,  in a farmhouse on a hill just above the south fork dam  elias unger  president of the south fork fishing and hunting club  awoke to the sight of lake conemaugh swollen after a night-long  heavy rainfall  unger ran outside in the still-pouring  rain to assess the situation and saw that the water was nearly cresting the dam  he quickly assembled a group of men to save the face of the dam by trying to unclog the spillway  it was blocked by the broken fish trap and debris caused by the swollen waterline  other men tried digging a ditch at the other end of the dam  on the western abutment which was lower than the dam crest  the idea was to let more water out of the lake to try to prevent overtopping of the crest  but without success  most remained on top of the dam  some plowing earth to raise it  while others tried to pile mud and rock on the face to save the eroding wall john parke  an engineer for the south fork club  briefly considered cutting through the dam s end  where the pressure would be less  but decided against it as that would have ensured failure of the dam  twice  under orders from unger  parke rode on horseback to the nearby town of south fork to the telegraph office to send warnings to johnstown explaining the critical nature of the eroding dam  but the warnings were not passed to the authorities in town  as there had been many false alarms in the past of the south fork dam not holding against unger  parke  and the rest of the men continued working until exhausted to save the face of the dam  they abandoned their efforts at around 1:30  p m   fearing that their efforts were futile and the dam was at risk of imminent collapse  unger ordered all of his men to fall back to high ground on both sides of the dam where they could do nothing but wait  during the day in johnstown  the situation worsened as water rose to as high as 10  feet (3.0  in the streets  trapping some people in their houses between 2:50  and 2:55  p m  the south fork dam a lidar analysis of the conemaugh lake basin reveals that it contained 14.55  million cubic meters (3.843  billion gallons  of water at the moment the dam modern dam-breach  computer modeling reveals that it took approximately 65  minutes for most of the lake to empty after the dam began to the first town to be hit by the flood was south fork  the town was on high ground  and most of the people escaped by running up the nearby hills when they saw the dam spill over  some 20  to 30  houses were destroyed or washed away  and four people were killed continuing on its way downstream to johnstown  14  miles (23  km  west  the water picked up debris  such as trees  houses  and animals  at the conemaugh viaduct  a 78-foot  (24  m  high railroad bridge  the flood was momentarily stemmed when this debris jammed against the stone bridge s arch  but within seven minutes  the viaduct collapsed  allowing the flood to resume its course  however  owing to the delay at the stone arch  the flood waters gained renewed hydraulic head  resulting in a stronger  more abrupt wave of water hitting places downstream than otherwise would have been expected  the small town of mineral point  one mile (1.6  km  below the conemaugh viaduct  was the first populated place to be hit with this renewed force  about 30  families lived on the village s single street  after the flood  there were no structures  no topsoil  no sub-soil  – only the bedrock was left  the death toll here was approximately 16  people  in 2009,  studies showed that the flood s flow rate through the narrow valley exceeded 420,000  cubic feet per second (12,000  m3/s),  comparable to the flow rate of the mississippi river at its delta  which varies between 250,000  and 710,000  cu ft s (7,000  and 20,000  village of east conemaugh was next  one witness on high ground near the town described the water as almost obscured by debris  resembling  a huge hill rolling over and from his idle locomotive in the town s railyard  the engineer john hess heard and felt the rumbling of the approaching flood  throwing his locomotive into reverse  hess raced backward toward east conemaugh  the whistle blowing constantly  his warning saved many people who reached high ground  when the flood hit  it picked up the locomotive and floated it aside  hess himself survived  but at least 50  people died  including about 25  passengers stranded on trains in the town before hitting the main part of johnstown  the flood surge hit the cambria iron works at the town of woodvale  sweeping up railroad cars and barbed wire in its moil  of woodvale s 1,100  residents  314  died in the flood  boilers exploded when the flood hit the gautier wire works  causing black smoke seen by the johnstown residents  miles of its barbed wire became entangled in the debris in the flood waters some 57  minutes after the south fork dam collapsed  the flood hit johnstown  the residents were caught by surprise as the wall of water and debris bore down  traveling at 40  miles per hour (64  km h  and reaching a height of 60  feet (18  m  in places  some people  realizing the danger  tried to escape by running towards high ground but most people were hit by the surging floodwater  many people were crushed by pieces of debris  and others became caught in barbed wire from the wire factory upstream and or drowned  those who reached attics  or managed to stay afloat on pieces of floating debris  waited hours for help to arrive at johnstown  the stone bridge  which was a substantial arched structure  carried the pennsylvania railroad across the conemaugh river  the debris carried by the flood formed a temporary dam at the bridge  resulting in the flood surge rolling upstream along the stoney creek river  eventually  gravity caused the surge to return to the dam  causing a second wave to hit the city  but from a different some people who had been washed downstream became trapped in an inferno as the debris piled up against the stone bridge caught fire  at least 80  people died there  the fire at the stone bridge burned for three days  after floodwaters receded  the pile of debris at the bridge was seen to cover 30  acres (12  ha   and reached 70  feet (21  m  in height  it took workers three months to remove the mass of debris  the delay owing in part to the huge quantity of steel barbed wire from the ironworks  dynamite was eventually still standing and in use as a railroad bridge  the stone bridge is a landmark associated with survival and recovery from the flood  in 2008,  it was restored in a project including new lighting as part of commemorative activities related to the flood the total death toll was calculated originally as 2,209  making the disaster the largest loss of civilian life in the united states at the time  this number of deaths was later surpassed by fatalities in the 1900  galveston hurricane and the september 11,  2001  terrorist attacks  however  as pointed out by david mccullough in 1968   pages 266  and a man reported as presumed dead  not known to have been found  had survived  in 1900,  leroy temple showed up in johnstown to reveal he had not died but had extricated himself from the flood debris at the stone bridge below johnstown and walked out of the valley  until 1900  temple had been living in beverly  massachusetts  therefore  the official death toll should be entire families died in the including 396  children  124  women and 198  men were widowed  98  children were orphaned  one third of the dead  777  people  were never identified  their remains were buried in the  plot of the unknown  in grandview cemetery in westmont it was the worst flood to hit the u s  in the 19th  century  sixteen hundred homes were destroyed  $17  million in property damage levied  approx  $497  million in 2016),  and 4  square miles (10  km2)  of downtown johnstown were completely destroyed  clean-up  operations continued for years  although cambria iron and steel s facilities were heavily damaged  they returned to full production within a year and a seven days and nights  workmen built a wooden trestle bridge to temporarily replace the huge stone railroad viaduct  which had been destroyed by the flood  the pennsylvania railroad restored service to pittsburgh  55  miles (89  km  away  by june 2.  food  clothing  medicine  and other provisions began arriving by rail  morticians traveled by railroad  johnstown s first call for help requested coffins and undertakers  the demolition expert  dynamite bill  flinn and his 900-man  crew cleared the wreckage at the stone bridge  they carted off debris  distributed food  and erected temporary housing  at its peak  the army of relief workers totaled about 7,000.one  of the first outsiders to arrive was clara barton  nurse  founder and president of the american red barton arrived on june 5,  1889,  to lead the group s first major disaster relief effort  she did not leave for more than 5  months  donations for the relief effort came from all over the united states and overseas  $3,742,818.78  was collected for the johnstown relief effort from within the u s  and 18  foreign countries  including russia  turkey  france  great britain  australia  and germany frank shomo  the last known survivor of the 1889  flood  died march 20,  1997,  at the age of have continued to be a concern for johnstown  which had major flooding in 1894,  1907,  1924,  1936,  and 1977.  the biggest flood of the first half of the 20th  century was the st  patrick s day flood of march 1936.  it also reached pittsburgh  where it was known as the great pittsburgh flood of 1936.  following the 1936  flood  the u s  army corps of engineers dredged the river within the city and built concrete river walls  creating a channel nearly 20  feet deep  upon completion  the corps proclaimed johnstown  flood free  the new river walls withstood hurricane agnes in 1972,  but on the night of july 19,  1977,  a severe thunderstorm dropped 11  inches of rain in eight hours on the watershed above the city and the rivers began to rise  by dawn  the city was under water that reached as high as 8  feet (2.4  m   seven counties were declared a disaster area  suffering $200  million in property damage  and 78  people died  forty were killed by the laurel run dam failure  another 50,000  were rendered homeless as a result of this "100-year  flood   markers on a corner of city hall at 401  main street show the height of the crests of the 1889,  1936,  and 1977  floods in the years following the disaster  some people blamed the members of the south fork fishing and hunting club for their modifications to the dam and failure to maintain it properly  the club had bought and redesigned the dam to turn the area into a vacation retreat in the mountains  they were accused of failing to maintain the dam properly  so that it was unable to contain the additional water of the unusually heavy rainfall popular feeling ran high and was best summed up in the concluding lines of isaac reed s poem all the horrors that hell could wish  such was the price that was paid for – club was successfully defended by the firm of knox and reed  now reed smith llp   whose partners philander knox and james hay reed were both club members  the club was never held legally responsible for the disaster  the court held the dam break to have been an act of god  and granted the survivors no legal compensation individual members of the club  millionaires in their day  contributed to the recovery  along with about half of the club members  henry clay frick donated thousands of dollars to the relief effort in johnstown  after the flood  andrew carnegie  already known as an industrialist and philanthropist  built the town a new library on june 5,  1889,  five days after the dam breach flood  the american society of civil engineers  asce  appointed a committee of four prominent engineers to investigate the cause of the disaster  this committee was led by the esteemed james b  francis  a hydraulic engineer best known for his work related to canals  flood control  turbine design  dam construction  and hydraulic calculations  francis was a founding member of the asce and served as its president from november 1880  to january 1882.  the asce committee visited the south fork dam  reviewed the original engineering design of the dam and modifications made during repairs  interviewed eyewitnesses  commissioned a topographic survey of the dam remnants  and performed hydrologic calculations  in their final they concluded the south fork dam would have failed even if it had been maintained within the original design specifications  i e   with a higher embankment crest and with five large discharge pipes at the dam’s base  this claim by the asce committee has now been asce committee completed their investigation report on january 15,  1890,  but the report was sealed and not shared with other asce members or the at asce’s annual convention in june 1890,  committee member max becker was quoted as saying “we will hardly our investigation  report this session  unless pressed to do so  as we do not want to become involved in any although many asce members clamored for the report  it was not published in the society’s transactions until two years after the disaster  in june hydraulic analysis published in 2016  confirms what had long been suspected  that the changes made to the dam by the south fork fishing and hunting club severely reduced the ability of the dam to withstand major lowering the dam by as much as 0.9  meter (3  ft  and failing to replace the discharge pipes at the base of the dam cut in half the safe discharge capacity of the this fatal lowering of the dam greatly reduced the capacity of the main spillway and virtually eliminated the action of an emergency spillway on the western abutment  walter frank first documented the presence of that emergency spillway in a 1988  asce the existence of the emergency spillway is supported by topographic data from which shows the western abutment to be about one foot lower than the crest of the dam remnants  even after the dam had previously been lowered as much as 3  feet by the south fork fishing and hunting adding the width of the emergency spillway to that of the main spillway yields the total width of spillway  wasteway  capacity that had been specified in the 1847  design of william morris  a state engineer  lowering the top of the dam by the club eliminated nearly all of the capacity of the emergency spillway and greatly reduced the discharge capacity of the main spillway on the eastern side  the dam was now vulnerable to large storm events and was unable to survive the may 1889  were unable to recover damages in court because of the club s ample resources  first  the wealthy club owners had designed the club s financial structure to keep their personal assets separated from it and  secondly  it was difficult for any suit to prove that any particular owner had behaved negligently  though the former reason was probably more central to the failure of survivors  suits against the club  the latter received coverage and extensive criticism in the national press as a result of this criticism  in the 1890s,  state courts around the country adopted rylands v  fletcher  a british common-law  precedent which had formerly been largely ignored in the united states  state courts  adoption of rylands  which held that a non-negligent  defendant could be held liable for damage caused by the unnatural use of land  foreshadowed the legal system s 20th-century  acceptance of strict point park in johnstown  at the confluence of the stonycreek and little conemaugh rivers  an eternal flame burns in memory of the flood victims the carnegie library is now owned by the johnstown historical society  which has adapted it for use as the flood museum portions of the stone bridge have been made part of the johnstown flood national memorial  established in 1969  and managed by the national park service the flood has been the subject or setting for numerous histories  novels  and other works as well there is
