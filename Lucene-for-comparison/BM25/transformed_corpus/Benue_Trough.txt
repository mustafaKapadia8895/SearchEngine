 benue trough -  wikipediathe benue trough is a major geological formation underlying a large part of nigeria and extending about 1,000  km northeast from the bight of benin to lake chad  it is part of the broader central african rift trough has its southern limit at the northern boundary of the niger delta  where it dips down and is overlaid with tertiary and more recent sediments  it extends in a northeasterly direction to the chad basin  and is about 150  km wide  the trough is arbitrarily divided into lower  middle and upper regions  and the upper region is further divided into the gongola and yola arms  the anambra basin in the west of the lower region is more recent than the rest of the trough  being formed during a later period of compression  but is considered part of the benue trough was formed by rifting of the central west african basement  beginning at the start of the cretaceous 1]  at first  the trough accumulated sediments deposited by rivers and lakes  during the late early to middle cretaceous  the basin subsided rapidly and was covered by the sea  sea floor sediment accumulated  especially in the southern abakaliki rift  under oxygen-deficient  bottom in the upper cretaceous  the benue trough probably formed the main link between the gulf of guinea and the tethys ocean  predecessor of the mediterranean sea  via the chad and iullemmeden towards the end of this period the basin rose above sea level  and extensive coal forming swamps developed  particularly in the anambra the trough is estimated to contain 5,000  m of cretaceous sediments and volcanic common explanation of the trough s formation is that it is an aulacogen  an abandoned arm of a three-armed  radial rift system  the other two arms continued to spread during the break-up  of gondwana  as south america separated from the two continents seem to have started to split apart at what are now their southern tips  with the rift extending up the modern coastlines to the benue trough  then later split along what is now the southern coast of west africa and the north eastern coast of south america  as the continents were wedged apart  the trough opened up  when separation was complete  the southern part of africa swung back to some extent  with the sediments in the benue trough compressed and during the santonian age  around 84  million years ago  the basin underwent intense compression and folding  forming over 100  anticlines and synclines  the deposits in the benue trough were displaced westwards at this time  causing subsidence of the anambra refinement to the model involves the rise of a mantle plume  where abnormal heat leads to melting of the upper mantle  thinning and stretching the crust  followed by rifting of the weakened crust  this may have been repeated several times  with the benue trough deformed between rifting the same plume may be responsible for the line of volcanoes in cameroon along the central african shear zone and for the volcanic island of st  helena in the atlantic periods of magmatic activity  volcanic action  have been identified  147–106  ma  97–81  ma and 68–49  ma  the first is prominent in the north of the trough  and contemporary with magmatism in brazil  probably occurring during a period of crustal extension before the atlantic started to open  the second is found only in the south of the trough  and may belong to a period when the extension of the atlantic had slowed down  ending with a period of compression  the third and last period is also found only in the south of the trough  and may be related to an isostatic response to the earlier crustal mantle plume activity was probably limited in its effect  with most of the basins in the trough being created from a combination of extension and strike-slip  faults  the faults extend into the ocean with the chain and charcot fault zones  and have their counterparts in northeastern is rich in coal deposits derived from terrestrial organic matter  most of which lie in the benue trough  these are mined in enugu the enugu deposits formed in brackish marshes during the late campanian -  early maastrichtian ages  around 70  during this time  the anambra basin became silted up with thick vegetation growing in low-lying  marshes on a broad delta fan deposited by rivers from the interior  later  the deep layer of vegetation became buried under coarse coal is potentially a source for oil and natural gas  an exploratory well drilled in the gongola basin of the upper region in 2003  found no oil  although there was a narrow layer of coal between 4,710  ft and 4,770
