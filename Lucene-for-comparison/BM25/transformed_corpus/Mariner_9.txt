 mariner 9  -  wikipediamariner 9   mariner mars '71    mariner-i)  was an unmanned nasa space probe that contributed greatly to the exploration of mars and was part of the mariner program  mariner 9  was launched toward mars on may 30,  from cape canaveral air force station and reached the planet on november 14  of the same becoming the first spacecraft to orbit another – only narrowly beating the soviets  mars 2  and mars 3,  which both arrived within a month  after months of dust storms it managed to send back clear pictures of the surface mariner 9  returned 7329  images over the course of its mission  which concluded in october 9  was designed to continue the atmospheric studies begun by mariner 6  and 7,  and to map over 70%  of the martian surface from the lowest altitude (1,500  kilometers (930  mi   and at the highest resolutions  from 1  kilometer per pixel to 100  meters per pixel  of any mars mission up to that point  an infrared radiometer was included to detect heat sources in search of evidence of volcanic activity  it was to study temporal changes in the martian atmosphere and surface  mars  two moons were also to be analyzed  mariner 9  more than met its objectives under original plans  a dual mission was to be flown like mariners 6–7,  however the launch failure of mariner 8  ruined this scheme and forced nasa planners to fall back on a simpler one-probe  mission  nasa still held out hope that another mariner probe and atlas-centaur  could be readied before the 1971  mars launch window closed  a few logistical problems emerged  including the lack of an available centaur payload shroud of the correct configuration for the mariner probes  however there was a shroud in nasa s inventory which could be modified  convair also had an available centaur stage on hand and could have an atlas readied in time  but the idea was ultimately abandoned for lack of funding mariner 9  was mated to atlas-centaur  ac-23  on may 9  with investigation into mariner 8's  failure ongoing  the malfunction was traced to a problem in the centaur s pitch control servoamplifier and because it was not clear if the spacecraft itself had been responsible  rfi testing was conducted on mariner 9  to ensure the probe was not releasing interference that could cause problems with the centaur s electronics  all testing came back negative and on may 22,  a tested and verified rate gyro package arrived from convair and was installed in the centaur liftoff took place on may 30  at 5:23  pm est  all launch vehicle systems performed normally and the mariner separated from the centaur at 13  minutes and 18  seconds after launch mariner 9  was the first spacecraft to orbit another planet  it carried an instrument payload similar to mariners 6  and 7,  but because of the need for a larger propulsion system to control the spacecraft in martian orbit  it weighed more than mariners 6  and 7  mariner 9  arrived at mars on november 14,  1971,  planetary scientists were surprised to find the atmosphere was thick with  a planet-wide  robe of dust  the largest storm ever observed   the surface was totally obscured  mariner 9's  computer was thus reprogrammed from earth to delay imaging of the surface for a couple of months until the dust settled  the main surface imaging did not get underway until mid-january  1972.  however  surface-obscured  images did contribute to the collection of mars science  including understanding of the existence of several huge high-altitude  volcanoes of the tharsis bulge that gradually became visible as the dust storm abated  this unexpected situation made a strong case for the desirability of studying a planet from orbit rather than merely flying it also highlighted the importance of flexible mission software  the soviet union s mars 2  and mars 3  probes  which arrived during the same dust storm  were unable to adapt to the unexpected conditions  which severely limited the amount of data that they were able to collect after 349  days in orbit  mariner 9  had transmitted 7,329  images  covering 85%  of mars  surface  whereas previous flyby missions had returned less than one thousand images covering only a small portion of the planetary the images revealed river beds  craters  massive extinct volcanoes  such as olympus mons  the largest known volcano in the solar system  mariner 9  led directly to its reclassification from nix olympica   canyons  including the valles marineris  a system of canyons over about 2,500  miles (4,020  km  long   evidence of wind and water erosion and deposition  weather fronts  fogs  and mars  small moons  phobos and deimos  were also findings from the mariner 9  mission underpinned the later viking enormous valles marineris canyon system is named after mariner 9  in honor of its depleting its supply of attitude control gas  the spacecraft was turned off on october 27,  ultraviolet spectrometer aboard mariner 9  was constructed by the laboratory for atmospheric and space physics at the university of colorado  boulder  colorado  the ultraviolet spectrometer team was led by professor charles barth the infrared interferometer spectrometer  iris  team was led by dr  rudolf a  hanel from nasa goddard spaceflight center  gsfc   the iris instrument was built by texas instruments  dallas  texas the infrared radiometer  irr  team was led by professor gerald neugebauer from the california institute of technology  caltech  to control for errors in the reception of the grayscale image data sent by mariner 9   caused by a low signal-to-noise  ratio   the data had to be encoded before transmission using a so-called  error-correcting  code  ecc   without ecc  noise would have made up roughly a quarter of a received image  while the ecc encoded the data in a redundant way which allowed for the reconstruction of the sent image data at reception as the flown hardware was constrained with regards to weight  power consumption  storage and computing power  some considerations had to be put into choosing an error-correcting  code  and it was decided to use a hadamard code for mariner 9.  each image pixel was represented as a 6-bit  binary value  which had 64  possible grayscale levels  because of limitations of the transmitter  the maximum useful data length was about 30  bits  instead of using a repetition code  a 6,  16]  punctured hadamard code was used  which is also a 1st-order  reed-muller  code  errors of up to seven bits per each 32-bit  word could be corrected using this compared to a five-repetition  code  the error correcting properties of this hadamard code were much better  yet its rate was comparable  the efficient decoding algorithm was an important factor in the decision to use this code  the circuitry used was called the  green machine   which employed the fast fourier transform  increasing the decoding speed by a factor of 9  remains a derelict satellite in mars it is expected to remain in orbit until approximately 2022,  when the spacecraft is projected to enter the martian atmosphere and either burn up or crash into the planet s
