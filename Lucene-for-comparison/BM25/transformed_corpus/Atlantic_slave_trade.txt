 atlantic slave trade -  wikipediathe atlantic slave trade or transatlantic slave trade involved the transportation by slave traders of enslaved african people  mainly from africa to the americas  and then their sale there  the slave trade used mainly the triangular trade route and its middle passage  and existed from the 16th  to the 19th  centuries  the vast majority of those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were africans from central and western africa  who had been sold by other west africans to western european slave traders  with a small number being captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids   who brought them to the the south atlantic and caribbean economies especially were dependent on the supply of secure labour for the production of commodity crops  making goods and clothing to sell in europe  this was crucial to those western european countries which  in the late 17th  and 18th  centuries  were vying with each other to create overseas portuguese were the first to engage in the atlantic slave trade in the 16th  century  in 1526,  they completed the first transatlantic slave voyage to brazil  and other european countries soon shipowners regarded the slaves as cargo to be transported to the americas as quickly and cheaply as there to be sold to work on coffee  tobacco  cocoa  sugar and cotton plantations  gold and silver mines  rice fields  construction industry  cutting timber for ships  in skilled labour  and as domestic servants  the first africans imported to the english colonies were classified as  indentured servants   like workers coming from england  and also as  apprentices for life   by the middle of the 17th  century  slavery had hardened as a racial caste  with the slaves and their offspring being legally the property of their owners  and children born to slave mothers were also slaves  as property  the people were considered merchandise or units of labour  and were sold at markets with other goods and services the major atlantic slave trading nations  ordered by trade volume  were  the portuguese  the british  the french  the spanish  and the dutch empires  several had established outposts on the african coast where they purchased slaves from local african these slaves were managed by a factor who was established on or near the coast to expedite the shipping of slaves to the new world  slaves were kept in a factory while awaiting shipment  current estimates are that about 12  million africans were shipped across the although the number purchased by the traders was considerably higher  as the passage had a high death near the beginning of the 19th  century  various governments acted to ban the trade  although illegal smuggling still occurred  in the early 21st  century  several governments issued apologies for the transatlantic slave trade the atlantic slave trade developed after trade contacts were established between the  old world  (afro-eurasia)  and the  new world   the americas   for centuries  tidal currents had made ocean travel particularly difficult and risky for the ships that were then available  and as such there had been very little  if any  maritime contact between the peoples living in these in the 15th  century  however  new european developments in seafaring technologies resulted in ships being better equipped to deal with the tidal currents  and could begin traversing the atlantic ocean  between 1600  and 1800,  approximately 300,000  sailors engaged in the slave trade visited west in doing so  they came into contact with societies living along the west african coast and in the americas which they had never previously historian pierre chaunu termed the consequences of european navigation  disenclavement   with it marking an end of isolation for some societies and an increase in inter-societal  contact for most john thornton noted   a number of technical and geographical factors combined to make europeans the most likely people to explore the atlantic and develop its he identified these as being the drive to find new and profitable commercial opportunities outside europe as well as the desire to create an alternative trade network to that controlled by the muslim empire of the middle east  which was viewed as a commercial  political and religious threat to european christendom  in particular  european traders wanted to trade for gold  which could be found in western africa  and also to find a maritime route to  the indies   india   where they could trade for luxury goods such as spices without having to obtain these items from middle eastern islamic many of the initial atlantic naval explorations were led by iberians  members of many european nationalities were involved  including sailors from portugal  spain  the italian kingdoms  england  france and the netherlands  this diversity led thornton to describe the initial  exploration of the atlantic  as  a truly international exercise  even if many of the dramatic discoveries were made under the sponsorship of the iberian monarchs   that leadership later gave rise to the myth that  the iberians were the sole leaders of the was practiced in some parts of and the americas for many centuries before the beginning of the atlantic slave trade  there is evidence that enslaved people from some parts of africa were exported to states in africa  europe  and asia prior to the european colonization of the the african slave trade provided a large number of slaves to europeans and many more to muslim atlantic slave trade was not the only slave trade from africa  although it was the largest in volume and intensity  as elikia m’bokolo wrote in le monde diplomatique the african continent was bled of its human resources via all possible routes  across the sahara  through the red sea  from the indian ocean ports and across the atlantic  at least ten centuries of slavery for the benefit of the muslim countries  from the ninth to the nineteenth      four million enslaved people exported via the red sea  another four through the swahili ports of the indian ocean  perhaps as many as nine million along the trans-saharan  caravan route  and eleven to twenty million  depending on the author  across the atlantic to john k  thornton  europeans usually bought enslaved people who were captured in endemic warfare between african some africans had made a business out of capturing africans from neighboring ethnic groups or war captives and selling a reminder of this practice is documented in the slave trade debates of england in the early 19th  century   all the old writers    concur in stating not only that wars are entered into for the sole purpose of making slaves  but that they are fomented by europeans  with a view to that people living around the niger river were transported from these markets to the coast and sold at european trading ports in exchange for muskets and manufactured goods such as cloth or however  the european demand for slaves provided a large new market for the already existing while those held in slavery in their own region of africa might hope to escape  those shipped away had little chance of returning to africa upon discovering new lands through their naval explorations  european colonisers soon began to migrate to and settle in lands outside their native continent  off the coast of africa  european migrants  under the directions of the kingdom of castile  invaded and colonised the canary islands during the 15th  century  where they converted much of the land to the production of wine and sugar  along with this  they also captured native canary islanders  the guanches  to use as slaves both on the islands and across the christian historian john thornton remarked   the actual motivation for european expansion and for navigational breakthroughs was little more than to exploit the opportunity for immediate profits made by raiding and the seizure or purchase of trade using the canary islands as a naval base  europeans  at the time primarily portuguese traders  began to move their activities down the western coast of africa  performing raids in which slaves would be captured to be later sold in the although initially successful in this venture   it was not long before african naval forces were alerted to the new dangers  and the portuguese ships began to meet strong and effective resistance   with the crews of several of them being killed by african sailors  whose boats were better equipped at traversing the west african coasts and river 1494,  the portuguese king had entered agreements with the rulers of several west african states that would allow trade between their respective peoples  enabling the portuguese to  tap into  the "well-developed  commercial economy in africa    without engaging in  peaceful trade became the rule all along the african coast   although there were some rare exceptions when acts of aggression led to violence  for instance  portuguese traders attempted to conquer the bissagos islands in in 1571  portugal  supported by the kingdom of kongo  took control of the south-western  region of angola in order to secure its threatened economic interest in the area  although kongo later joined a coalition in 1591  to force the portuguese out  portugal had secured a foothold on the continent that it continued to occupy until the 20th  despite these incidences of occasional violence between african and european forces  many african states ensured that any trade went on in their own terms  for instance  imposing custom duties on foreign ships  in 1525,  the kongolese king  afonso i  seized a french vessel and its crew for illegally trading on his have widely debated the nature of the relationship between these african kingdoms and the european traders  the guyanese historian walter rodney (1972)  has argued that it was an unequal relationship  with africans being forced into a  colonial  trade with the more economically developed europeans  exchanging raw materials and human resources  i e  slaves  for manufactured goods  he argued that it was this economic trade agreement dating back to the 16th  century that led to africa being underdeveloped in his own these ideas were supported by other historians  including ralph austen this idea of an unequal relationship was contested by john thornton (1998),  who argued that  the atlantic slave trade was not nearly as critical to the african economy as these scholars believed  and that  african manufacturing this period  was more than capable of handling competition from preindustrial however  anne bailey  commenting on thornton s suggestion that africans and europeans were equal partners in the atlantic slave trade  see africans as partners implies equal terms and equal influence on the global and intercontinental processes of the trade  africans had great influence on the continent itself  but they had no direct influence on the engines behind the trade in the capital firms  the shipping and insurance companies of europe and america  or the plantation systems in americas  they did not wield any influence on the building manufacturing centers of the atlantic slave trade is customarily divided into two eras  known as the first and second atlantic systems the first atlantic system was the trade of enslaved africans to  primarily  south american colonies of the portuguese and spanish empires  it accounted for slightly more than 3%  of all atlantic slave trade  it started  on a significant scale  in about and lasted until 1580  when portugal was temporarily united with spain  while the portuguese were directly involved in trading enslaved peoples  the spanish empire relied on the asiento system  awarding merchants  mostly from other countries  the license to trade enslaved people to their colonies  during the first atlantic system  most of these traders were portuguese  giving them a near-monopoly  during the era  some dutch  english  and french traders also participated in the slave after the union  portugal came under spanish legislation that prohibited it from directly engaging in the slave trade as a carrier  it became a target for the traditional enemies of spain  losing a large share of the trade to the dutch  english  and french the second atlantic system was the trade of enslaved africans by mostly english  portuguese  french and dutch traders  the main destinations of this phase were the caribbean colonies and brazil  as european nations built up economically slave-dependent  colonies in the new slightly more than 3%  of the enslaved people exported from africa were traded between 1450  and 1600,  and 16%  in the 17th  century it is estimated that more than half of the entire slave trade took place during the 18th  century  with the british  portuguese and french being the main carriers of nine out of ten slaves abducted in by the 1690s,  the english were shipping the most slaves from west they maintained this position during the 18th  century  becoming the biggest shippers of slaves across the however  it was the portuguese colony of angola and nearby kingdoms in the congo region which overwhelmingly dominated as the slave trade s main sources of slaves  with the angola city of luanda early serving as the main port for the portuguese slave by the 18th  century  angola had become the principal source of the atlantic slave the british and united states  bans on the african slave trade in 1808,  it declined  but the period after still accounted for 28.5%  of the total volume of the atlantic slave burial ground in campeche  mexico  suggests slaves had been brought there not long after hernán cortés completed the subjugation of aztec and mayan mexico in the 16th  century  the graveyard had been in use from approximately 1550  to the late 17th  first side of the triangle was the export of goods from europe to africa  a number of african kings and merchants took part in the trading of enslaved people from 1440  to about 1833.  for each captive  the african rulers would receive a variety of goods from europe  these included guns  ammunition  and other factory-made  goods  the second leg of the triangle exported enslaved africans across the atlantic ocean to the americas and the caribbean islands  the third and final part of the triangle was the return of goods to europe from the americas  the goods were the products of slave-labour  plantations and included cotton  sugar  tobacco  molasses and sir john hawkins  considered the pioneer of the british slave trade  was the first to run the triangular trade  making a profit at every stop the atlantic slave trade was the result of  among other things  labour shortage  itself in turn created by the desire of european colonists to exploit new world land and resources for capital profits  native peoples were at first utilized as slave labour by europeans until a large number died from overwork and old world alternative sources of labour  such as indentured servitude  failed to provide a sufficient workforce  many crops could not be sold for profit  or even grown  in europe  exporting crops and goods from the new world to europe often proved to be more profitable than producing them on the european mainland  a vast amount of labour was needed to create and sustain plantations that required intensive labour to grow  harvest  and process prized tropical crops  western africa  part of which became known as  the slave coast   and later central africa  became the source for enslaved people to meet the demand for labour  despite not being a part of the recognized slave coast  it has been acknowledged that angola and nearby kingdoms dominated as the main source for the slave basic reason for the constant shortage of labour was that  with large amounts of cheap land available and lots of landowners searching for workers  free european immigrants were able to become landowners themselves after a relatively short time  thus increasing the need for jefferson attributed the use of slave labour in part to the climate  and the consequent idle leisure afforded by slave labour   for in a warm climate  no man will labour for himself who can make another labour for him  this is so true  that of the proprietors of slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to played a direct role in the slave trade  selling their captives or prisoners of war to european the prisoners and captives who were sold were usually from neighbouring or enemy ethnic needed  these captive slaves were considered  other   not part of the people of the ethnic group or  tribe   african kings held no particular loyalty to them  sometimes criminals would be sold so that they could no longer commit crimes in that area  most other slaves were obtained from kidnappings  or through raids that occurred at gunpoint through joint ventures with the but some african kings refused to sell any of their captives or criminals  king jaja of opobo  a former slave  refused to do business with the slavers needed africans also participated in the slave trade through intermarriage  or cassare  meaning  to set up house   it is derived from the portuguese word  casar   meaning  to marry   cassare created political and economic bonds between european and african slave traders  cassare was a pre-european  practice used to integrate the  other  from a differing african tribe  powerful west african groups used these marriages as an alliance used to strengthen their trade networks with european men by marrying off african women from families with ties to the slave trade  early on in the atlantic slave trade  these marriages were common  the marriages were even performed using african customs  which europeans did not object to  seeing how important the connections europeans were the market for slaves  europeans rarely entered the interior of africa  due to fear of disease and fierce african in africa  convicted criminals could be punished by enslavement  a punishment which became more prevalent as slavery became more lucrative  since most of these nations did not have a prison system  convicts were often sold or used in the scattered local domestic slave needed as of 1778,  thomas kitchin estimated that europeans were bringing an estimated 52,000  slaves to the caribbean yearly  with the french bringing the most africans to the french west indies (13,000  out of the yearly the atlantic slave trade peaked in the last two decades of the 18th  during and following the kongo civil wars among tiny states along the niger river s igbo-inhabited  region and the accompanying banditry also spiked in this another reason for surplus supply of enslaved people was major warfare conducted by expanding states  such as the kingdom of the oyo empire  and the asante of slavery varied both in africa and in the new world  in general  slavery in africa was not heritable – that is  the children of slaves were free – while in the americas  children of slave mothers were considered born into slavery  this was connected to another distinction  slavery in west africa was not reserved for racial or religious minorities  as it was in european colonies  although the case was otherwise in places such as somalia  where bantus were taken as slaves for the ethnic treatment of slaves in africa was more variable than in the americas  at one extreme  the kings of dahomey routinely slaughtered slaves in hundreds or thousands in sacrificial rituals  and slaves as human sacrifices were also known in on the other hand  slaves in other places were often treated as part of the family   adopted children   with significant rights including the right to marry without their masters  scottish explorer mungo park wrote the slaves in africa  i suppose  are nearly in the proportion of three to one to the freemen  they claim no reward for their services except food and clothing  and are treated with kindness or severity  according to the good or bad disposition of their masters     the slaves which are thus brought from the interior may be divided into two distinct classes – first  such as were slaves from their birth  having been born of enslaved mothers  secondly  such as were born free  but who afterwards  by whatever means  became slaves  those of the first description are by far the most the americas  slaves were denied the right to marry freely and masters did not generally accept them as equal members of the family  new world slaves were considered the property of their owners  and slaves convicted of revolt or murder were were eight principal areas used by europeans to buy and ship slaves to the western hemisphere  the number of enslaved people sold to the new world varied throughout the slave trade  as for the distribution of slaves from regions of activity  certain areas produced far more enslaved people than others  between 1650  and 1900,  10.24  million enslaved africans arrived in the americas from the following regions in the following were over 173  city-states  and kingdoms in the african regions affected by the slave trade between 1502  and 1853  when brazil became the last atlantic import nation to outlaw the slave trade  of those 173,  no fewer than 68  could be deemed nation states with political and military infrastructures that enabled them to dominate their neighbours  nearly every present-day  nation had a pre-colonial  predecessor  sometimes an african empire with which european traders had to barter the different ethnic groups brought to the americas closely corresponds to the regions of heaviest activity in the slave trade  over 45  distinct ethnic groups were taken to the americas during the trade  of the 45,  the ten most prominent  according to slave documentation of the era are listed transatlantic slave trade resulted in a vast and as yet still unknown loss of life for african captives both in and outside america  approximately 1.2  – 2.4  million africans died during their transport to the new more died soon upon their arrival  the number of lives lost in the procurement of slaves remains a mystery but may equal or exceed the number who survived to be savage nature of the trade led to the destruction of individuals and cultures  the following figures do not include deaths of enslaved africans as a result of their labour  slave revolts  or diseases suffered while living among new world populations historian ana lucia araujo has noted that the process of enslavement did not end with arrival on the american shores  the different paths taken by the individuals and groups who were victims of the atlantic slave trade were influenced by different factors—including the disembarking region  the kind of work performed  gender  age  religion  and by patrick manning are that about 12  million slaves entered the atlantic trade between the 16th  and 19th  century  but about 1.5  million died on board ship  about 10.5  million slaves arrived in the americas  besides the slaves who died on the middle passage  more africans likely died during the slave raids in africa and forced marches to ports  manning estimates that 4  million died inside africa after capture  and many more died young  manning s estimate covers the 12  million who were originally destined for the atlantic  as well as the 6  million destined for asian slave markets and the 8  million destined for african to kimani nehusi  the presence of european slavers affected the way in which the legal code in african societies responded to offenders  crimes traditionally punishable by some other form of punishment became punishable by enslavement and sale to slave needed  according to david stannard s american holocaust  50%  of african deaths occurred in africa as a result of wars between native kingdoms  which produced the majority of this includes not only those who died in battles but also those who died as a result of forced marches from inland areas to slave ports on the various the practice of enslaving enemy combatants and their villages was widespread throughout western and west central africa  although wars were rarely started to procure slaves  the slave trade was largely a by-product  of tribal and state warfare as a way of removing potential dissidents after victory or financing future however  some african groups proved particularly adept and brutal at the practice of enslaving  such as oyo  benin  igala  kaabu  asanteman  dahomey  the aro confederacy and the imbangala war letters written by the manikongo  nzinga mbemba afonso  to the king joão iii of portugal  he writes that portuguese merchandise flowing in is what is fueling the trade in africans  he requests the king of portugal to stop sending merchandise but should only send missionaries  in one of his letters he writes each day the traders are kidnapping our people—children of this country  sons of our nobles and vassals  even people of our own family  this corruption and depravity are so widespread that our land is entirely depopulated  we need in this kingdom only priests and schoolteachers  and no merchandise  unless it is wine and flour for mass  it is our wish that this kingdom not be a place for the trade or transport of slaves…many of our subjects eagerly lust after portuguese merchandise that your subjects have brought into our domains  to satisfy this inordinate appetite  they seize many of our black free subjects     they sell them  after having taken these prisoners the coast  secretly or at night     as soon as the captives are in the hands of white men they are branded with a red-hot  the arrival of the portuguese  slavery had already existed in kongo  afonso believed that the slave trade should be subject to kongo law  when he suspected the portuguese of receiving illegally enslaved persons to sell  he wrote to king joão iii in 1526  imploring him to put a stop to the kings of dahomey sold war captives into transatlantic slavery  they would otherwise have been killed in a ceremony known as the annual customs  as one of west africa s principal slave states  dahomey became extremely unpopular with neighbouring like the bambara empire to the east  the khasso kingdoms depended heavily on the slave trade for their economy  a family s status was indicated by the number of slaves it owned  leading to wars for the sole purpose of taking more captives  this trade led the khasso into increasing contact with the european settlements of africa s west coast  particularly the benin grew increasingly rich during the 16th  and 17th  centuries on the slave trade with europe  slaves from enemy states of the interior were sold and carried to the americas in dutch and portuguese ships  the bight of benin s shore soon came to be known as the  slave gezo of dahomey said in the 1840s:the  slave trade is the ruling principle of my people  it is the source and the glory of their wealth   the mother lulls the child to sleep with notes of triumph over an enemy reduced to 1807,  the uk parliament passed the bill that abolished the trading of slaves  the king of bonny  now in nigeria  was horrified at the conclusion of the practice we think this trade must go on  that is the verdict of our oracle and the priests  they say that your country  however great  can never stop a trade ordained by god being marched to the coast for sale  enslaved people were held in large forts called factories  the amount of time in factories varied  but milton meltzer states in slavery  a world history that around 4.5%  of deaths attributed to the transatlantic slave trade occurred during this in other words  over 820,000  people are believed to have died in african ports such as benguela  elmina  and bonny  reducing the number of those shipped to 17.5  being captured and held in the factories  slaves entered the infamous middle passage  meltzer s research puts this phase of the slave trade s overall mortality at their deaths were the result of brutal treatment and poor care from the time of their capture and throughout their around 2.2  million africans died during these voyages where they were packed into tight  unsanitary spaces on ships for months at a time  measures were taken to stem the onboard mortality rate  such as enforced  dancing   as exercise  above deck and the practice of force-feeding  enslaved persons who tried to starve the conditions on board also resulted in the spread of fatal diseases  other fatalities were suicides  slaves who escaped by jumping the slave traders would try to fit anywhere from 350  to 600  slaves on one ship  before the african slave trade was completely banned by participating nations in 1853,  15.3  million enslaved people had arrived in the americas raymond l  cohn  an economics professor whose research has focused on economic history and international has researched the mortality rates among africans during the voyages of the atlantic slave trade  he found that mortality rates decreased over the history of the slave trade  primarily because the length of time necessary for the voyage was declining   in the eighteenth century many slave voyages took at least 2½  months  in the nineteenth century  2  months appears to have been the maximum length of the voyage  and many voyages were far shorter  fewer slaves died in the middle passage over time mainly because the passage was the vast profits of slavery  the ordinary sailors on slave ships were badly paid and subject to harsh discipline  mortality of around 20%  was expected in a ship s crew during the course of a voyage  this was due to disease  flogging  overwork or slave disease  malaria or yellow fever  was the most common cause of death among sailors  a high crew mortality rate on the return voyage was in the captain s interests as it reduced the number of sailors who had to be paid on reaching the home slave trade was hated by many sailors and those who joined the crews of slave ships often did so through coercion or because they could find no other also states that 33%  of africans would have died in the first year at the seasoning camps found throughout the jamaica held one of the most notorious of these camps  dysentery was the leading cause of around 5  million africans died in these camps  reducing the number of survivors to about 10  trade of enslaved africans in the atlantic has its origins in the explorations of portuguese mariners down the coast of west africa in the 15th  century  before that  contact with african slave markets was made to ransom portuguese who had been captured by the intense north african barbary pirate attacks on portuguese ships and coastal villages  frequently leaving them the first europeans to use enslaved africans in the new world were the spaniards  who sought auxiliaries for their conquest expeditions and labourers on islands such as cuba and hispaniola  the alarming decline in the native population had spurred the first royal laws protecting them  laws of burgos  1512–13).  the first enslaved africans arrived in hispaniola in after portugal had succeeded in establishing sugar plantations  engenhos  in northern brazil ca  1545,  portuguese merchants on the west african coast began to supply enslaved africans to the sugar planters  while at first these planters had relied almost exclusively on the native tupani for slave labour  after 1570  they began importing africans  as a series of epidemics had decimated the already destabilized tupani communities  by 1630,  africans had replaced the tupani as the largest contingent of labour on brazilian sugar plantations  this ended the european medieval household tradition of slavery  resulted in brazil s receiving the most enslaved africans  and revealed sugar cultivation and processing as the reason that roughly 84%  of these africans were shipped to the new world as britain rose in naval power and settled continental north america and some islands of the west indies  they became the leading slave at one stage the trade was the monopoly of the royal africa company  operating out of london  but  following the loss of the company s monopoly in bristol and liverpool merchants became increasingly involved in the by the late 17th  century  one out of every four ships that left liverpool harbour was a slave trading much of the wealth on which the city of manchester  and surrounding towns  was built in the late 18th  century  and for much of the 19th  century  was based on the processing of slave-picked  cotton and manufacture of other british cities also profited from the slave trade  birmingham  the largest gun-producing  town in britain at the time  supplied guns to be traded for 75%  of all sugar produced in the plantations was sent to london  and much of it was consumed in the highly lucrative coffee houses first slaves to arrive as part of a labour force in the new world reached the island of hispaniola  now haiti and the dominican republic  in 1502.  cuba received its first four slaves in 1513.  jamaica received its first shipment of 4000  slaves in slave exports to honduras and guatemala started in 1526.the  first enslaved africans to reach what would become the united states arrived in needed  1526  as part of a spanish attempt to colonize san miguel de gualdape  by november the 300  spanish colonists were reduced to 100,  and their slaves from 100  to the enslaved people revolted in 1526  and joined a nearby native american tribe  while the spanish abandoned the colony altogether (1527).  the area of the future colombia received its first enslaved people in 1533.  el salvador  costa rica and florida began their stints in the slave trade in 1541,  1563  and 1581,  respectively the 17th  century saw an increase in shipments  africans arrived in the english colony of jamestown  virginia in 1619.  the first kidnapped africans in english north america were classed as indentured servants and freed after seven years  virginia law codified chattel slavery in 1656,  and in 1662  the colony adopted the principle of partus sequitur ventrem  which classified children of slave mothers as slaves  regardless of paternity  irish immigrants took slaves to montserrat in 1651,  and in 1655  slaves were whom   to belize by 1802,  russian colonists noted that  boston  (u.s.-based)  skippers were trading african slaves for otter pelts with the tlingit people in southeast number of the africans who arrived in each region is calculated from the total number of slaves imported  about france in the 18th  century  returns for investors in plantations averaged around 6%;  as compared to 5%  for most domestic alternatives  this represented a 20%  profit advantage  risks—maritime and commercial—were important for individual voyages  investors mitigated it by buying small shares of many ships at the same time  in that way  they were able to diversify a large part of the risk away  between voyages  ship shares could be freely sold and far the most financially profitable west indian colonies in 1800  belonged to the united kingdom  after entering the sugar colony business late  british naval supremacy and control over key islands such as jamaica  trinidad  the leeward islands and barbados and the territory of british guiana gave it an important edge over all competitors  while many british did not make gains  a handful of individuals made small fortunes  this advantage was reinforced when france lost its most important colony  st  domingue  western hispaniola  now haiti   to a slave revolt in and supported revolts against its rival britain  after the 1793  french revolution in the name of liberty  before 1791,  british sugar had to be protected to compete against cheaper french sugar after 1791,  the british islands produced the most sugar  and the british people quickly became the largest consumers  west indian sugar became ubiquitous as an additive to indian tea  it has been estimated that the profits of the slave trade and of west indian plantations created up to one-in-twenty  of every pound circulating in the british economy at the time of the industrial revolution in the latter half of the 18th  walter rodney has argued that at the start of the slave trade in the 16th  century  although there was a technological gap between europe and africa  it was not very substantial  both continents were using iron age technology  the major advantage that europe had was in ship building  during the period of slavery  the populations of europe and the americas grew exponentially  while the population of africa remained stagnant  rodney contended that the profits from slavery were used to fund economic growth and technological advancement in europe and the americas  based on earlier theories by eric williams  he asserted that the industrial revolution was at least in part funded by agricultural profits from the americas  he cited examples such as the invention of the steam engine by james watt  which was funded by plantation owners from the historians have attacked both rodney s methodology and accuracy  joseph c  miller has argued that the social change and demographic stagnation  which he researched on the example of west central africa  was caused primarily by domestic factors  joseph inikori provided a new line of argument  estimating counterfactual demographic developments in case the atlantic slave trade had not existed  patrick manning has shown that the slave trade did have a profound impact on african demographics and social institutions  but criticized inikori s approach for not taking other factors  such as famine and drought  into account  and thus being highly scholars dispute the harm done to the enslaved people but the effect of the trade on african societies is much debated  due to the apparent influx of goods to africans  proponents of the slave trade  such as archibald dalzel  argued that african societies were robust and not much affected by the trade  in the 19th  century  european abolitionists  most prominently dr  david livingstone  took the opposite view  arguing that the fragile local economy and societies were being severely harmed by the trade because the negative effects of slavery on the economies of africa have been well documented  namely the significant decline in population  some african rulers likely saw an economic benefit from trading their subjects with european slave traders  with the exception of portuguese controlled angola  coastal african leaders  generally controlled access to their coasts  and were able to prevent direct enslavement of their subjects and thus  as african scholar john thornton argues  african leaders who allowed the continuation of the slave trade likely derived an economic benefit from selling their subjects to europeans  the kingdom of benin  for instance  participated in the african slave trade  at will  from 1715  to 1735,  surprising dutch traders  who had not expected to buy slaves in the benefit derived from trading slaves for european goods was enough to make the kingdom of benin rejoin the trans-atlantic  slave trade after centuries of non-participation.  such benefits included military technology  specifically guns and gunpowder   gold  or simply maintaining amicable trade relationships with european nations  the slave trade was  therefore  a means for some african elites to gain economic historian walter rodney estimates that by c.1770,  the king of dahomey was earning an estimated £250,000  per year by selling captive african soldiers and enslaved people to the european slave-traders.  many west african countries also already had a tradition of holding slaves  which was expanded into trade with europeans the atlantic trade brought new crops to africa and also more efficient currencies which were adopted by the west african merchants  this can be interpreted as an institutional reform which reduced the cost of doing business  but the developmental benefits were limited as long as the business including thornton and fage contend that while african political elite may have ultimately benefited from the slave trade  their decision to participate may have been influenced more by what they could lose by not participating  in fage s article  slavery and the slave trade in the context of west african history   he notes that for west africans      there were really few effective means of mobilizing labour for the economic and political needs of the state  without the slave eric williams in 1944  argued that the profits that britain received from its sugar colonies  or from the slave trade between africa and the caribbean  was a major factor in financing britain s industrial revolution  however  he says that by the time of its abolition in 1833  it had lost its profitability and it was in britain s economic interest to ban researchers and historians have strongly contested what has come to be referred to as the “williams thesis” in academia  david richardson has concluded that the profits from the slave trade amounted to less than 1%  of domestic investment in economic historian stanley engerman finds that even without subtracting the associated costs of the slave trade  e g   shipping costs  slave mortality  mortality of british people in africa  defense costs  or reinvestment of profits back into the slave trade  the total profits from the slave trade and of west indian plantations amounted to less than 5%  of the british economy during any year of the industrial engerman s 5%  figure gives as much as possible in terms of benefit of the doubt to the williams argument  not solely because it does not take into account the associated costs of the slave trade to britain  but also because it carries the full-employment  assumption from economics and holds the gross value of slave trade profits as a direct contribution to britain s national historian richard pares  in an article written before williams  book  dismisses the influence of wealth generated from the west indian plantations upon the financing of the industrial revolution  stating that whatever substantial flow of investment from west indian profits into industry there occurred after emancipation  not drescher and robert anstey argue the slave trade remained profitable until the end  and that moralistic reform  not economic incentive  was primarily responsible for abolition  they say slavery remained profitable in the 1830s  because of innovations in marx in his influential economic history of capitalism das kapital wrote that     the turning of africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins,  signaled the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production   he argued that the slave trade was part of what he termed the  primitive accumulation  of capital  the 'non-capitalist'  accumulation of wealth that preceded and created the financial conditions for britain s demographic effects of the slave trade is a controversial and highly debated issue walter rodney argued that the export of so many people had been a demographic disaster which left africa permanently disadvantaged when compared to other parts of the world  and it largely explains the continent s continued he presented numbers showing that africa s population stagnated during this period  while those of europe and asia grew dramatically  according to rodney  all other areas of the economy were disrupted by the slave trade as the top merchants abandoned traditional industries in order to pursue slaving  and the lower levels of the population were disrupted by the slaving itself others have challenged this view  j  d  fage compared the demographic effect on the continent as a whole  david eltis has compared the numbers to the rate of emigration from europe during this period  in the 19th  century alone over 50  million people left europe for the americas  a far higher rate than were ever taken from scholars accused walter rodney of mischaracterizing the trade between africans and europeans  they argue that africans  or more accurately african elites  deliberately let european traders join in an already large trade in enslaved people and that they were not joseph e  inikori argues  the history of the region shows that the effects were still quite deleterious  he argues that the african economic model of the period was very different from the european model  and could not sustain such population losses  population reductions in certain areas also led to widespread problems  inikori also notes that after the suppression of the slave trade africa s population almost immediately began to rapidly increase  even prior to the introduction of modern rodney states   the role of slavery in promoting racist prejudice and ideology has been carefully studied in certain situations  especially in the usa  the simple fact is that no people can enslave another for four centuries without coming out with a notion of superiority  and when the colour and other physical traits of those peoples were quite different it was inevitable that the prejudice should take a racist williams argued that  a racial twist given to what is basically an economic phenomenon  slavery was not born of racism  rather  racism was the consequence of britain  america  portugal and in parts of europe  opposition developed against the slave trade  davis says that abolitionists assumed  that an end to slave imports would lead automatically to the amelioration and gradual abolition of in britain and america  opposition to the trade was led by the religious society of friends  quakers  and establishment evangelicals such as william wilberforce  many people joined the movement and they began to protest against the trade  but they were opposed by the owners of the colonial following lord mansfield s decision in 1772,  slaves became free upon entering the british under the leadership of thomas jefferson  the new state of virginia in 1778  became the first state and one of the first jurisdictions anywhere to stop the importation of slaves for sale  it made it a crime for traders to bring in slaves from out of state or from overseas for sale  migrants from other states were allowed to bring their own slaves  the new law freed all slaves brought in illegally after its passage and imposed heavy fines on denmark  which had been active in the slave trade  was the first country to ban the trade through legislation in 1792,  which took effect in 1803.  britain banned the slave trade in 1807,  imposing stiff fines for any slave found aboard a british ship  see slave trade act 1807).  the royal navy moved to stop other nations from continuing the slave trade and declared that slaving was equal to piracy and was punishable by death  the united states congress passed the slave trade act of 1794,  which prohibited the building or outfitting of ships in the u s  for use in the slave trade  in 1807  congress outlawed the importation of slaves beginning on 1  january 1808,  the earliest date permitted by the united states constitution for such a ban william wilberforce was a driving force in the british parliament in the fight against the slave trade in the british empire  on 22  february 1807,  the house of commons passed a motion 283  votes to 16  to abolish the atlantic slave trade  the united states abolished the slave trade the same year  but not its internal slave trade which became the dominant character in american slavery until the in 1805  the british order-in-council  had restricted the importation of slaves into colonies that had been captured from france and the britain continued to press other nations to end its trade  in 1810  an anglo-portuguese  treaty was signed whereby portugal agreed to restrict its trade into its colonies  an 1813  anglo-swedish  treaty whereby sweden outlawed its slave trade  the treaty of paris 1814  where france agreed with britain that the trade is  repugnant to the principles of natural justice  and agreed to abolish the slave trade in five years  the 1814  anglo-netherlands  treaty where the dutch outlawed its slave royal navy s west africa squadron  established in 1808,  grew by 1850  to a force of some 25  vessels  which were tasked with combating slavery along the african between 1807  and 1860,  the royal navy s squadron seized approximately 1,600  ships involved in the slave trade and freed 150,000  africans who were aboard these several hundred slaves a year were transported by the navy to the british colony of sierra leone  where they were made to serve as  apprentices  in the colonial economy until the slavery abolition act last recorded slave ship to land on u s  soil was the clotilde  which in 1859  illegally smuggled a number of africans into the town of mobile  the africans on board were sold as slaves  however  slavery in the u s  was abolished five years later following the end of the american civil war in 1865.  the last survivor of the voyage was cudjoe lewis  who died in the last country to ban the atlantic slave trade was brazil in 1831.  however  a vibrant illegal trade continued to ship large numbers of enslaved people to brazil and also to cuba until the 1860s,  when british enforcement and further diplomacy finally ended the atlantic slave trade  in 1870  portugal ended the last trade route with the americas where the last country to import slaves was brazil  in brazil  however  slavery itself was not ended until 1888,  making it the last country in the americas to end involuntary servitude the historian walter rodney contends that it was a decline in the profitability of the triangular trades that made it possible for certain basic human sentiments to be asserted at the decision-making  level in a number of european countries-  britain being the most crucial because it was the greatest carrier of african captives across the atlantic  rodney states that changes in productivity  technology  and patterns of exchange in europe and the americas informed the decision by the british to end their participation in the trade in 1807.  in 1809  president james madison outlawed the slave trade with the united states nevertheless  michael hardt and antonio argue that it was neither a strictly economic nor moral matter  first  because slavery was  in practice  still beneficial to capitalism  providing not only an influx of capital but also disciplining hardship into workers  a form of  apprenticeship  to the capitalist industrial plant   the more  recent  argument of a  moral shift   the basis of the previous lines of this article  is described by hardt and negri as an  ideological  apparatus in order to eliminate the sentiment of guilt in western society  although moral arguments did play a secondary role  they usually had major resonance when used as a strategy to undercut competitors  profits  this argument holds that eurocentric history has been blind to the most important element in this fight for emancipation  precisely  the constant revolt and the antagonism of slaves  revolts  the most important of those being the haitian revolution  the shock of this revolution in 1804,  certainly introduces an essential political argument into the end of the slave trade  which happened only three years later the african diaspora which was created via slavery has been a complex interwoven part of american history and in the united states  the success of alex haley s book roots  the saga of an american family  published in 1976,  and the subsequent television miniseries based upon it roots  broadcast on the abc network in january 1977,  led to an increased interest and appreciation of african heritage amongst the african-american  the influence of these led many african americans to begin researching their family histories and making visits to west africa  in turn  a tourist industry grew up to supply them  one notable example of this is through the roots homecoming festival held annually in the gambia  in which rituals are held through which african americans can symbolically  come home  to issues of dispute have however developed between african americans and african authorities over how to display historic sites that were involved in the atlantic slave trade  with prominent voices in the former criticising the latter for not displaying such sites sensitively  but instead treating them as a commercial 1816,  a group of wealthy european-americans,  some of whom were abolitionists and others who were racial segregationists  founded the american colonization society with the express desire of returning african americans who were in the united states to west africa  in 1820,  they sent their first ship to liberia  and within a decade around two thousand african americans had been settled in the west african country  such re-settlement  continued throughout the 19th  century  increasing following the deterioration of race relations in the southern states of the us following reconstruction in rastafari movement  which originated in jamaica  where 98%  of the population are descended from victims of the atlantic slave trade  has made great efforts to publicize the slavery and to ensure it is not forgotten  especially through reggae 1998,  unesco designated 23  august as international day for the remembrance of the slave trade and its abolition  since then there have been a number of events recognizing the effects of slavery at the 2001  world conference against racism in durban  south africa  african nations demanded a clear apology for slavery from the former slave-trading  countries  some nations were ready to express an apology  but the opposition  mainly from the united kingdom  portugal  spain  the netherlands  and the united states blocked attempts to do so  a fear of monetary compensation might have been one of the reasons for the opposition  as of 2009,  efforts are underway to create a un slavery memorial as a permanent remembrance of the victims of the atlantic slave trade in 1999,  president mathieu kerekou of benin  formerly the kingdom of dahomey  issued a national apology for the role africans played in the atlantic slave luc gnacadja  minister of environment and housing for

chirac  the then french president  said that 10  may would henceforth be a national day of remembrance for the victims of slavery in france  marking the day in 2001  when france passed a law

african chieftains who participated in trade calling for an apology for their role in the atlantic slave trade   we cannot continue to blame the white men  as africans  particularly the traditional rulers  are not blameless  in view of the fact that the americans and europe have accepted the cruelty of their roles and have forcefully apologized  it would be logical  reasonable and humbling if african traditional rulers     accept blame and formally apologize to the descendants of the victims of their collaborative and exploitative slave 1998,  president yoweri museveni of uganda called tribal chieftains to apologize for their involvement in the slave trade   african chiefs were the ones waging war on each other and capturing their own people and selling them  if anyone should apologise it should be the african chiefs  we still have those traitors here even 9  december 1999,  liverpool city council passed a formal motion apologizing for the city s part in the slave trade

24  august 2007,  ken livingstone  mayor of london  apologized publicly for london s role in the slave trade   you can look across there to see the institutions that still have the benefit of the
