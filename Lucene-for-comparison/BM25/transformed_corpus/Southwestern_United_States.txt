 southwestern united states -  wikipediathe southwestern united states  also known as the american southwest  is the informal name for a region of the western united states  definitions vary a great deal and have never been standardized--and  many have been proposed  for example  it might include the stretch from east of los angeles to el paso  and from the mexican border to south of denver  the population for that particular definition area is around 11  million people  with over half that in the state of arizona  the largest metropolitan areas are phoenix  with a population over 4  million people  and las vegas  about 2  million   other significant population centers in the southwest are albuquerque  el paso  and tucson most of the area was part of the viceroyalty of new spain in the spanish empire before becoming part of mexico  european settlement was almost non-existent  outside new mexico in 1848,  when it became part of the united states through the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo  far southern arizona was added in the later gadsden purchase its just the population history the geography of the region is mainly made up by four features  the mojave  sonoran  and chihuahuan deserts  and the colorado plateau  although there are other geographical features as well  such as a portion of the great basin desert  the deserts dominate the southern and western reaches of the area  while the plateau  which is largely made up of high desert  is the main feature north of the mogollon the two major rivers of the region are the colorado river  running in the northern and western areas  and the rio grande  running in the east  north to south formed approximately 8000  years ago  the chihuahuan desert is a relatively dry although it is slightly wetter than the sonoran desert to the the chihuahuan desert spreads across the southeastern portion of the region  covering from southeastern arizona  across southern new mexico  and the portion of texas included in the while it is the second largest desert in the united only a third of the desert is within the united states  with the rest in el paso is the major city in this desert  with other smaller cities being las cruces and roswell in new elevation in the chihuahuan varies from 1970  to 5500  feet  as there are several smaller mountain ranges contained in the area  namely the san andres and doña anas in new mexico  and the franklin mountains  which span texas and new mexico in the southwest region  the chihuahuan is a  rain shadow  desert  formed between two mountain ranges  the sierra madre occidental on the west and the sierra madre oriental on the east  which block oceanic precipitation from reaching the the chihuahuan desert is considered the  most biologically diverse desert in the western hemisphere and one of the most diverse in the world   and includes more species of cacti than any other desert in the the most prolific plants in this region are agave  yucca and creosote in addition to the ubiquitous cacti when people think of the desert southwest  the landscape of the sonoran desert is what mostly comes to the sonoran desert makes up the southwestern portion of the southwest  most of the desert lies in mexico  but its united states component lies on the southeastern border of california  and the western 2/3  of southern arizona  rainfall averages between 4–12  inches per year  and the desert s most widely known inhabitant is the saguaro cactus  which is unique to the it is bounded on the northwest by the mojave desert  to the north by the colorado plateau and to the east by the arizona mountains forests and the chihuahuan aside from the trademark saguaro  the desert has the most diverse plant life of any desert in the and includes many other species of cacti  including the organ-pipe,  senita  prickly pear  barrel  fishhook  hedgehog  cholla  silver dollar  and the portion of the sonora desert which lies in the southwestern united states is the most populated area within the region  six of the top ten major population centers of the region are found within its borders  phoenix  tucson  mesa  chandler  glendale  and scottsdale  all in arizona  also within its borders are yuma and prescott most northwest portion of the american southwest is covered by the mojave desert  bordered on the south by the sonoran desert and the east by the colorado plateau  its range within the region makes up the southeast tip of nevada  and the northwestern corner of in terms of topography  the mojave is very similar to the great basin desert  which lies just to its within the region  las vegas is the most populous city  other significant areas of human habitation include laughlin and pahrump in nevada  and lake havasu city  kingman  and bullhead city in arizona  the mojave is the smallest  driest and hottest desert within the united the mojave gets less than six inches of rain annually  and its elevation ranges from 3000  to 6000  feet above sea the most prolific vegetation is the tall joshua tree  which grow as tall as 40  feet  and are thought to live almost 1000  other major vegetation includes the parry saltbush and the mojave sage  both only found in the mojave  as well as the creosote colorado plateau varies from the large stands of forests in the west  including the largest stand of ponderosa pine trees in the world  to the mesas to the although not called a desert  the colorado plateau is mostly made up of high desert  within the southwest u s  region  the colorado is bordered to the south by the mogollon rim and the sonoran desert  to the west by the mojave desert  and to the east by the rocky mountains and the llano the plateau is characterized by a series of plateaus and mesas  interspersed with the most dramatic example is the grand but that is one of many dramatic vistas included within the plateau  which includes spectacular lava formations   painted  deserts  sand dunes  and one of the most distinctive features of the plateau is its longevity  having come into existence at least 500  million years the plateau can be divided into six sections  three of which fall into the southwest region  beginning with the navaho section forming the northern boundary of the southwestern united states  which has shallower canyons than those in the canyonlands section just to its north  the navaho section is bordered to the south by the grand canyon section  which of course is dominated by the grand canyon  and the southeastern-most  portion of the plateau is the datil section  consisting of valleys  mesas  and volcanic albuquerque is the most populous city within the portion contained in the southwest region  but sante fe  new mexico and flagstaff  arizona  are also significant population centers geographer d  w  meinig defines the southwest in a very similar fashion to reed  the portion of new mexico west of the llano estacado and the portion of arizona east of the mojave-sonoran  desert and south of the  canyon lands  and also including the el paso district of western texas and the southernmost part of meinig breaks the southwest down into four distinct subregions  he calls the first subregion  northern new mexico   and describes it as focused on albuquerque and santa fe  it extends from the san luis valley of southern colorado to south of socorro and including the manzano mountains  with an east-west  breadth in the north stretching from the upper canadian river to the upper san juan river  the area around albuquerque is sometimes called central new mexico  central arizona  is a vast metropolitan area spread across one contiguous sprawling oasis  essentially equivalent to the phoenix metropolitan area  the city of phoenix is the largest urban center  and located in the approximate center of the area that includes tempe  mesa  and many calls the third subregion  el paso  tucson  and the southern borderlands   while el paso and tucson are distinctly different cities  they serve as anchor points to the hinterland between them  tucson occupies a large oasis at the western end of the el paso-tucson  corridor  the region between the two cities is a major transportation trunk with settlements servicing both highway and railway needs  there are also large mining operations  ranches  and agricultural oases  both el paso and tucson have large military installations nearby  fort bliss and white sands missile range north of el paso in new mexico  and  near tucson  the davis-monthan  air force base  about 70  miles (110  km  to the southeast are the research facilities at fort huachuca  these military installations form a kind of hinterland around the el paso-tucson  region  and are served by scientific and residential communities such as sierra vista  las cruces  and alamogordo  el paso s influence extends north into the mesilla valley  and southeast along the rio grande into the trans-pecos  region of fourth subregion meinig calls the  northern corridor and navaholands   a major highway and railway trunk which connects albuquerque and flagstaff  just north of the transportation trunk are large blocks of american indian tucson  and las vegas dominate the westernmost metropolitan areas in the southwest  while albuquerque  and el paso dominate the easternmost metropolitan history in the southwest begins with the arrival of the clovis culture  a paleo-indian  hunter-gatherer  culture which arrived sometime around 9000  this culture remained in the area for several millennia  at some point they were replaced by three great pre-columbian  indian cultures  the ancestral pueblo people  the hohokam  and the mogollon  all of which existed among other surrounding cultures including the fremont and maize began to be cultivated in the region sometime during the early first millennium bc  but it took several hundred years for the native cultures to be dependent on it as a food as their dependence on maize grew  pre-columbian  indians began developing irrigation systems around to archeological finds  the ancestral pueblo people  also known as the anasazi  although that term is becoming more and more disused   began settling in the area in approximately 1500  eventually  they would spread throughout the entire northern section of the this culture would go through several different eras lasting from approximately 1500  bc through the middle of the 15th  century ad  the basketmaker i  ii  and iii phases followed by the pueblo i  ii  iii  and iv  as the puebloans transitioned from a nomadic lifestyle to one based on agriculture  their first domiciles were the mogollon culture developed later than the puebloan  arising in the eastern area of the region at around 300  their range would eventually extend deep into what would become mexico  and dominate the southeastern portion of the their settlements would evolve over time from pit-dwellings  through pueblos and finally also incorporating cliff-dwellings.  the hohokam were the last of these ancestral cultures to develop  somewhere around 1  ad  but they would grow to be the most populous of the three by 1300  ad  despite being the smallest of the three in terms of area  covering most of the southwest beginning in approximately 600  ad  the hohokam began to develop an extensive series of irrigation of the three major cultures in the southwest  only the hohokam developed irrigation as a means of watering their long after the hohokam reached the height of their culture  all three major cultures in the southwest began to decline  for unknown reasons  although severe drought and encroachment from other peoples has been postulated  by the end of the 15th  century  all three cultures had disappeared  the modern indian tribes of the hopi  zuni  acoma  and laguna trace their ancestry back to the ancestral while the akimel o odham and tohono o odham claim descent from the area previously occupied by the mogollon was taken over by an unrelated tribe  the while it is unclear whether any of the modern indian tribes are descended from the mogollon  some archeologists and historians believe that they mixed with ancestral puebloans and became part of the hopi and to the arrival of europeans  the southwestern united states was inhabited by a very large population of american indian tribes  the area once occupied by the ancestral puebloans became inhabited by several american indian tribes  the most populous of which were the navajo  ute  southern paiute  and hopi  the navajo  along with the hopi  were the earliest of the modern indian tribes to develop in the southwest  around 1100  ad their culture began to develop in the four corners area of the the ute were found over most of modern-day  utah and colorado  as well as northern new mexico and the paiutes roamed an area which covered over 45,000  square miles of southern nevada and california  south-central  utah  and northern the hopi settled the lands of the central and western portions of northern arizona  their village of oraibi  settled in approximately 1100  ad  is one of the oldest continuously occupied settlements in the united the mogollon area became occupied by the apaches and the zuni  the apache migrated into the american southwest from the northern areas of north america at some point between 1200  and they settled throughout new mexico  eastern arizona  northern mexico  parts of western texas  and southern the zuni count their direct ancestry through the ancestral puebloans  the modern day zuni established a culture along the zuni river in far-eastern  arizona and western new both major tribes of the o odham tribe settled in the southern and central arizona  in the lands once controlled by their ancestors  the first european intrusion into the region came from the south  in 1539,  a jesuit franciscan named marcos de niza led an expedition from mexico city which passed through eastern the following year francisco vázquez de coronado  based on reports from survivors of the narváez expedition (1528–36)  who had crossed eastern texas on their way to mexico city  led an expedition to discover the seven golden cities of the 1582-3  expedition of antonio de espejo explored new mexico and eastern and this led to juan de oñate s establishment of the spanish province of santa fe de nuevo méxico in 1598,  with a capital founded near ohkay oweenge pueblo  which he called san juan de los oñate s party also attempted to establish a settlement in arizona in 1599,  but were turned back by inclement in 1610,  santa fe was founded  making it the oldest capital in united 1664  juan archuleta led an expedition into what is now colorado  becoming the first european to enter  a second spanish expedition was led into colorado by juan ulibarrí in during which he claimed the colorado territory for 1687  to 1691  the jesuit priest  eusebio kino established several missions in the santa cruz river and kino further explored southern and central arizona in 1694,  during which he discovered the ruins of casa beginning in 1732,  spanish settlers began to enter the region  and the spanish started bestowing land grants in mexico and the southwest in 1751,  the o odham rebelled against the spanish incursions  but the revolt was unsuccessful  in fact  it had the exact opposite effect  for the result of the rebellion was the establishment of the presidio at tubac  the first permanent european settlement in 1768,  the spanish created the provincia de las californias  which included california and the southwest us  over approximately the next 50  years  the spanish continued to explore the southwest  and in 1776  the city of tucson was founded when the presidio san augustin del tucson was created  relocating the presidio from 1776,  two franciscan priest  francisco atanasio domínguez and silvestre vélez de escalante  led an expedition from santa fe heading to california  after passing through colorado  they became the first europeans to travel into what is now utah  their journey was halted by bad weather in october  and they turned back  heading south into arizona before turning east back to santa 1804  spain divided the provincia de las californias  creating the province alta california  which consisted primarily of what would become california  nevada  arizona  colorado  utah and new mexico  in 1821  mexico achieved its independence from spain and shortly after  in 1824,  developed its constitution  which established the alta california territory  which was the same geographic area as the earlier spanish province in 1825,  arizona was visited by its first non-spanish  europeans  english in 1836,  the republic of texas  which contained the easternmost of the southwest united states  won its independence from mexico  in 1845  the republic of texas was annexed by the united states  and immediately became a state  bypassing the usual territory phase  the new state still contained portions of what would eventually become parts of other in 1846,  the southwest became embroiled in the mexican–american war  partly as a result of the united states  annexation of texas  on august 18,  1846,  an american force captured santa fe  new on december 16  of the same year  american forces captured tucson  arizona  marking the end of hostilities in the southwest united when the war ended with the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo on february 2,  1848,  the united states gained control of all of present-day  california  nevada and utah  as well as the majority of arizona  and parts of new mexico and colorado  the rest of present-day  colorado  and most of new mexico had been gained by the united states in their annexation of the republic of the final portion of the southwestern united states came about through the acquisition of the southernmost parts of arizona and new mexico through the gadsden purchase in 1851,  san luis became the first european settlement in what is now the states of which at least a portion make up the southwest  texas was the first to achieve statehood  on december 29,  1846  the republic of texas was annexed  bypassing becoming a territory  and immediately becoming a initially  its borders included parts of what would become several other states  almost half of new mexico  a third of colorado  and small portions of kansas  oklahoma  and texas current borders were set in the compromise of 1850,  where texas ceded land to the federal government in exchange for $10  million  which would go to paying off the debt texas had accumulated in its war with the mexican cession  the lands of what had been the mexican territory of alta california were in flux  portions of what is now new mexico were claimed  but never controlled  by texas  with the compromise of 1850,  the states of texas and california were created  texas as a slave state  and california as a free state   as well as the utah territory and new mexico the new mexico territory consisted of most of arizona and new mexico  excluding a strip along their southern borders   a small section of southern colorado  and the very southern tip of while the utah territory consisted of utah  most of nevada  and portions of wyoming and the new mexico territory was expanded along its southern extent  to its current border  with the signing of the gadsden purchase treaty on december 30,  which was ratified by the u s  congress  with some slight alterations  in april colorado territory was organized on february 28,  1861,  created out of lands then currently in the utah  kansas  nebraska  and new mexico the nevada territory was also organized in 1861,  on march 2,  with land taken from the existing utah territory  initially  only the western 2/3  of what is currently the state of nevada was included in the territory  with its boundary to the east being the 116th  meridian  and to the south the 37th  in 1862  nevada s eastern border shifted to the 115th  meridian  and finally to its current position at the 114th  meridian in 1866.  the boundary modification in 1866  also included adding the southern triangular tip of the present-day  state  taken from the arizona july 24–27,  1861  a confederate force under the command of lt  colonel john robert baylor forced the surrender of the small union garrison stationed at fort fillmore  near mesilla  new mexico  on august 1,  1861,  baylor declared the creation of the arizona territory  and claimed it for the confederacy  with mesilla as its the territory  which had been formed by the portion of the existing new mexico territory below the 34th  parallel  became official on february 14,  february 24,  1863,  the new mexico territory was split virtually in half with the creation of the arizona territory taking the western was admitted to the union on october 31,  1864,  becoming the 36th  this was followed by the admittance to the union of colorado  which became the 38th  state on august 1,  confederate arizona was short-lived,  however  by may 1862  confederate forces had been driven out of the region by union troops  that same month a bill was introduced into the u s  congress  and in february 24,  1863  abraham lincoln signed the arizona organic act  which officially created the u s  territory of arizona  splitting the new mexico territory at the 107th  as shown above  evolved out of the utah territory  as pieces of the original territory created in 1850  were carved out  parts were ceded to nevada  wyoming  and colorado in 1861;  another section to nevada in 1862;  and the final section to nevada in in 1890,  the lds church issued the 1890  manifesto  which officially banned polygamy for members of the it was the last roadblock for utah entering the union  and on january 4,  1896  utah was officially granted statehood  becoming the 45th  1869,  john wesley powell led a 3-month  expedition which explored the grand canyon and the colorado in 1875,  he would publish a book describing his explorations  report of the exploration of the columbia river of the west and its tributaries  which was later republished as the exploration of the colorado river and its canyons in 1877  silver was discovered in southeastern arizona  the notorious mining town of tombstone  arizona was born to service the the town would become immortalized as the scene of what is considered the greatest gunfight in the history of the old west  the gunfight at the o k  was also discovered in 1877,  near bisbee and jerome in arizona  which became an important component of the economy of the southwest  production began in 1880,  and was made more profitable by the expansion of the railroad throughout the territory during the early 1880s  also saw the completion of the second transcontinental railroad  which ran through the heart of the southwest  called the  sante fe route   it ran from chicago  down through topeka  then further south to albuquerque  before heading almost due west through northern arizona to los repeal of the sherman silver purchase act in 1893  led to the decline of the silver mining industry in the 1901,  the santa fe railroad reached the south rim of the grand canyon  opening the way for a tourism a trend led by restaurant and hotel entrepreneur fred last two territories within the southwest to achieve statehood were new mexico and arizona  by 1863,  with the splitting off of the arizona territory  new mexico reached its modern borders  they became states within a month of one another  on january 6,  1912,  new mexico became the 47th  state in the arizona would shortly follow  becoming the last of the 48  contiguous united states on february 14,  early 1920s  saw the ku klux klan gain power in colorado  however  the organization lost traction and by the end of the decade they no longer exerted influence in the 1930s  saw the beginning of the ski industry in colorado  resorts were established in areas such as estes park  gunnison  and on loveland at the end of the decade  in 1939,  with the establishment of alta ski area  utah s skiing began to be to the ski conditions in the state  during wwii  the 10th

one of the largest mass shooting in u s  history  the aurora shooting  which resulted in the deaths of 12  people  with another 70  also in 2012,  colorado voters passed law legalizing the recreational use of this article deals with the core definition for the american southwest  there are many others  the various definitions can be broken down into four main categories  historical archeological  geological topographical  ecological  and cultural  in the 1930s  and 1940s,  many definitions of the southwest included all or part of texas  oklahoma  new mexico  arizona  california  colorado  and utah  as time has gone on  the definition of the southwest as become more solidified and more compact  for example  in 1948  the national geographic society defined the american southwest as all of california  nevada  utah  arizona  colorado  and new mexico  and the southernmost sections of oregon  idaho  and wyoming  as well as parts of southwest nebraska  western kansas  oklahoma  and texas  by 1977,  the society s definition had narrowed to only the four states of utah  arizona  colorado  and new mexico  and by 1982  the portion of the southwest in the united states  as defined by the society  had shrunk to arizona and new mexico  with the southernmost strip of utah and colorado  as well as the mojave and colorado deserts in other individuals who focus on southwest studies who favored a more limited extent of the area to center on arizona and new mexico  with small parts of surrounding areas  include erna fergusson  charles lummis  who claimed to have coined the term  the southwest   and cultural geographer raymond gastil  and ethnologist miguel the us expanded westward  the country s western border also shifted westward  and consequently  so did the location of the southwestern and northwestern united states  in the early years of the united states  newly colonized lands lying immediately west of the appalachian mountains were detached from north carolina and given the name southwest territory  during the decades that followed  the region known as  the southwestern united states  covered much of the deep south east of the mississippi river however  as territories and eventual states to the west were added after the mexican–american war  the geographical  southwest  expanded  and the relationship of these new acquisitions to the south itself became  increasingly archeologist  erik reed  gives a description which is the most widely accepted as defining the american southwest  which runs from durango  colorado in the north  to durango  mexico  in the south  and from las vegas  nevada in the west to las vegas  new mexico in the east  reed s definition is roughly equivalent to the western half of the learning center of the american southwest s definition  leaving out any portion of kansas and oklahoma  and much of texas  as well as the eastern half of new mexico  since this article is about the southwestern united states  the areas of sonora and chihuahua in mexico will be excluded  the portion left includes arizona and western new mexico  the very southernmost part of utah  southwestern colorado  the very tip of west texas  and triangle formed by the southern tip of nevada  this will be the defined scope which is used in this article  unless otherwise specified in a particular this perspective  almost all of the region s physiographical traits  geological formations  and weather are contained within a box between 26°  and 38°  northern latitude  and 98°  30'  and 124°  western looking at the fauna of the region  there is a broader definition of the american southwest  the southwestern center for herpetological research defines the southwest as being only the states of arizona  new mexico  with parts of california  nevada  texas  and utah  although they include all of those six states in their map of the region  solely for ease of defining the of the other states make up the various areas which can be included in the southwest  depending on the source  see figure 1).  the learning center of the american southwest does not rely on current state boundaries  and defines the american southwest as parts of arizona  colorado  kansas  new mexico  oklahoma  texas  and utah  see figure clark powell  a major bibliographer whose emphasis is on the southwest  defined the american southwest in a 1958  arizona highways article as   the lands lying west of the pecos  north of the border  south of the mesa verde and the grand canyon  and east of the mountains which wall off southern california and make it a land in has long been the focal point of this dichotomy  and is often considered  as such  the core area of  the south s while the trans-pecos  area is generally acknowledged as part of the desert most of texas and large parts of oklahoma are often placed into a sub-region  of the south  which some consider southwestern in the general framework of the original application  meaning the  western south   this is an area containing the basic elements of southern history  culture  politics  religion  and linguistic and settlement patterns  yet blended with traits of the frontier west  while this particular southwest is notably different in many ways from the classic  old south  or southeast  these features are strong enough to give it a separate southwestern identity quite different in nature from that of the interior southwestern states to the west one of these distinguishing characteristics in texas—in addition to being a confederate state during the civil war—is that indigenous and spanish american culture never played a central role in the development of this area in relative comparison to the others  as the vast majority of settlers were anglo and blacks from the although the present day state of oklahoma was indian territory until the early 20th  century  many of these american indians were from the southeastern united states and became culturally assimilated early on  the majority of members of these tribes also allied themselves with the confederacy during the civil war  combined with that  once the territory was open for settlement  southeastern pioneers made up a disproportionate number of these newcomers  all this contributed to the new state having a character that differed from other parts of the southwest with large american indian fact that a majority of residents of texas and oklahoma—unlike those in other  southwestern  states—self-identify  as living in the south and consider themselves southerners rather than the west and westerners—also lends to treating these two states as a somewhat distinct and separate entity in terms of regional of the southwest generally includes various types of yucca  along with saguaro cactus  barrel cactus  prickly pear cactus  desert spoon  creosote bush  sagebrush  and greasewood  although cacti is thought to only grow in arizona and new mexico  many native cacti grow throughout nevada  utah  colorado  and west texas  steppe is also located all over the high plains areas in colorado  new mexico  and texas  the mountains of the southwestern states have large tracts of alpine trees landscape features of the core southwestern areas include mountains  canyons  mesas  buttes  high broad basins  plateaus  desert lands  and some plains  characteristic of the basin and range province  the entire southwestern region features semi-arid  to arid terrain  the far eastern part of southwestern texas  for example the texas hill country  consists of dry  tall  and rugged rocky hills of limestone and granite  south texas and the rio grande valley is mostly flat with many places consisting of scrub and bare topsoil  much like the deserts further west the region has an extremely diverse bird population  with hundreds of species being found in the american southwest  in the chiricahua mountains alone  in southeastern arizona  there can be found more than 400  species  species include canadian  branta canadensis  and snow geese  sandhill cranes  grus and the roadrunner  the most famous bird in the region  is found in all states of the birds of
