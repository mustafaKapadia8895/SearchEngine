 project stormfury -  wikipediaproject stormfury was an attempt to weaken tropical cyclones by flying aircraft into them and seeding with silver iodide  the project was run by the united states government from 1962  to 1983.the  hypothesis was that the silver iodide would cause supercooled water in the storm to freeze  disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane  this led to the seeding of several atlantic hurricanes  however  it was later shown that this hypothesis was incorrect  it was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective  additionally  researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes  this finding called stormfury s successes into question  as the changes reported now had a natural explanation the last experimental flight was flown in 1971,  due to a lack of candidate storms and a changeover in noaa s fleet  more than a decade after the last modification experiment  project stormfury was officially canceled  although a failure in its goal of reducing the destructiveness of hurricanes  project stormfury was not without merit  the observational data and storm lifecycle research generated by stormfury helped improve meteorologists  ability to forecast the movement and intensity of future hurricanes cloud seeding was first attempted by vincent schaefer and irving langmuir  after witnessing the artificial creation of ice crystals  langmuir became an enthusiastic proponent of weather schaefer found that when he dumped crushed dry ice into a cloud  precipitation in the form of snow regard to hurricanes  it was hypothesized that by seeding the area around the eyewall with silver iodide  latent heat would be released  this would promote the formation of a new eyewall  as this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall  the winds of the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a reduced pressure even a small reduction in the speed of a hurricane s winds would be beneficial  since the damage potential of a hurricane increased as the square of the wind a slight lowering of wind speed would have a large reduction in to langmuir s efforts  and the research of schaefer at general electric  the concept of using cloud seeding to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum  indeed  schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on december 20,  1946  by seeding a this caused ge to drop out for legal reasons  schaefer and langmuir assisted the u s  military as advisors for project cirrus  the first large study of cloud physics and weather modification  its most important goal was to try to weaken cirrus was the first attempt to modify a hurricane  it was a collaboration of the general electric corporation  the us army signal corps  the office of naval research  and the us air after several preparations  and initial skepticism by government the first attempt to modify a hurricane began on october 13,  1947  on a hurricane that was heading west to east and out to airplane flew along the rainbands of the hurricane  and dropped nearly 180  pounds (82  kilograms  of crushed dry ice into the the crew reported  pronounced modification of the cloud deck it is not known if that was due to the seeding  next  the hurricane changed direction and made landfall near savannah  georgia  the public blamed the seeding  and irving langmuir claimed that the reversal had been caused by human cirrus was and lawsuits were threatened  only the fact that a system in 1906  had taken a similar path  as well as evidence showing that the storm had already begun to turn when seeding began  ended the this disaster set back the cause of seeding hurricanes for eleven years at first the seeding was officially denied and it took years before the government admitted it  according to the sept  12,  1965  edition of the fort lauderdale news and sun-sentinel,  in 1947  a hurricane  went whacky  and  twelve years later it was admitted the storm had in fact been united states weather bureau s national hurricane research project  founded in 1955,  had as one of its objectives to investigate the scientific validity of hurricane modification methods  to this end  silver iodide dispensers were tested in hurricane daisy in august 1958.  the flares were deployed outside of the hurricane eyewall  so this was an equipment test rather than a modification experiment  the equipment malfunctioned in all but one of the flights  and no conclusive data was first seeding experiment since the cirrus disaster was attempted on september 16,  1961,  into hurricane esther by nhrp and the united states navy aircraft  eight cylinders of silver iodide were dropped into esther s eyewall  and winds were recorded as weakening by 10  the next day  more seeding flights were made  this time  the silver iodide did not fall into the eyewall  and no reduction in windspeed was observed  these two results were interpreted as making the experiment a seedings into hurricane esther led to the establishment of project stormfury in 1962.  project stormfury was a joint venture of the united states department of commerce and the united states objective of project baton was the analysis of the life history of thunderstorms  a department of defense research activity supported by the advanced research project agency  project baton sought to expand understanding of storm physics as an aid to weather forecasting  fire prevention  and  possibly  for artificially controlling the weather  dr  helmut weickmann  as an employee of the u s  army signal research and development laboratory  and dr  paul mcready of meteorology research  inc   were joint leaders of the project baton the 1962  julyâ€“august storm season in flagstaff  arizona  the scientists  selected  guinea pig  storms  and seeded them with chemicals  effects were thoroughly analyzed from the ground and from the air with time-lapse  motion picture cameras  stereo still cameras  storm radar  lightning detectors  and airborne heat sensors  among the agents inserted in selected clouds were  condensation nuclei  which temporarily increased the number of water droplets in the cloud  and pulverized dry ice  which turns a portion of the cloud to fine snow crystals that remain aloft  the utilization of these agents facilitated study of a storm s simpson became its first director  serving in this capacity until there were several guidelines used in selecting which storms to seed  the hurricane had to have a less than 10  percent chance of approaching inhabited land within a it had to be within range of the seeding aircraft  and it had to be a fairly intense storm with a well-formed  the primary effect of these criteria was to make possible seeding targets extremely suitable storms formed in the 1962  season  next year  stormfury began by conducting experiments on cumulus clouds  from august 17  to 20  of that year  experiments were conducted in 11  clouds  of which six were seeded and five were controls  in five of the six seeded clouds  changes consistent with the working hypothesis were august 23,  1963,  hurricane beulah was the site of the next seeding attempt  it had an indistinct eyewall  in addition  mistakes were made  as the seedings of silver iodide were dropped in the wrong places  as a consequence  nothing the next day  another attempt was made  and the seeders hit their targets  the eyewall was observed to fall apart and be replaced by another eyewall with a larger the sustained winds also fell by twenty all in all  the results of the experiments on beulah were  encouraging but the six years after beulah  no seedings were conducted for several different reasons  in 1964,  measurement and observation equipment was not ready to be the year after that  all flights were used for additional experimentation in non-hurricane  simpson became its director beginning in while out to sea in august of the 1965  atlantic hurricane season  stormfury meteorologists decided that hurricane betsy was a good candidate for however  the storm immediately swung towards land  and on september 1,  the planned flights were canceled  for some reason  the press was not notified that there were no seedings  and several newspapers reported that it had as betsy passed close to the bahamas and smashed into southern florida  the public and congress thought that seeding was underway and blamed it took two months for stormfury officials to convince congress that betsy was not seeded  and the project was allowed to a second candidate  hurricane elena  stayed too far out to betsy  two other hurricanes came close to being seeded  hurricane faith was considered a likely candidate  but it stayed out of range of the seeding that same year  recon flights were conducted into hurricane inez  but there were no both the 1967  and 1968  seasons were inactive  because of that  there were no suitable seeding targets in either of those two r  cecil gentry became the director of stormfury in there were no more near-seedings  until 1969.  in the interim  equipment was improved  what once was the primitive method of hand-dumping  dry ice was replaced with rocket canisters loaded with silver iodide  and then gun-like  devices mounted on the wings of the airplanes that fired silver iodide into the clouds  observation equipment was additional reconnaissance data was utilized to modify the working hypothesis  the new theory took cumulus towers outside the eyewall into account  according to the revised theory  by seeding the towers  latent heat would be released  this would trigger the start of new convection  which would then cause a new eyewall  since the new eyewall was outside the original one  the first eyewall would be choked of energy and fall apart  in addition  since the new eyewall was broader than the old one  the winds would be lower due to a less sharp pressure debbie in 1969  provided the best opportunity to test the underpinnings of project stormfury  in many ways it was the perfect storm for seeding  it did not threaten any land  it passed within range of seeding aircraft  and was intense with a distinct on august 18  and again on august 20,  thirteen planes flew out to the storm to monitor and seed it  on the first day  windspeeds fell by on the second day  windspeeds fell by both changes were consistent with stormfury s working hypothesis  indeed  the results were so encouraging that  a greatly expanded research program was among other conclusions was the need for frequent seeding at close to hourly 1970  and 1971  seasons provided no suitable seeding despite this  flights were conducted into hurricane ginger  ginger was not a suitable storm for seeding  due to its diffuse  indistinct nature  the seeding had no effect  ginger was the last seeding done by project hurricanes meeting all of the criteria were extremely rare  which made duplication of the  success  reached with hurricane debbie extremely difficult  meanwhile  developments outside of meteorology hindered the cause of hurricane modification in the early 1970s,  the navy withdrew from the stormfury began to refocus its efforts on understanding  rather than modifying  tropical at the same time  the project s aircraft were nearing the end of their operational lifetimes  at the cost of $30  million  year two lockheed p-3's  were acquired  due to the rarity of atlantic hurricanes meeting the safety requirements  plans were made to move stormfury to the pacific and experiment on the large number of typhoons this action required many of the same safety requirements as in the atlantic  but had the advantage of a much higher number of potential plan was to begin again in 1976,  and seed typhoons by flying out of guam  however  political issues blocked the plan  the people s republic of china announced that it would not be happy if a seeded typhoon changed course and made landfall on its while japan declared itself willing to put up with difficulties caused by typhoons because that country got more than half of its rainfall from tropical plans to operate stormfury in the eastern north pacific or in the australian region also eyewalls had been detected in very strong hurricanes before  including typhoon and hurricane although the double eyes were usually seen in very intense systems  double eyewalls were also seen post-seeding  in some of the seeded storms  at the time however  the only known times that rapid changes in eyewall diameter  other than during presumably successful seedings  was during rapid changes in it remained controversial whether the seedings caused the secondary eyewalls or whether it was just a natural basically  if eyewall changes similar to those observed in seeded hurricanes were rare in unseeded tropical cyclones  it would provide powerful evidence that project stormfury was successful  conversely  if such changes were common in unseeded systems  it would throw doubt on the very hypothesis and assumptions driving project and observations began to accumulate that debunked stormfury s working hypothesis  beginning with hurricanes anita and david  flights by hurricane hunter aircraft encountered events similar to what happened in  successfully  seeded anita itself had a weak example of a concentric eyewall cycle  and david a more dramatic in august 1980,  hurricane allen passed through the atlantic  caribbean  and gulf of mexico  it also underwent changes in the diameter of its eye and developed multiple eyewalls  all this was consistent with the behavior that would have been expected of allen had it been seeded  thus  what stormfury was accomplishing by seeding was also happening on its observations in hurricanes anita  david  frederic  and also discovered that tropical cyclones have very little supercooled water and a great deal of ice the reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the updrafts within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or as cloud seeding needed supercooled water to function  the lack of supercooled water meant that seeding would have no effect those observations called the basis for project stormfury into question  in the middle of 1983,  stormfury was finally canceled after the hypothesis guiding its efforts was the sense of weakening hurricanes to reduce their destructiveness  project stormfury was a complete failure because it did not distinguish between natural phenomena in tropical cyclones and the impact of human millions of dollars had been spent trying to do the impossible  in the end  stormfury had two fatal flaws  it was neither microphysically nor statistically addition  stormfury had been a primary generator of funding for the hurricane research division  while the project was operational  the hrd s budget had been around $4  million (1975  usd  $16  million 2008  usd   with a staff of approximately 100  today  the hrd employs 30  people and has a budget of roughly $2.6  million each project stormfury had positive results as well  knowledge gained during flights proved invaluable in debunking its other science resulted in a greater understanding of tropical cyclones  in addition  the lockheed p-3's  were perfectly suitable for gathering data on tropical cyclones  allowing improved forecasting of these monstrous those planes are still used by the noaa cuban president fidel castro alleged that project stormfury was an attempt to weaponize
