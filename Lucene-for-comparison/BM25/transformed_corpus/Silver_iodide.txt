 silver iodide -  wikipediasilver iodide is an inorganic compound with the formula agi  the compound is a bright yellow solid  but samples almost always contain impurities of metallic silver that give a gray coloration  the silver contamination arises because agi is highly photosensitive  this property is exploited in silver-based  photography  silver iodide is also used as an antiseptic and in cloud seeding the structure adopted by silver iodide is temperature iodide is prepared by reaction of an iodide solution  e g   potassium iodide  with a solution of silver ions  e g   silver nitrate   a yellowish solid quickly precipitates  the solid is a mixture of the two principal phases  dissolution of the agi in hydroiodic acid  followed by dilution with water precipitates β-agi.  alternatively  dissolution of agi in a solution of concentrated silver nitrate followed by dilution affords if the preparation is not conducted in the absence of sunlight  the solid darkens rapidly  the light causing the reduction of ionic silver to metallic  the photosensitivity varies with sample purity the crystalline structure of β-agi  is similar to that of ice  allowing it to induce freezing by the process known as heterogeneous nucleation  approximately 50,000  kg are used for cloud seeding annually  each seeding experiment consuming 10–50  exposure can lead to argyria  characterized by localized discoloration of body
