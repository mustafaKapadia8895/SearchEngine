 mesoscale convective vortex -  wikipediaa mesoscale convective vortex  mcv  is a low-pressure  center  mesolow  within an mesoscale convective system  mcs  that pulls winds into a circling pattern  or vortex  with a core only 30  to 60  mi (48  to 97  km  wide and 1  to 3  mi (1.6  to 4.8  km  deep  an mcv is often overlooked in standard surface they have been most often been detected on radar and satellite  particularly with the higher resolution and sensitivity of wsr-88d,  but with the advent of mesonets  these mesoscale features can also be detected in surface analysis  yet an mcv can take on a life of its own  persisting for more than 12  hours after its parent mcs has dissipated  this orphaned mcv will sometimes then become the seed of the next thunderstorm outbreak  their remnants will often lead to an  agitated area  of increased cumulus activity that can eventually become an area of thunderstorm formation and associated low-level  boundaries left behind can themselves cause convergence and vorticity that can increase the level of organization and intensity of any storms that do form  an mcv that moves into tropical waters  such as the gulf of mexico  can serve as the nucleus for a tropical storm or hurricane  mcvs  like mesovortices  often cause an intensification of convective downburst winds and can lead to one form of mcv is the  comma head  of a line echo wave pattern  lewp  on friday  may 8,  2009,  a major mcv controversially dubbed an  inland hurricane  by local media moved through southern missouri  southern illinois  western kentucky  and southwestern indiana  killing at least 6  and injuring dozens more  damage estimates were in the hundreds of millions  top speeds of 106  mph (171  km h  were reported in carbondale
