 1887  atlantic hurricane season -  wikipediathe 1887  atlantic hurricane season was the most active atlantic hurricane season on record at the time  however  it has been surpassed by the 1933  and 2005,  now tying with the 1995,  2010,  2011,  and the 2012  seasons for having the third most number of storms  1887  also featured five off-season  storms  the season ran through the summer and almost all of the fall in 1887,  and was surpassed in total number of tropical cyclones only by the seasons of 1933  and the record-breaking  2005.  the 1887  season saw tropical activity as early as may  and as late as december  tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes  especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration  may have remained undetected  because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s,  historical data on tropical cyclones from this period may not be comprehensive  an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851  and 1885  and zero to four per year between 1886  and 1910  has been of the known 1887  cyclones  tropical storm one and tropical storm three were first documented in 1996  by jose fernandez-partagas  and henry diaz  they also proposed large alterations to the known tracks of several of the other 1887  later re-analysis  led to the known duration of hurricane six  and also that of hurricane fifteen  being of the season s nineteen known storms attained hurricane status  however  only two of these storms became major hurricanes  with sustained winds of over 111  mph (179  km h   the strongest reached peak winds of 125  mph (205  km h   with a minimum barometric pressure of 946  mbar (27.9  inhg  off the east coast of the united states in late august  only a few of the storms during the 1887  season did not impact land  but there was a low number of deaths the first storm of the season formed south of bermuda on may 15,  outside of the season boundaries and moved to the northwest  staying out to sea  after peaking at 70  mph (110  km h  late the next day  it turned northward  and became extratropical on may 18  over newfoundland another may storm formed south of jamaica on may 17,  way outside of the season and moved generally northward  it crossed cuba on may 19  as a tropical storm  and moved out to sea  two peaked at 60  mph (95  km h  twice  once on may 18  and may 20.  two dissipated on may may 21  in the atlantic ocean  when this storm and the first storm were active simultaneously from may 17  to may 18,  it became the earliest for two storms to be active at one time a weak tropical storm  which began its life in the northwest caribbean sea on june 12.  three peaked at 40  mph (65  km h  and moved northward through the gulf of mexico  and dissipated on june 14  after making landfall in mississippi on july 20  a tropical storm formed 150  miles southeast of the next day it passed south of the island as a category 1  hurricane and caused several vessels to be wrecked or to be run aground there  the hurricane continued westward into the caribbean sea  becoming a strong category 2  hurricane with winds of 100  mph (160  km h  on july 22.  although the hurricane passed far to the south of cuba  it caused several vessels to sink at bataban칩 and brought heavy rain and flooding to the islands interior  continuing westward  the hurricane passed over the eastern tip of the yucat치n peninsula before first turning northward and then northeasterly  it made landfall on the florida panhandle on the morning of july 27  as a category 1  hurricane  with a wind speed of 85  mph (140  km h   the storm continued northward  as a tropical storm  before dissipating late on july 28  near augusta  georgia  the storm and its remnants brought heavy rain to the southeast  up to 8  inches in cedar keys and a maximum of 16.5  inches (420  mm  at union point  the cyclone caused extensive damage to the cotton crop throughout georgia and depression five formed east of the windward islands on july 30  and moved northwestward across the caribbean sea  strengthening into a storm and reaching peak winds of 60  mph (97  km h  on august 2  near st  vincent before dissipating near cuba six days later the season s first of two major hurricanes  both following a very similar cape verde-type  hurricane path in mid-august,  but remained offshore  six formed on august 14  in the middle of the atlantic ocean  six started moving toward the carolina coast and moved far north and peaked as a 120  mph (190  km h    967  mbar major hurricane on august 20,  when rapid weakening began  six was declared extratropical two days later the season s second of two major hurricanes  both following a very similar cape verde-type  hurricane path in mid-august,  but remained offshore  seven formed from a depression on august 18  into tropical storm 7  and followed the same track as six  seven peaked at 125  mph (205  km h  winds for three straight days as a major hurricane and rapid weakening began  seven was declared extratropical on august 27.on  september 1,  a tropical storm formed in the central atlantic ocean  it moved northwestward  becoming a hurricane on september 2.  the hurricane turned to the northeast  and peaked at 105  mph (169  km h  as a category 2  hurricane before becoming extratropical on september 4.  the extratropical storm remained until september 6,  when it dissipated off the coast of ireland a hurricane  which was first observed on september 11  to the east of the lesser antilles  traversed the caribbean sea  remaining away from land until hitting extreme northeast yucat치n peninsula on september 17.  it moved across the gulf of mexico  and weakened slightly before landfall as it hit near brownsville  texas on september 21  as an 85  mph (140  km h  hurricane  the storm rapidly weakened over texas and northeast mexico  and dissipated on the

seen in new orleans  trees were blown down in algiers and there were significant amounts of crop damage in abbeville and iberville the storm swept across georgia and the carolinas before becoming dissipating at sea early on october october 14,  a storm moved over belize  causing moderate crop damage and disruption in the southern part of the country  because the 13th  storm of the season existed at the same time to its northeast  this system was not included  though further research is under way to determine if it was a new storm or a variation of the 13th  storm of the season on october 10,  a depression strengthened into tropical storm fourteen and moved across the ocean  fourteen peaked with 85  mph (140  km h  winds as a category 1  hurricane on october 11.  on october 12,  fourteen weakened and was declared extratropical a tropical storm was discovered on late afternoon of october 15  and was named tropical storm fifteen on that day with 80  mph (130  km h  winds  from

took a long  erratic track across the caribbean sea and the atlantic ocean  sixteen made landfall and moved across florida as a tropical storm on october 30.  sixteen paralleled the carolina coastline and peaked at an 70  mph (110  km h  storm with a tropical pressure of 993  mbar on october 31.  sixteen was declared extratropical a day later and hit an extratropical peak of 80  mph (130  km h  and a 990  mbar extratropical pressure  the storm was dissipated on november 6.  sixteen caused a ship to capsize  killing 2  sailors  and resulted in the loss of four other ships on november 27,  a tropical storm formed north of puerto rico  it moved to the west-northwest,  and looped to the northeast  while looping  it peaked at 80  mph (130  km h   but rapid weakening began while the storm was

continued westward until dissipating near the coast of costa rica on december 12.  when tropical storm nineteen formed on december 7,  it made 1887  the year with the most off-season  storms  five  at the time  nineteen was the only tropical storm to pass over costa rica on record  in 2016,  hurricane otto passed over costa rica as a minimal hurricane  however  prior to doing this otto made landfall in extreme southern therefore  nineteen remains the only tropical storm recorded to make landfall in costa rica.1933  (259)2005  (250)1893  (231)1926  (230)1995  (228)2004  (227)2017
