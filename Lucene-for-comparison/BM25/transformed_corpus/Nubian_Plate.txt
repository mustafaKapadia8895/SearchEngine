 african plate -  wikipediathe african plate is a major tectonic plate straddling the equator as well as the prime meridian  it includes much of the continent of africa  as well as oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges  between 60  million years ago and 10  million years ago  the somali plate began rifting from the african plate along the east african since the continent of africa consists of crust from both the african and the somali plates  some literature refers to the african plate as the nubian plate to distinguish it from the continent as a western edge of the african plate is a divergent boundary with the north american plate to the north and the south american plate to the south which forms the central and southern part of the mid-atlantic  ridge  the african plate is bounded on the northeast by the arabian plate  the southeast by the somali plate  the north by the eurasian plate  the aegean sea plate  and the anatolian plate  and on the south by the antarctic plate  all of these are divergent or spreading boundaries with the exception of the northern boundary and a short segment near the azores known as the terceira rift the african plate includes several cratons  stable blocks of old crust with deep roots in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle  and less stable terranes  which came together to form the african continent during the assembly of the supercontinent pangea around 550  million years ago  the cratons are  from south to north  the kalahari craton  congo craton  tanzania craton and west african craton  the cratons were widely separated in the past  but came together during the pan-african  orogeny and stayed together when gondwana split up  the cratons are connected by orogenic belts  regions of highly deformed rock where the tectonic plates have engaged  the saharan metacraton has been tentatively identified as the remains of a craton that has become detached from the subcontinental lithospheric mantle  but alternatively may consist of a collection of unrelated crustal fragments swept together during the pan-african  orogeny in some areas  the cratons are covered by sedimentary basins  such as the tindouf basin  taoudeni basin and congo basin  where the underlying archaic crust is overlaid by more recent neoproterozoic sediments  the plate includes shear zones such as the central african shear zone  casz  where  in the past  two sections of the crust were moving in opposite directions  and rifts such as the anza trough where the crust was pulled apart  and the resulting depression filled with more modern sediment the african plate is rifting in the eastern interior of the african continent along the east african rift  this rift zone separates the african plate to the west from the somali plate to the east  one hypothesis proposes the existence of a mantle plume beneath the afar region  whereas an opposing hypothesis asserts that the rifting is merely a zone of maximum weakness where the african plate is deforming as plates to its east are moving rapidly northward the african plate s speed is estimated at around 2.15  cm (0.85  in  per it has been moving over the past 100  million years or so in a general northeast direction  this is drawing it closer to the eurasian plate  causing subduction where oceanic crust is converging with continental crust  e g  portions of the central and eastern mediterranean   in the western mediterranean  the relative motions of the eurasian and african plates produce a combination of lateral and compressive forces  concentrated in a zone known as the azoresâ€“gibraltar fault zone  along its northeast margin  the african plate is bounded by the red sea rift where the arabian plate is moving away from the african plate the new england hotspot in the atlantic ocean has probably created a short line of mid-  to late-tertiary  age seamounts on the african plate but appears to be currently
