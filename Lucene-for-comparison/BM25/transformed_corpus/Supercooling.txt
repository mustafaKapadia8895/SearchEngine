 supercooling -  wikipediasupercooling  also known as is the process of lowering the temperature of a liquid or a gas below its freezing point without it becoming a solid a liquid crossing its standard freezing point will crystalize in the presence of a seed crystal or nucleus around which a crystal structure can form creating a solid  lacking any such nuclei  the liquid phase can be maintained all the way down to the temperature at which crystal homogeneous nucleation occurs  homogeneous nucleation can occur above the glass transition temperature  but if homogeneous nucleation has not occurred above that temperature  an amorphous (non-crystalline)  solid will form water normally freezes at 273.15  k (0  °c or 32  °f   but it can be  supercooled  at standard pressure down to its crystal homogeneous nucleation at almost 224.8  k (−48.3  °c/−55  the process of supercooling requires that water be pure and free of nucleation sites  which can be achieved by processes like reverse osmosis or chemical demineralization  but the cooling itself does not require any specialised technique  if water is cooled at a rate on the order of 106  k s  the crystal nucleation can be avoided and water becomes a glass — that is  an amorphous (non-crystalline)  solid  its glass transition temperature is much colder and harder to determine  but studies estimate it at about 136  k (−137  °c/−215  glassy water can be heated up to approximately 150  k (−123  °c/−189.4  °f  without nucleation in the range of temperatures between 231  k (−42  °c/−43.6  °f  and 150  k (−123  °c/−189.4  °f   experiments find only crystal ice droplets of supercooled water often exist in stratiform and cumulus clouds  an aircraft flying through such a cloud sees an abrupt crystallization of these droplets  which can result in the formation of ice on the aircraft s wings or blockage of its instruments and probes  unless the aircraft is equipped with an appropriate de-icing  system  freezing rain is also caused by supercooled droplets the process opposite to supercooling  the melting of a solid above the freezing point  is much more difficult  and a solid will almost always melt at the same temperature for a given pressure  for this reason  it is the melting point which is usually identified  using melting point apparatus  even when the subject of a paper is "freezing-point  determination   the actual methodology is  the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of it is possible  at a given pressure  to superheat a liquid above its boiling point without it becoming gaseous supercooling is often confused with freezing-point  depression  supercooling is the cooling of a liquid below its freezing point without it becoming solid  freezing point depression is when a solution can be cooled below the freezing point of the corresponding pure liquid due to the presence of the solute  an example of this is the freezing point depression that occurs when sodium chloride is added to pure water constitutional supercooling  which occurs during solidification  is due to compositional solid changes  and results in cooling a liquid below the freezing point ahead of the solid–liquid interface  when solidifying a liquid  the interface is often unstable  and the velocity of the solid–liquid interface must be small in order to avoid constitutional supercooling supercooled zones are observed when the liquidus temperature gradient at the interface is larger than the temperature gradient orthe slope of the liquidus phase boundary on the phase diagram is m   ∂ t l   ∂ c l   displaystyle m  partial t  l   partial c  l   the concentration gradient is related to points  c l s   displaystyle c  ls   and c s l   displaystyle c  sl     on the phase diagram for steady-state  growth c s l   c 0    displaystyle c^{sl}=c_{0}}  and the partition function k   c s l c l s   displaystyle k   frac  c  sl   c  ls     can be assumed to be constant  therefore  the minimum thermal gradient necessary to create a stable solid front is as expressed below for more information  see the equation (3)  following paragraphs are about freezing-point  depression  they are not about supercooling  the authors are confusing supercooling with freezing-point  depression  the paragraphs above warn about this confusion in order to survive extreme low temperatures in certain environments  some animals use the phenomenon of freezing-point  depression that allow them to remain unfrozen and avoid cell damage and death  there are many techniques that aid in lowering the freezing point  such as the production of antifreeze proteins  or afps  which bind to ice crystals to prevent water molecules from binding and spreading the growth of the winter flounder is one such fish that utilizes these proteins to survive in its frigid environment  noncolligative proteins are secreted by the liver into the other animals use colligative antifreezes  which increases the concentration of solutes in their bodily fluids  thus lowering their freezing point  fish that rely on supercooling for survival must also live well below the water surface  because if they came into contact with ice nuclei they would freeze immediately  animals that undergo supercooling to survive must also remove ice-nucleating  agents from their bodies because they act as a starting point for freezing  supercooling is also common in insects  reptiles  and other ectotherms  with insects being able to survive in the coldest environments out of any supercooling animals it should be noted that supercooling is a last resort for animals  the best option is to move to a warmer environment if possible  as an animal gets farther and farther below its original freezing point the chance of spontaneous freezing increases dramatically for its internal fluids  as this is a thermodynamically unstable state  the fluids eventually reach the supercooling point  which is the temperature at which the supercooled solution freezes spontaneously due to being so far below its normal freezing animals unintentionally undergo supercooling and are only able to decrease the odds of freezing once supercooled  even though supercooling is essential for survival  there are many risks associated with it as demonstrated by animals  plants can also survive extreme cold conditions brought forth during the winter months  many plant species located in northern climates can acclimate under these cold conditions by supercooling  thus these plants survive temperatures up to -40  °c  although this supercooling phenomenon is poorly understood  it has been recognized through infrared thermography  ice nucleation occurs in certain plant organs and tissues  debatably beginning in the xylem tissue and spreading throughout the rest of the infrared thermography allows for droplets of water to be visualized as they crystalize in extracellular inhibits the formation of ice within the tissue by ice nucleation and allows the cells to maintain water in a liquid state and further allows the water within the cell to stay separate from extracellular cellular barriers such as lignin  suberin and the cuticle inhibit ice nucleators and force water into the supercooled the xylem and primary tissue of plants are very susceptible to cold temperatures because of the large proportion of water in the cell  many boreal hardwood species in northern climates have the ability to prevent ice spreading into the shoots allowing the plant to tolerate the supercooling has been identified in the evergreen shrubs rhododendron ferrugineum and vaccinium vitis-idaea  as well as abies  picea and larix freezing outside of the cell and within the cell wall does not affect the survival of the however  the extracellular ice may lead to plant commercial application of supercooling is in refrigeration  freezers can cool drinks to a supercooled so that when they are opened  they form a slush  another example is a product that can supercool the beverage in a conventional the coca-cola  company briefly marketed special vending machines containing sprite in the uk  and coke in singapore  which stored the bottles in a supercooled state so that their content would turn to slush upon was successfully applied to organ preservation at massachusetts general hospital harvard medical school  livers that were later transplanted into recipient animals were preserved by supercooling for up to 96  hours (4  days   quadrupling the limits of what could be achieved by conventional liver preservation methods  the livers were supercooled to a temperature of –6  °c in a specialized solution that protected against freezing and injury from the cold potential application is drug delivery  in 2015  researchers demonstrated the ability to crystallize membranes at a specific time  liquid-encapsulated  drugs can potentially be delivered to the site and with a slight environmental change  the liquid rapidly changes into a crystalline form that releases the 2016  a team at iowa state university proposed a method for  soldering without heat  by using encapsulated droplets of supercooled liquid metal to repair heat sensitive electronic
