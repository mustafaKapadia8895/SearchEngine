 norwegian sea -  wikipediathe norwegian sea  norwegian  norskehavet  is a marginal sea in the arctic ocean  northwest of norway  it is located between the north sea  i e  north of the united kingdom  and the greenland sea and adjoins the barents sea to the northeast  in the southwest  it is separated from the atlantic ocean by a submarine ridge running between iceland and the faroe islands  to the north  the jan mayen ridge separates it from the greenland sea unlike many other seas  most of the bottom of the norwegian sea is not part of a continental shelf and therefore lies at a great depth of about two kilometres on average  rich deposits of oil and natural gas are found under the sea bottom and are being explored commercially  in the areas with sea depths of up to about one kilometre  the coastal zones are rich in fish that visit the norwegian sea from the north atlantic or from the barents sea  cod  for spawning  the warm north atlantic current ensures relatively stable and high water temperatures  so that unlike the arctic seas  the norwegian sea is ice-free  throughout the year  recent research has concluded that the large volume of water in the norwegian sea with its large heat absorption capacity is more important as a source of norway s mild winters than the gulf stream and its international hydrographic organization defines the limits of the norwegian sea as norwegian sea was formed about 250  million years ago  when the eurasian plate of norway and the north american plate  including greenland  started to move apart  the existing narrow shelf sea between norway and greenland began to widen and the present continental slope in the norwegian sea marks the border between norway and greenland as it stood approximately 250  million years ago  in the north it extends east from svalbard and on the southwest between britain and the faroes  this continental slope contains rich fishing grounds and numerous coral reefs  settling of the shelf after the separation of the continents has resulted in landslides  such as the storegga slide about 8,000  years ago that induced a major coasts of the norwegian sea were shaped during the last ice age  large glaciers several kilometres high pushed into the land  forming fjords  removing the crust into the sea  and thereby extending the continental slopes  this is particularly clear off the norwegian coast along helgeland and north to the lofoten the norwegian continental shelf is between 40  and 200  kilometres wide  and has a different shape from the shelves in the north sea and barents sea  it contains numerous trenches and irregular peaks  which usually have an amplitude of less than 100  metres  but can reach up to 400  they are covered with a mixture of gravel  sand  and mud  and the trenches are used by fish as spawning deeper into the sea  there are two deep basins separated by a low ridge  its deepest point at 3,000  m  between the vøring plateau and jan mayen island  the southern basin is larger and deeper  with large areas between 3,500  and 4,000  metres deep  the northern basin is shallower at 3,200–3,300  metres  but contains many individual sites going down to 3,500  submarine thresholds and continental slopes mark the borders of these basins with the adjacent seas  to the south lies the european continental shelf and the north sea  to the east is the eurasian continental shelf with the barents sea  to the west  the scotland-greenland  ridge separates the norwegian sea from the north atlantic  this ridge is on average only 500  metres deep  only in a few places reaching the depth of 850  metres  to the north lie the jan mayen ridge and mohns ridge  which lie at a depth of 2,000  metres  with some trenches reaching depths of about 2,600  major water masses originating in the atlantic and arctic oceans meet in the norwegian sea  and the associated currents are of fundamental importance for the global climate  the warm  salty north atlantic current flows in from the atlantic ocean  and the colder and less saline norwegian current originates in the north sea  the so-called  east iceland current transports cold water south from the norwegian sea toward iceland and then east  along the arctic circle  this current occurs in the middle water layer  deep water flows into the norwegian sea from the greenland the tides in the sea are semi-diurnal;  that is  they rise twice a day  to a height of about 3.3  hydrology of the upper water layers is largely determined by the flow from the north atlantic  it reaches a speed of 10  sv (1  sv   million m3/s)  and its maximum depth is 700  metres at the lofoten islands  but normally it is within 500  part of it comes through the faroe-shetland  channel and has a comparatively high salinity of 35.3‰   parts per thousand   this current originates in the north atlantic current and passes along the european continental slope  increased evaporation due to the warm european climate results in the elevated salinity  another part passes through the greenland-scotland  trench between the faroe islands and iceland  this water has a mean salinity between 35  and the flow shows strong seasonal variations and can be twice as high in winter as in while at the faroe-shetland  channel it has a temperature of about 9.5  °c  it cools to about 5  °c at svalbard and releases this energy  about 250  terawatts  to the current flowing from the north sea originates in the baltic sea and thus collects most of the drainage from northern europe  this contribution is however relatively the temperature and salinity of this current show strong seasonal and annual fluctuations  long-term  measurements within the top 50  metres near the coast show a maximum temperature of 11.2  °c at the 63°  n parallel in september and a minimum of 3.9  °c at the north cape in march  the salinity varies between 34.3  and 34.6‰  and is lowest in spring owing to the inflow of melted snow from the largest rivers discharging into the sea are namsen  ranelva and vefsna  they are all relatively short  but have a high discharge rate owing to their steep mountainous portion of the warm surface water flows directly  within the west spitsbergen current  from the atlantic ocean  off the greenland sea  to the arctic ocean  this current has a speed of 3–5  sv and has a large impact on the other surface water (~1  sv  flows along the norwegian coast in the direction of the barents sea  this water may cool enough in the norwegian sea to submerge into the deeper layers  there it displaces water that flows back into the north water from the east iceland current is mostly found in the southwestern part of the sea  near greenland  its properties also show significant annual fluctuations  with long-term  average temperature being below 3  °c and salinity between 34.7  and the fraction of this water on the sea surface depends on the strength of the current  which in turn depends on the pressure difference between the icelandic low and azores high  the larger the difference  the stronger the norwegian sea is connected with the greenland sea and the arctic ocean by the 2,600-metre  deep fram the norwegian sea deep water  nsdw  occurs at depths exceeding 2,000  metres  this homogeneous layer with a salinity of 34.91‰  experiences little exchange with the adjacent seas  its temperature is below 0  °c and drops to −1  °c at the ocean compared with the deep waters of the surrounding seas  nsdw has more nutrients but less oxygen and is relatively weak deep-water  exchange with the atlantic ocean is due to the small depth of the relatively flat greenland-scotland  ridge between scotland and greenland  an offshoot of the mid-atlantic  ridge  only four areas of the greenland-scotland  ridge are deeper than 500  metres  the faroe bank channel  about 850  metres   some parts of the iceland-faroe  ridge  about 600  metres   the wyville-thomson  ridge (620  metres   and areas between greenland and the denmark strait (850  meters  – this is much shallower than the norwegian cold deep water flows into the atlantic through various channels  about 1.9  sv through the faroe bank channel  1.1  sv through the iceland-faroe  channel  and 0.1  sv via the wyville-thomson  the turbulence that occurs when the deep water falls behind the greenland-scotland  ridge into the deep atlantic basin mixes the adjacent water layers and forms the north atlantic deep water  one of two major deep-sea  currents providing the deep ocean with thermohaline circulation affects the climate in the norwegian sea  and the regional climate can significantly deviate from average  there is also a difference of about 10  °c between the sea and the coastline  temperatures rose between 1920  and and the frequency of storms decreased in this period  the storminess was relatively high between 1880  and 1910,  decreased significantly in 1910–1960,  and then recovered to the original contrast to the greenland sea and arctic seas  the norwegian sea is ice-free  year round  owing to its warm the convection between the relatively warm water and cold air in the winter plays an important role in the arctic the 10-degree  july isotherm  air temperature line  runs through the northern boundary of the norwegian sea and is often taken as the southern boundary of the in winter  the norwegian sea generally has the lowest air pressure in the entire arctic and where most icelandic low depressions form  the water temperature in most parts of the sea is 2–7  °c in february and 8–12  °c in norwegian sea is a transition zone between boreal and arctic conditions  and thus contains flora and fauna characteristic of both climatic the southern limit of many arctic species runs through the north cape  iceland  and the center of the norwegian sea  while the northern limit of boreal species lies near the borders of the greenland sea with the norwegian sea and barents sea  that is  these areas overlap  some species like the scallop chlamys islandica and capelin tend to occupy this area between the atlantic and arctic of the aquatic life in the norwegian sea is concentrated in the upper layers  estimates for the entire north atlantic are that only 2%  of biomass is produced at depths below 1,000  metres and only 1.2%  occurs near the sea blooming of the phytoplankton is dominated by chlorophyll and peaks around 20  may  the major phytoplankton forms are diatoms  in particular the genus thalassiosira and chaetoceros  after the spring bloom the haptophytes of the genus phaecocystis pouchetti become pandalus borealislophelia pertusameganyctiphanes norvegicazooplankton is mostly represented by the copepods calanus finmarchicus and calanus hyperboreus  where the former occurs about four times more often than the latter and is mostly found in the atlantic streams  whereas c  hyperboreus dominates the arctic they are the main diet of most marine the most important krill species are meganyctiphanes norvegica  thyssanoessa inermis  and thyssanoessa in contrast to the greenland sea  there is a significant presence of calcareous plankton  coccolithophore and globigerinida  in the norwegian plankton production strongly fluctuates between years  for example  c  finmarchicus yield was 28  g m²  dry weight  in 1995  and only 8  g m² in 1997;  this correspondingly affected the population of all its of the species pandalus borealis play an important role in the diet of fish  particularly cod and blue whiting  and mostly occur at depths between 200  and 300  metres  a special feature of the norwegian sea is extensive coral reefs of lophelia pertusa  which provide shelter to various fish species  although these corals are widespread in many peripheral areas of the north atlantic  they never reach such amounts and concentrations as at the norwegian continental slopes  however  they are at risk due to increasing trawling  which mechanically destroys the coral norwegian coastal waters are the most important spawning ground of the herring populations of the north atlantic  and the hatching occurs in march  the eggs float to the surface and are washed off the coast by the northward current  whereas a small herring population remains in the fjords and along the northern norwegian coast  the majority spends the summer in the barents sea  where it feeds on the rich plankton  upon reaching puberty  herring returns to the norwegian the herring stock varies greatly between years  it increased in the 1920s  owing to the milder climate and then collapsed in the following decades until 1970;  the decrease was  however  at least partly caused by the biomass of young hatched herring declined from 11  million tonnes in 1956  to almost zero in that affected the ecosystem not only of the norwegian sea but also of the barents of environmental and fishing regulations has resulted in partial recovery of the herring populations since this recovery was accompanied by a decline of capelin and cod stocks  while the capelin benefited from the reduced fishing  the temperature rise in the 1980s  and competition for food with the herring resulted in a near disappearance of young capelin from the norwegian meanwhile  the elderly capelin population was quickly fished out  this also reduced the population of cod – a major predator of capelin – as the herring was still too small in numbers to replace the capelin in the cod s whiting  micromesistius poutassou  has benefited from the decline of the herring and capelin stocks as it assumed the role of major predator of plankton  the blue whiting spawns near the british isles  the sea currents carry their eggs to the norwegian sea  and the adults also swim there to benefit from the food supply  the young spend the summer and the winter until february in norwegian coastal waters and then return to the warmer waters west of the norwegian arctic cod mostly occurs in the barents sea and at the svalbard archipelago  in the rest of the norwegian sea  it is found only during the reproduction season  at the lofoten whereas pollachius virens and haddock spawn in the coastal mackerel is an important commercial fish  the coral reefs are populated by different species of the genus numbers of minke  humpback  sei  and orca whales are present in the norwegian and white-beaked  dolphins occur in the coastal orcas and some other whales visit the sea in the summer months for feeding  their population is closely related to the herring stocks  and they follow the herring schools within the with a total population of about 110,000,  minke whales are by far the most common whales in the sea  they are hunted by norway and iceland  with a quota of about 1,000  per year in norway  in contrast to the past  nowadays primarily their meat is consumed  rather than fat and bowhead whale used to be a major plankton predator  but it almost disappeared from the norwegian sea after intense whaling in the 19th  and was temporarily extinct in the entire north atlantic  similarly  the blue whale used to form large groups between jan mayen and spitsbergen  but is hardly present observations of northern bottlenose whales in the norwegian sea are other large animals of the sea are hooded and harp seals and waterfowl species of the norwegian sea are puffin  kittiwake and guillemot  puffins and guillemots also suffered from the collapse of the herring population  especially the puffins on the lofoten islands  the latter hardly had an alternative to herring and their population was approximately halved between 1969  and iceland  and denmark faroe islands share the territorial waters of the norwegian sea  with the largest part belonging to the first  norway has claimed twelve-mile  limit as territorial waters since 2004  and an exclusive economic zone of 200  miles since 1976.  consequently  due to the norwegian islands of svalbard and jan mayen  the southeast  northeast and northwest edge of the sea fall within norway  the southwest border is shared between iceland and denmark faroe largest damage to the norwegian sea was caused by extensive fishing  whaling  and pollution  the british nuclear complex of sellafield is one of the greatest polluters  discharging radioactive waste into the sea  other contamination is mostly by oil and toxic but also from the great number of ships sunk during the two world the environmental protection of the norwegian sea is mainly regulated by the ospar has been practised near the lofoten archipelago for hundreds of years  the coastal waters of the remote lofoten islands are one of the richest fishing areas in europe  as most of the atlantic cod swims to the coastal waters of lofoten in the winter to spawn  so in the 19th  century  dried cod was one of norway s main exports and by far the most important industry in northern norway  strong sea currents  maelstroms  and especially frequent storms made fishing a dangerous occupation  several hundred men died on the  fatal monday  in march 1821,  300  of them from a single parish  and about a hundred boats with their crews were lost within a short time in april was also important for the norwegian sea  in the early 1600s,  the englishman stephen bennet started hunting walrus at bear island  in may 1607  the muscovy company  while looking for the northwest passage and exploring the sea  discovered the large populations of walrus and whales in the norwegian sea and started hunting them in 1610  near later in the 17th  century  dutch ships started hunting bowhead whales near jan mayen  the bowhead population between svalbard and jan mayen was then about 25,000  britons and dutch were then joined by germans  danes  and between 1615  and 1820,  the waters between jan mayen  svalbard  bear island  and greenland  between the norwegian  greenland  and barents seas  were the most productive whaling area in the world  however  extensive hunting had wiped out the whales in that region by the early 20th  many centuries  the norwegian sea was regarded as the edge of the known world  the disappearance of ships there  due to the natural disasters  induced legends of monsters that stopped and sank ships  kraken   as late as in 1845,  the encyclopædia metropolitana contained a multi-page  review by erik pontoppidan (1698–1764)  on ship-sinking  sea monsters half a mile in many legends might be based on the work historia de gentibus septentrionalibus of 1539  by olaus magnus  which described the kraken and maelstroms of the norwegian the kraken also appears in alfred tennyson s poem of the same name  in herman melville s moby dick  and in twenty thousand leagues under the sea by jules verne between the lofoten islands of moskenesøya and værøy  at the tiny mosken island  lies the moskenstraumen – a system of tidal eddies and a whirlpool called a maelstrom  with a speed on the order of 15  km h (9  mph   the value strongly varies between sources   it is one of the strongest maelstroms in the world  it was described in the 13th  century in the old norse poetic edda and remained an attractive subject for painters and writers  including edgar allan poe  walter moers and jules verne  the word was introduced into the english language by poe in his story  a descent into the maelström  (1841)  describing the the moskenstraumen is created as a result of a combination of several factors  including the tides  the position of the lofoten  and the underwater topography  unlike most other whirlpools  it is located in the open sea rather than in a channel or bay  with a diameter of 40–50  metres  it can be dangerous even in modern times to small fishing vessels that might be attracted by the abundant cod feeding on the microorganisms sucked in by the fish-rich  coastal waters of northern norway have long been known and attracted skilled sailors from iceland and greenland  thus most settlements in iceland and greenland were on the west coasts of the islands  which were also warmer due to the atlantic currents  the first reasonably reliable map of northern europe  the carta marina of 1539,  represents the norwegian sea as coastal waters and shows nothing north of the north cape  the norwegian sea off the coast regions appeared on the maps in the 17th  century as an important part of the then sought northern sea route and a rich whaling mayen island was discovered in 1607  and become an important base of dutch whalers  the dutchman willem barents discovered bear island and which was then used by russian whalers called pomors  the islands on the edge of the norwegian sea have been rapidly divided between nations  during the peaks of whaling  some 300  ships with 12,000  crew members were yearly visiting first depth measurements of the norwegian sea were performed in 1773  by constantine phipps aboard hms racehorse  as a part of his north pole systematic oceanographic research in the norwegian sea started in the late 19th  century  when declines in the yields of cod and herring off the lofoten prompted the norwegian government to investigate the the zoologist georg ossian sars and meteorologist henrik mohn persuaded the government in 1874  to send out a scientific expedition  and between 1876  and 1878  they explored much of the sea aboard the data obtained allowed mohn to establish the first dynamic model of ocean currents  which incorporated winds  pressure differences  sea water temperature  and salinity and agreed well with later the 20th  century  the coasts of the norwegian sea were sparsely populated and therefore shipping in the sea was mostly focused on fishing  whaling  and occasional coastal transportation  since the late 19th  century  the norwegian coastal express sea line has been established  connecting the more densely populated south with the north of norway by at least one trip a day  the importance of shipping in the norwegian sea also increased with the expansion of the russian and soviet navies in the barents sea and development of international routes to the atlantic through the baltic sea  kattegat  skagerrak  and north sea the norwegian sea is ice-free  and provides a direct route from the atlantic to the russian ports in the arctic  murmansk  archangel  and kandalaksha   which are directly linked to central russia  this route was extensively used for supplies during world war ii – of 811  us ships  720  reached russian ports  bringing some 4  million tonnes of cargo that included about 5,000  tanks and 7,000  aircraft  the allies lost 18  convoys and 89  merchant ships on this the major operations of the german navy against the convoys included pq 17  in july 1942,  the battle of the barents sea in december 1942,  and the battle of the north cape in december 1943  and were carried out around the border between the norwegian sea and barents sea  near the north across the norwegian sea declined after world war ii and intensified only in the 1960s–70s  with the expansion of the soviet northern fleet  which was reflected in major joint naval exercises of the soviet northern baltic fleets in the norwegian sea  the sea was the gateway for the soviet navy to the atlantic ocean and thus to the united states  and the major soviet port of murmansk was just behind the border of the norwegian and barents the countermeasures by the nato countries resulted in a significant naval presence in the norwegian sea and intense cat-and-mouse  games between soviet and nato aircraft  ships  and especially a relic of the cold war in the norwegian sea  the soviet nuclear submarine k-278  komsomolets  sank in 1989  southwest of bear island  at the border of the norwegian and barents seas  with radioactive material onboard that poses potential danger to flora and norwegian sea is part of the northern sea route for ships from european ports to asia  the travel distance from rotterdam to tokyo is 21,100  km (13,111  mi  via the suez canal and only 14,100  km (8,761  mi  through the norwegian sea  sea ice is a common problem in the arctic seas  but ice-free  conditions along the entire northern route were observed at the end of august russia is planning to expand its offshore oil production in the arctic  which should increase the traffic of tankers through the norwegian sea to markets in europe and america  it is expected that the number of oil shipments through the northern norwegian sea will increase from 166  in 2002  to 615  in most important products of the norwegian sea are no longer fish  but oil and especially gas found under the ocean norway started undersea oil production in 1993,  followed by development of the huldra gas field in the large depth and harsh waters of the norwegian sea pose significant technical challenges for offshore whereas drilling at depths exceeding 500  meters has been conducted since 1995,  only a few deep gas fields have been explored commercially  the most important current project is ormen lange  depth 800-1,100  m   where gas production started in 2007.  with reserves of 1.4×1013  cubic feet  it is the major norwegian gas field  it is connected to the langeled pipeline  currently the world s longest underwater pipeline  and thus to a major european gas pipeline several other gas fields are being developed  a particular challenge is the kristin field  where the temperature is as high as 170  °c and the gas pressure exceeds 900  bar (900  times the normal further north are norne and snøhvit
