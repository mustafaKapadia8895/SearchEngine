 gibraltar arc -  wikipediathe gibraltar arc is a geological region corresponding to an arcuate orogen surrounding the alboran sea  between the iberian peninsula and africa  it consists of the betic cordillera  south spain   and the rif  north the gibraltar arc is located at the western end of the mediterranean alpine and formed during the neogene due to convergence of the eurasian and african altitudes of the region are reached at the mulhacén peak (3482  m  at the cordillera betica  precipitation is collected mainly by the guadalquivir  betics  and sebou  rif  rivers  which have delivered most sedimentary infill of the homonym sedimentary foreland needed  north–south convergence of the eurasian and african plates occurred during the middle oligocene to the late miocene  followed by northwest–southeast convergence from the late tortonian to present  the gibraltar arc was formed during the neogene due to a combination of western migration of the orogenic mountain front and late orogenic extension  the present convergence rate of the plates is estimated to be approximately 4.5  to 5.0  mm year with an azimuth of eastward gibraltar arc oceanic subduction system was active during the early and middle miocene and has likely been inactive since  at this time  the alboran sea acted as a back-arc  basin during the deposition of accretionary since the late miocene  north–south to northwest–southeast continental convergence forced the subduction system along the arc that is oriented n20°e  to n100°e.  there is a lithospheric slab dipping east from the strait of gibraltar down to 600  km depth beneath the alboran crustal structure of the gibraltar arc is characterized by an arcuate bulge parallel to the arc  with crustal thinning occurring uniformly from the margins of the mountain ranges towards the alboran sea  the lithospheric mantle also has an arcuate bulge below the arc with extreme mantle thinning in the alboran which is the typical structure of a back-arc  basin located on the concave side of an arcuate mountain major left-lateral  strike-slip  fault zone  the trans-alboran  shear zone  crosscuts the gibraltar arc with a ne trend from the eastern betics to the western rif  it was active during the neogene  contributing to the westward advance of the gibraltar arc  some of the previous fault segments are active  with left-lateral  transpressive faulting and moderate to significant clockwise stress rotations  oblique to this shear zone  there are two major right-lateral  strike-slip  fault systems  the maro-nerja  and yusuf systems  these trend nw and have transtensive deformation  the present-day  stress pattern is probably the consequence of the interference between two stress sources  ongoing continent convergence and secondary stress sources from variations in crustal thickness  sedimentary accumulations causing loading  and the active strike-slip  arc has two sections  the internal and external zones  the internal zone  which is located on the inner side of the arc  adjacent to the alboran sea  mostly consists of high-pressure,  low-temperature  metamorphic rocks  the external zone  located on the outer side of the arc  is mostly made of sediments deposited on the passive margins of africa and iberia  these rocks became highly deformed during the westward emplacement of the hinterland of the subduction system  with some units in the external rif having undergone medium-pressure,  low-temperature  metamorphism during the oligocene  flysch units from the cretaceous to early miocene are located between the external and internal zones  these were folded and thrusted during the westward migration of the internal zones and can be interpreted as the palaeo-accretionary  wedge of the subduction system that was active during the lower and middle
