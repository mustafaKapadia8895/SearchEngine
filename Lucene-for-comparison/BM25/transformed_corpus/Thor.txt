 thor -  wikipediain norse mythology  thor   θɔːr   from old norse þórr  is a hammer-wielding  god associated with thunder  lightning  storms  oak trees  strength  the protection of the aesir gods  the fortress of asgard  and also hallowing and fertility  the cognate deity in wider germanic mythology and paganism was known in old english as þunor and in old high german as donar  runic þonar ᚦᛟᚾᚨᚱ   stemming from a common germanic  þunraz  meaning  thunder   ultimately stemming from proto-indo-european  religion  thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the germanic peoples  from the roman occupation of regions of germania  to the tribal expansions of the migration period  to his high popularity during the viking age  when  in the face of the process of the christianization of scandinavia  emblems of his hammer  mjölnir  were worn and norse pagan personal names containing the name of the god bear witness to his popularity into the modern period  thor continued to be acknowledged in rural folklore throughout germanic regions  thor is frequently referred to in place names  the day of the week thursday   thor s day  from old english thunresdæg   thunor s day   bears his name  and names stemming from the pagan period containing his own continue to be used today in norse mythology  largely recorded in iceland from traditional material stemming from scandinavia  numerous tales and information about thor are provided  in these sources  thor bears at least fourteen names  is the husband of the golden-haired  goddess sif  is the lover of the jötunn járnsaxa  and is generally described as fierce eyed  red haired and red with sif  thor fathered the goddess  and possible valkyrie  þrúðr  with járnsaxa  he fathered magni  with a mother whose name is not recorded  he fathered móði  and he is the stepfather of the god ullr  the same sources list thor as the son of the god odin and the personified earth  jörð  and by way of odin  thor has numerous brothers  thor has two servants  þjálfi and röskva  rides in a cart or chariot pulled by two goats  tanngrisnir and tanngnjóstr  that he eats and resurrects   and is ascribed three dwellings  bilskirnir  þrúðheimr  and þrúðvangr   thor wields the mountain-crushing  hammer  mjölnir  wears the belt megingjörð and the iron gloves járngreipr  and owns the staff gríðarvölr  thor s exploits  including his relentless slaughter of his foes and fierce battles with the monstrous serpent jörmungandr—and their foretold mutual deaths during the events of ragnarök—are recorded throughout sources for norse mythology thor has inspired numerous works of art and references to thor appear in modern popular culture  like other germanic deities  veneration of thor is revived in the modern period in heathenry old norse þórr  old english ðunor  old high german donar  old saxon thunar  and old frisian thuner are cognates within the germanic language branch  descending from the proto-germanic  masculine noun  þunraz name of the god is the origin of the weekday name thursday  by employing a practice known as interpretatio germanica during the roman empire period  the germanic peoples adopted the roman weekly calendar  and replaced the names of roman gods with their own  latin dies iovis   day of jupiter   was converted into proto-germanic   þonares dagaz   thor s day    from which stems modern english  thursday  and all other germanic weekday in the viking age  personal names containing the theonym thórr are recorded with great frequency  prior to the viking age  no examples are recorded  thórr-based  names may have flourished during the viking age as a defiant response to attempts at christianization  similar to the wide scale viking age practice of wearing thor s hammer earliest records of the germanic peoples were recorded by the romans  and in these works thor is frequently referred to—via a process known as interpretatio romana  where characteristics perceived to be similar by romans result in identification of a non-roman  god as a roman deity —as either the roman god jupiter  also known as jove  or the greco-roman  god hercules  the first clear example of this occurs in the roman historian tacitus s late first-century  work germania  where  writing about the religion of the suebi  a confederation of germanic peoples   he comments that  among the gods mercury is the one they principally worship  they regard it as a religious duty to offer to him  on fixed days  human as well as other sacrificial victims  hercules and mars they appease by animal offerings of the permitted kind  and adds that a portion of the suebi also venerate in this instance  tacitus refers to the god odin as  mercury   thor as  hercules   and the god týr as  mars   and the identity of the isis of the suebi has been debated  in thor s case  the identification with the god hercules is likely at least in part due to similarities between thor s hammer and hercules  in his annals  tacitus again refers to the veneration of  hercules  by the germanic peoples  he records a wood beyond the river weser  in what is now northwestern germany  as dedicated to germanic areas occupied by the roman empire  coins and votive objects dating from the 2nd  and 3rd  century ad have been found with latin inscriptions referring to  hercules   and so in reality  with varying levels of likelihood  refer to thor by way of interpretatio first recorded instance of the name of the god appears in the migration period  where a piece of jewelry  a fibula   the nordendorf fibula  dating from the 7th  century ad and found in bavaria  bears an elder futhark inscription that contains the name  þonar   i e   donar   the southern germanic form of the god s to a near-contemporary  account  the christian missionary saint boniface felled an oak tree dedicated to  jove  in the 8th  century  the donar oak in the region of hesse  the second half of the 8th  century  old english mentions of a figure named thunor  þunor  are recorded  a figure who likely refers to an old english version of the god  in relation  thunor is sometimes used in old english texts to gloss jupiter  the god may be referenced in the poem solomon and saturn  where the thunder strikes the devil with a  fiery axe   and the old english expression þunnorad   thunder ride   may refer to the god s thunderous  goat-led  9th-century  ad codex from mainz  germany  known as the old saxon baptismal vow records the name of three old saxon gods  uuôden  old saxon  wodan    saxnôte  and thunaer  by way of their renunciation as demons in a formula to be repeated by germanic pagans formally converting to kentish royal legend  probably 11th-century,  contains the story of a villainous reeve of ecgberht of kent called thunor  who is swallowed up by the earth at a place from then on known as þunores hlæwe  old english  thunor s mound    gabriel turville-petre  saw this as an invented origin for the placename demonstrating loss of memory that thunor had been a god s the 11th  century  chronicler adam of bremen records in his gesta hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum that a statue of thor  who adam describes as  mightiest   sits in the temple at uppsala in the center of a triple throne  flanked by woden and  fricco   located in gamla uppsala  sweden  adam details that  thor  they reckon  rules the sky  he governs thunder and lightning  winds and storms  fine weather and fertility  and that  thor  with his mace  looks like jupiter   adam details that the people of uppsala had appointed priests to each of the gods  and that the priests were to offer up sacrifices  in thor s case  he continues  these sacrifices were done when plague or famine earlier in the same work  adam relays that in 1030  an english preacher  wulfred  was lynched by assembled germanic pagans for  profaning  a representation of objects with runic inscriptions invoking thor date from the 11th  century  one from england and one from sweden  the first  the canterbury charm from canterbury  england  calls upon thor to heal a wound by banishing a the second  the kvinneby amulet  invokes protection by both thor and his the 12th  century  more than a century after norway was  officially  christianized  thor was still being invoked by the population  as evidenced by a stick bearing a runic message found among the bryggen inscriptions in bergen  norway  on the stick  both thor and odin are called upon for help  thor is asked to  receive  the reader  and odin to  own  also around the 12th  century  iconography of the christianizing 11th-century  king olaf ii of norway  saint olaf  absorbed elements of the native thor  olaf ii had become a familiarly red-bearded,  hammer-wielding  the poetic edda  compiled in the 13th  century from traditional source material reaching into the pagan period  thor appears  or is mentioned  in the poems völuspá  grímnismál  skírnismál  hárbarðsljóð  hymiskviða  lokasenna  þrymskviða  alvíssmál  and the poem völuspá  a dead völva recounts the history of the universe and foretells the future to the disguised god odin  including the death of thor  thor  she foretells  will do battle with the great serpent during the immense mythic war waged at ragnarök  and there he will slay the monstrous snake  yet after he will only be able to take nine steps before succumbing to the venom of the beast benjamin thorpe translation henry adams bellows translation afterwards  says the völva  the sky will turn black before fire engulfs the world  the stars will disappear  flames will dance before the sky  steam will rise  the world will be covered in water and then it will be raised again  green and the poem grímnismál  the god odin  in disguise as grímnir  and tortured  starved and thirsty  imparts in the young agnar cosmological lore  including that thor resides in þrúðheimr  and that  every day  thor wades through the rivers körmt and örmt  and the two kerlaugar  there  grímnir says  thor sits as judge at the immense cosmological world tree  skírnismál  the god freyr s messenger  skírnir  threatens the fair gerðr  with whom freyr is smitten  with numerous threats and curses  including that thor  freyr  and odin will be angry with her  and that she risks their  potent is the main character of hárbarðsljóð  where  after traveling  from the east   he comes to an inlet where he encounters a ferryman who gives his name as hárbarðr  odin  again in disguise   and attempts to hail a ride from him  the ferryman  shouting from the inlet  is immediately rude and obnoxious to thor and refuses to ferry him  at first  thor holds his tongue  but hárbarðr only becomes more aggressive  and the poem soon becomes a flyting match between thor and hárbarðr  all the while revealing lore about the two  including thor s killing of several jötnar in  the east  and berzerk women on hlesey  now the danish island of læsø   in the end  thor ends up walking is again the main character in the poem hymiskviða  where  after the gods have been hunting and have eaten their prey  they have an urge to drink  they the twigs  and interpret what they say  the gods decide that they would find suitable cauldrons at ægir s home  thor arrives at ægir s home and finds him to be cheerful  looks into his eyes  and tells him that he must prepare feasts for the gods  annoyed  ægir tells thor that the gods must first bring to him a suitable cauldron to brew ale in  the gods search but find no such cauldron anywhere  however  týr tells thor that he may have a solution  east of élivágar lives hymir  and he owns such a deep after thor secures his goats at egil s home  thor and týr go to hymir s hall in search of a cauldron large enough to brew ale for them all  they arrive  and týr sees his nine-hundred-headed  grandmother and his gold-clad  mother  the latter of which welcomes them with a horn  after hymir—who is not happy to see thor—comes in from the cold outdoors  týr s mother helps them find a properly strong cauldron  thor eats a big meal of two oxen  all the rest eat but one   and then goes to sleep  in the morning  he awakes and informs hymir that he wants to go fishing the following evening  and that he will catch plenty of food  but that he needs bait  hymir tells him to go get some bait from his pasture  which he expects should not be a problem for thor  thor goes out  finds hymir s best ox  and rips its head a lacuna in the manuscript of the poem  hymiskviða abruptly picks up again with thor and hymir in a boat  out at sea  hymir catches a few whales at once  and thor baits his line with the head of the ox  thor casts his line and the monstrous serpent jörmungandr bites  thor pulls the serpent on board  and violently slams him in the head with his hammer  jörmungandr shrieks  and a noisy commotion is heard from underwater before another lacuna appears in the the second lacuna  hymir is sitting in the boat  unhappy and totally silent  as they row back to shore  on shore  hymir suggests that thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm  thor picks both the boat and the whales up  and carries it all back to hymir s farm  after thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at hymir s head on týr s mother s suggestion  thor and týr are given the cauldron  týr cannot lift it  but thor manages to roll it  and so with it they leave  some distance from hymir s home  an army of many-headed  beings led by hymir attacks the two  but are killed by the hammer of thor  although one of his goats is lame in the leg  the two manage to bring the cauldron back  have plenty of ale  and so  from then on  return to ægir s for more every the poem lokasenna  the half-god  loki angrily flyts with the gods in the sea entity ægir s hall  thor does not attend the event  however  as he is away in the east for unspecified purposes  towards the end of the poem  the flyting turns to sif  thor s wife  whom loki then claims to have slept with  the god freyr s servant beyla interjects  and says that  since all of the mountains are shaking  she thinks that thor is on his way home  beyla adds that thor will bring peace to the quarrel  to which loki responds with arrives and tells loki to be silent  and threatens to rip loki s head from his body with his hammer  loki asks thor why he is so angry  and comments that thor will not be so daring to fight  the wolf   fenrir  when it eats odin  a reference to the foretold events of ragnarök   thor again tells him to be silent  and threatens to throw him into the sky  where he will never be seen again  loki says that thor should not brag of his time in the east  as he once crouched in fear in the thumb of a glove  a story involving deception by the magic of útgarða-loki,  recounted in the prose edda book gylfaginning —which  he comments   was hardly like thor   thor again tells him to be silent  threatening to break every bone in loki s body  loki responds that he intends to live a while yet  and again insults thor with references to his encounter with útgarða-loki.  thor responds with a fourth call to be silent  and threatens to send loki to hel  at thor s final threat  loki gives in  commenting that only for thor will he leave the hall  for  i know alone that you do strike   and the poem the comedic poem þrymskviða  thor again plays a central role  in the poem  thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer  mjöllnir  is missing  thor turns to loki  and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen  the two go to the dwelling of the goddess freyja  and so that he may attempt to find mjöllnir  thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak  freyja agrees  and says she would lend it to thor even if it were made of silver or gold  and loki flies off  the feather cloak jötunheimr  the jötunn þrymr sits on a barrow  plaiting golden collars for his female dogs  and trimming the manes of his horses  þrymr sees loki  and asks what could be amiss among the æsir and the elves  why is loki alone in jötunheimr  loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the æsir—that thor s hammer  mjöllnir  is gone  þrymr says that he has hidden mjöllnir eight leagues beneath the earth  from which it will be retrieved  but only if freyja is brought to him as his wife  loki flies off  the feather cloak whistling  away from jötunheimr and back to the court of the asks loki if his efforts were successful  and that loki should tell him while he is still in the air as  tales often escape a sitting man  and the man lying down often barks out lies   loki states that it was indeed an effort  and also a success  for he has discovered that þrymr has the hammer  but that it cannot be retrieved unless freyja is brought to þrymr as his wife  the two return to freyja and tell her to put on a bridal head dress  as they will drive her to jötunheimr  freyja  indignant and angry  goes into a rage  causing all of the halls of the æsir to tremble in her anger  and her necklace  the famed brísingamen  falls from her  freyja pointedly a result  the gods and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter  at the thing  the god heimdallr puts forth the suggestion that  in place of freyja  thor should be dressed as the bride  complete with jewels  women s clothing down to his knees  a bridal head-dress,  and the necklace brísingamen  thor rejects the idea  yet loki interjects that this will be the only way to get back mjöllnir  loki points out that  without mjöllnir  the jötnar will be able to invade and settle in asgard  the gods dress thor as a bride  and loki states that he will go with thor as his maid  and that the two shall drive to jötunheimr riding together in thor s goat-driven  chariot  the two  disguised  arrive in jötunheimr  þrymr commands the jötnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches  for freyja has arrived to be his wife  þrymr recounts his treasured animals and objects  stating that freyja was all that he was missing in his in the evening  the disguised loki and thor meet with þrymr and the assembled jötnar  thor eats and drinks ferociously  consuming entire animals and three casks of mead  þrymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of freyja  and loki  sitting before þrymr and appearing as a  very shrewd maid   makes the excuse that  freyja s  behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive  þrymr then lifts  freyja s  veil and wants to kiss  her   terrifying eyes stare back at him  seemingly burning with fire  loki says that this is because  freyja  has not slept for eight nights in her  wretched sister  of the jötnar appears  asks for a bridal gift from  freyja   and the jötnar bring out mjöllnir to  sanctify the bride   to lay it on her lap  and marry the two by  the hand  of the goddess vár  thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer  takes hold of it  strikes þrymr  beats all of the jötnar  kills their  older sister   and so gets his hammer the poem alvíssmál  thor tricks a dwarf  alvíss  to his doom upon finding that he seeks to wed his daughter  unnamed  possibly þrúðr   as the poem starts  thor meets a dwarf who talks about getting married  thor finds the dwarf repulsive and  apparently  realizes that the bride is his daughter  thor comments that the wedding agreement was made among the gods while thor was gone  and that the dwarf must seek his consent  to do so  thor says  alvíss must tell him what he wants to know about all of the worlds that the dwarf has visited  in a long question and answer session  alvíss does exactly that  he describes natural features as they are known in the languages of various races of beings in the world  and gives an amount of cosmological the question and answer session turns out to be a ploy by thor  as  although thor comments that he has truly never seen anyone with more wisdom in their breast  thor has managed to delay the dwarf enough for the sun to turn him to stone   day dawns on you now  dwarf  now sun shines on the the poem hyndluljóð  freyja offers to the jötunn woman hyndla to blót  sacrifice  to thor so that she may be protected  and comments that thor does not care much for jötunn the prologue to his prose edda  snorri sturluson euhemerises thor as a prince of troy  and the son of king memnon by troana  a daughter of priam  thor  also known as tror  is said to have married the prophetess sibyl  identified with sif   thor is further said here to have been raised in thrace by a chieftain named lorikus  whom he later slew to assume the title of  king of thrace   to have had hair  fairer than gold   and to have been strong enough to lift ten bearskins the name of the aesir is explained as  men from asia   asgard being the  asian city   i e   troy   alternatively  troy is in tyrkland  turkey  i e   asia minor   and asialand is scythia  where thor founded a new city named asgard  odin is a remote descendant of thor  removed by twelve generations  who led an expedition across germany  denmark and sweden to norway in the prose edda  thor is mentioned in all four books  prologue  gylfaginning  skáldskaparmál  and háttatal in heimskringla  composed in the 13th  century by snorri sturluson  thor or statues of thor are mentioned in ynglinga saga  hákonar saga góða  ólafs saga tryggvasonar  and óláfs saga helga  in ynglinga saga chapter 5,  a heavily euhemerized account of the gods is provided  where thor is described as having been a gothi—a pagan priest—who was given by odin  who himself is explained away as having been an exceedingly powerful magic-wielding  chieftain from the east  a dwelling in the mythical location of þrúðvangr  in what is now sweden  the saga narrative adds that numerous names—at the time of the narrative  popularly in use—were derived from about thor  or influenced by native traditions regarding thor  continued into the modern period  particularly in scandinavia  writing in the 19th  century  scholar jacob grimm records various phrases surviving into germanic languages that refer to the god  such as the norwegian thorsvarme   thor s warmth   for lightning and the swedish godgubben åfar   the good old  fellow  is taking a ride   as well as the word tordön   thor s rumble  or  thor s thunder   when it thunders  grimm comments that  at times  scandinavians often  no longer liked to utter the god s real name  or they wished to extol his fatherly goodness remained pictured as a red-bearded  figure  as evident by the danish rhyme that yet referred to him as thor med sit lange skæg   thor with the long beard   and the north-frisian  curse diis ruadhiiret donner regiir    let red-haired  thunder see to scandinavian folk belief that lightning frightens away trolls and jötnar appears in numerous scandinavian folktales  and may be a late reflection of

the hindu indra  whose red hair and thunderbolt weapon the vajra are obvious parallels  scholars have compared indra s slaying of vritra with thor s battle with although in the past it was suggested

the functions of indra have been in effect taken over by many scholars have noted the association of thor with fertility  particularly in later folklore and in the reflex of him represented by the sami hora galles ("good-man  thor    for dumézil  this is the preservation by peasants of only the side-effect  of the god s atmospheric battles  the fertilizing others have emphasized thor s close connection to humanity  in all its scholar hilda ellis davidson summarizes the cult of thor was linked up with men s habitation and possessions  and with well-being  of the family and community  this included the fruitfulness of the fields  and thor  although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths  was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round  in our own times  little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring  thor s marriage with sif of the golden hair  about which we hear little in the myths  seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess  when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile  in this way thor  as well as odin  may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the bronze modern times  thor continues to be referred to in popular culture  starting with f  j  klopstock s 1776  ode to thor  wir und sie  thor has been the subject of poems in several languages  including adam gottlob
