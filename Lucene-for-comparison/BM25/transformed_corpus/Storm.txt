 storm -  wikipediaa storm is any disturbed state of an environment or astronomical body s atmosphere especially affecting its surface  and strongly implying severe weather  it may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong wind  tornados  hail  thunder and lightning  a thunderstorm   heavy precipitation  snowstorm  rainstorm   heavy freezing rain  ice storm   strong winds  tropical cyclone  windstorm   or wind transporting some substance through the atmosphere as in a dust storm  blizzard  sandstorm  etc storms have the potential to harm lives and property via storm surge  heavy rain or snow causing flooding or road impassibility  lightning  wildfires  and vertical wind shear  however  systems with significant rainfall and duration help alleviate drought in places they move through  heavy snowfall can allow special recreational activities to take place which would not be possible otherwise  such as skiing and snowmobiling the english word comes from proto-germanic   sturmaz meaning  noise  are created when a center of low pressure develops with a system of high pressure surrounding it  this combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm clouds  such as the cumulonimbus  small localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground  resulting in smaller disturbances such as dust devils and whirlwinds there are many varieties and names for storms a strict meteorological definition of a terrestrial storm is a wind measuring 10  or higher on the beaufort scale  meaning a wind speed of 24.5  m s (89  km h  55  mph  or more  however  popular usage is not so restrictive  storms can last anywhere from 12  to 200  hours  depending on season and geography  in north america  the east and northeast storms are noted for the most frequent repeatability and duration  especially during the cold period  big terrestrial storms alter the oceanographic conditions that in turn may affect food abundance and distribution  strong currents  strong tides  increased siltation  change in water temperatures  overturn in the water column  etc storms do not only occur on earth  other planetary bodies with a sufficient atmosphere  gas giants in particular  also undergo stormy weather  the great red spot on jupiter provides a well-known  example  though technically an anticyclone with greater than hurricane wind speeds  it is larger than the earth and has persisted for at least 340  years  having first been observed by astronomer galileo galilei  neptune also had its own lesser-known  great dark spot in september 1994  the hubble telescope – using wide field planetary camera 2  – imaged storms on saturn generated by upwelling of warmer air  similar to a terrestrial thunderhead  the east-west  extent of the needed  storm equalled the diameter of earth  the storm was observed earlier in september 1990  and acquired the name dragon storm the dust storms of mars vary in size  but can often cover the entire planet  they tend to occur when mars comes closest to the sun  and have been shown to increase the global particularly large martian storm was exhaustively studied up close due to coincidental timing  when the first spacecraft to successfully orbit another planet  mariner 9,  arrived and successfully orbited mars on 14  november 1971,  planetary scientists were surprised to find the atmosphere was thick with a planet-wide  robe of dust  the largest storm ever observed on mars  the surface of the planet was totally obscured  mariner 9's  computer was reprogrammed from earth to delay imaging of the surface for a couple of months until the dust settled  however  the surface-obscured  images contributed much to the collection of mars atmospheric and planetary surface extrasolar planets are known to have storms  hd 209458  and hd 80606  b  the former s storm was discovered on june 23,  2010  and measured at 6,200  km h  while the latter produces winds of 17,700  kilometers (11,000  mi  per hour across the surface  the spin of the planet then creates giant swirling shock-wave  storms that carry the heat are common with the passage of strong tropical cyclones  such shipwrecks can change the course of as well as influence art and literature  a hurricane led to a victory of the spanish over the french for control of fort caroline  and ultimately the atlantic coast of north america  in winds from any storm type can damage or destroy vehicles  buildings  bridges  and other outside objects  turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles  in the united states  major hurricanes comprise just 21%  of all landfalling tropical cyclones  but account for 83%  of all tropical cyclones often knock out power to tens or hundreds of thousands of people  preventing vital communication and hampering rescue tropical cyclones often destroy key bridges  overpasses  and roads  complicating efforts to transport food  clean water  and medicine to the areas that need it  furthermore  the damage caused by tropical cyclones to buildings and dwellings can result in economic damage to a region  and to a diaspora of the population of the storm surge  or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone  is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones  historically resulting in 90%  of tropical cyclone the relatively quick surge in sea level can move miles kilometers inland  flooding homes and cutting off escape routes  the storm surges and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made  structures  but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries  which are typically important fish breeding locales.cloud-to-ground  lightning frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations  one of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of under a regime of low precipitation  lp  thunderstorms  where little precipitation is present  rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme wildfires can devastate vegetation and the biodiversity of an ecosystem  wildfires that occur close to urban environments can inflict damages upon infrastructures  buildings  crops  and provide risks to explosions  should the flames be exposed to gas pipes  direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on in areas with a high frequency for cloud-to-ground  lightning  like florida  lightning causes several fatalities per year  most commonly to people working with low potential of hydrogen levels  ph   otherwise known as acid rain  is also a frequent risk produced by lightning  distilled water  which contains no carbon dioxide  has a neutral ph of 7.  liquids with a ph less than 7  are acidic  and those with a ph greater than 7  are bases  “clean” or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic ph of about 5.2,  because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid  a weak acid  ph 5.6  in distilled water   but unpolluted rain also contains other nitric oxide present during thunderstorm caused by the splitting of nitrogen molecules  can result in the production of acid rain  if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation  thus creating acid rain  acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or other solid chemical compounds containing carbon  in ecosystems  acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in soil  resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial damage to roofs often goes unnoticed until further structural damage is seen  such as leaks or cracks  it is hardest to recognize hail damage on shingled roofs and flat roofs  but all roofs have their own hail damage detection metal roofs are fairly resistant to hail damage  but may accumulate cosmetic damage in the form of dents and damaged hail is also a common nuisance to drivers of automobiles  severely denting the vehicle and cracking or even shattering windshields and windows  rarely  massive hailstones have been known to cause concussions or fatal head trauma  hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history  one of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 9th  century in roopkund  uttarakhand  the largest hailstone in terms of diameter and weight ever recorded in the united states fell on july 23,  2010  in vivian  south dakota in the united states  it measured 8  inches (20  cm  in diameter and 18.62  inches (47.3  cm  in circumference  weighing in at 1.93  pounds (0.88  this broke the previous record for diameter set by a hailstone 7  inches diameter and 18.75  inches circumference which fell in aurora  nebraska in the united states on june 22,  2003,  as well as the record for weight  set by a hailstone of 1.67  pounds (0.76  kg  that fell in coffeyville  kansas in hazards  ranging from hail to lightning can affect outside technology facilities  such as antennas  satellite dishes  and towers  as a result  companies with outside facilities have begun installing such facilities underground  in order to reduce the risk of damage from snowfall can disrupt public infrastructure and services  slowing human activity even in regions that are accustomed to such weather  air and ground transport may be greatly inhibited or shut down entirely  populations living in snow-prone  areas have developed various ways to travel across the snow  such as skis  snowshoes  and sleds pulled by horses  dogs  or other animals and later  snowmobiles  basic utilities such as electricity  telephone lines  and gas supply can also fail  in addition  snow can make roads much harder to travel and vehicles attempting to use them can easily become combined effects can lead to a  snow day  on which gatherings such as school  work  or church are officially canceled  in areas that normally have very little or no snow  a snow day may occur when there is only light accumulation or even the threat of snowfall  since those areas are unprepared to handle any amount of snow  in some areas  such as some states in the united states  schools are given a yearly quota of snow days  or  calamity days    once the quota is exceeded  the snow days must be made in other states  all snow days must be made for example  schools may extend the remaining school days later into the afternoon  shorten spring break  or delay the start of summer vacation accumulated snow is removed to make travel easier and safer  and to decrease the long-term  effect of a heavy snowfall  this process utilizes shovels and snowplows  and is often assisted by sprinkling salt or other chloride-based  chemicals  which reduce the melting temperature of in some areas with abundant snowfall  such as yamagata prefecture  japan  people harvest snow and store it surrounded by insulation in ice houses  this allows the snow to be used through the summer for refrigeration and air conditioning  which requires far less electricity than traditional cooling can cause serious damage  notably to automobiles  aircraft  skylights  glass-roofed  structures  livestock  and most commonly  farmers  wheat  corn  soybeans  and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail hail is one of canada s most expensive snowfall can be beneficial to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator  conserving the heat of the earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather  some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring  providing water for crop growth  if it melts into water and refreezes upon sensitive crops  such as oranges  the resulting ice will protect the fruit from exposure to lower although tropical cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property  they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they affect and bring much-needed  precipitation to otherwise dry regions  hurricanes in the eastern north pacific often supply moisture to the southwestern united states and parts of japan receives over half of its rainfall from hurricane camille averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its though it also killed 259  people and caused $9.14  billion (2005  usd  in damage hail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to when hail stones exceed 0.5  inches (13  mm  in diameter  planes can be seriously damaged within the hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft  strong wind outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three-dimensional  wind velocity just above ground level  initially  this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed  which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear  as the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft  the localized headwind diminishes  reducing the aircraft s airspeed and increasing its sink rate  then  when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft  the headwind becomes a tailwind  reducing lift generated by the wings  and leaving the aircraft in a low-power,  low-speed  descent  this can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact  as the result of the accidents in the 1970s  and 1980s,  in 1988  the u s  federal aviation administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board  wind shear detection systems by 1993.  between 1964  and 1985,  wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26  major civil transport aircraft accidents in the u s  that led to 620  deaths and 200  injuries  since 1995,  the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years  due to the mandated on-board  detection as well as the addition of doppler weather radar units on the ground  winter sports  such as and snowshoeing depend upon snow  where snow is scarce but the temperature is low enough  snow cannons may be used to produce an adequate amount for such children and adults can play on a sled or ride in a sleigh  although a person s footsteps remain a visible lifeline within a snow-covered  landscape  snow cover is considered a general danger to hiking since the snow obscures landmarks and makes the landscape itself appear to the bible  a giant storm sent by god flooded the earth  noah and his family and the animals entered the ark  and  the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up  and the windows of heaven were opened  and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights   the flood covered even the highest mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet  and all creatures died  only noah and those with him on the ark were left alive  in the new testament  jesus christ is recorded to have calmed a storm on the sea of galilee the gilgamesh flood myth is a deluge story in the epic of gilgamesh in greek mythology there were several gods of storms  briareos  the god of sea storms  aigaios  a god of the violent sea storms  and aiolos  keeper of storm-winds,  squalls and tempests the sea venture was wrecked near bermuda in 1609,  which led to the colonization of and provided the inspiration for shakespeare s play the specifically  sir thomas gates  future governor of virginia  was on his way to england from jamestown  virginia  on saint james day  while he was between cuba and the bahamas  a hurricane raged for nearly two days  though one of the small vessels in the fleet sank to the bottom of the florida straits  seven of the remaining vessels reached virginia within several days after the storm  the flagship of the fleet  known as sea adventure  disappeared and was presumed lost  a small bit of fortune befell the ship and her crew when they made landfall on bermuda  the vessel was damaged on a surrounding coral reef  but all aboard survived for nearly a year on the island  the british colonists claimed the island and quickly settled bermuda  in may 1610,  they set forth for jamestown  this time arriving at their destination the children s novel the wonderful wizard of oz  written by l  frank baum and illustrated by w  w  denslow  chronicles the adventures of a young girl named dorothy gale in the land of oz  after being swept away from her kansas farm home by a tornado  the story was originally published by the george m  hill company in chicago on may 17,  1900  and has since been reprinted numerous times  most often under the name the wizard of oz  and adapted for use in other media  thanks in part to the 1939  mgm movie  it is one of the best-known  stories in american popular culture and has been widely translated  its initial success  and the success of the popular 1902  broadway musical which baum adapted from his original story  led to baum s writing thirteen more oz books hollywood director king vidor  february 8,  1894  – november 1,  1982)  survived the galveston hurricane of 1900  as a boy  based on that experience  he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone  titled  southern storm   for the may 1935  issue of esquire magazine  erik larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 2005  book  isaac s other accounts of the galveston hurricane of 1900  have been made in print and in film  larson cites many of them in isaac s storm  which centrally features that storm  as well as chronicles the creation of the weather bureau  which came to known as the national weather service  and that agency s fateful rivalry with the weather service in cuba  and a number of other major storms  such as those which ravaged indianola  texas in 1875  and great storm of 1987  is key in an important scene near the end of possession  a romance  the bestselling and man booker prize-winning  novel by a  s  byatt  the great storm of 1987  occurred on the night of october 15–16,  1987,  when an unusually strong weather system caused winds to hit much of southern england and northern france  it was the worst storm to hit england since the great storm of (284  years earlier  and was responsible for the deaths of at least 22  people in england and france combined (18  in england  at least four in katrina (2005)  has been featured in a number of works of fiction the romantic seascape painters j  m  w  turner and ivan aivazovsky created some of the most lasting impressions of the sublime and stormy seas that are firmly imprinted on the popular mind  turner s representations of powerful natural forces reinvented the traditional seascape during the first half of the nineteenth century upon his travels to holland  he took note of the familiar large rolling waves of the english seashore transforming into the sharper  choppy waves of a dutch storm  a characteristic example of turner’s dramatic seascape is the slave ship of 1840.  aivazovsky left several thousand turbulent canvases in which he increasingly eliminated human figures and historical background to focus on such essential elements as light  sea  and sky  his grandiose ninth wave (1850)  is an ode to human daring in the face of the elements the 1926  silent film the johnstown flood features the great flood of 1889  in johnstown  pennsylvania  the flood  caused by the catastrophic failure of the south fork dam after days of extremely heavy rainfall  prompted the first major disaster relief effort by the american red cross  directed by clara barton  the johnstown flood was depicted in numerous other media  both fictional and in non-fiction),  as well warner
