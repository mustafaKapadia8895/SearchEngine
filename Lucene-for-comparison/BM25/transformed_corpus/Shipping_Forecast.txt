broadcast by bbc radio 4  on behalf of the maritime and coastguard agency  the forecasts sent over the navtex system use a similar format and the same sea areas  the waters around the british isles are divided into 31  sea areas  also known as weather areas  see map there are four broadcasts per day at the following  uk local  times the unique and distinctive sound of these broadcasts has led to their attracting an audience much wider than that directly interested in maritime weather conditions  in august 2017,  radio 4  celebrated the service s 150th  october 1859,  the steam clipper royal charter was wrecked in a strong storm off anglesey  450  people lost their lives  due to this loss  vice-admiral  robert fitzroy introduced a warning service for shipping in february 1861,  using telegraph communications  this remained the united kingdom s met office primary responsibility for some time afterwards  in 1911,  the met office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around great britain  this service was discontinued during and following the first world war  between 1914  and june 1921,  and again during the second world war between 1939  and although most ships have onboard technology to provide the forecast s information  they still use it to check their friday 30  may 2014,  for the first time in more than 90  years  the bbc failed to broadcast the shipping forecast at 0520.  staff at broadcasting house were reading out the report but it was not transmitted  listeners instead heard bbc world

above by 1949.  in 1955,  meteorologists from countries with north sea coastlines met and recommended that the uk s sea area  heligoland  be renamed  german bight  to reflect more general usage amongst the nations concerned  they also recommended the divisions of  dogger   with the north-eastern  portion to be named  fisher   and  forties   with the northern half becoming  viking    and the renaming of  iceland  as 'south-east  iceland  for greater clarity  following international consultation  these changes were introduced in around 1983,  the minches sea area was merged with needed  in august 1984,  the areas in the north sea were again coordinated with those of neighbouring countries  introducing north utsire and south and reducing viking in size  finisterre was renamed fitzroy in 2002,  to avoid confusion with the smaller sea area of the same name used in the marine forecasts produced by the french and spanish meteorological some names still differ  for example  the dutch knmi names the area equivalent to forties after the fladen bank  while météo-france  calls the english channel sea areas dover  wight  portland  and plymouth respectively pas de calais  antifer  casquets  and the forecast  areas are named in a roughly clockwise direction  strictly following the order above  however  a forecast for trafalgar is found only in the 0048  forecast – other forecasts do

stations  which are known by their names  such as  channel light vessel automatic   these are the coastal weather stations  this additional information does not fall within the 350/380  word restriction   rté radio 1  broadcasts similar coastal reports for ireland  the extended forecast also includes an inshore waters forecast in addition  gale warnings are broadcast at other times between programmes and after news  the bbc instruction reads   gale warnings shall be radiated  broadcast  during the next available programme junction and repeated at the end of the following news bulletin   for example that was the news  and now attention all shipping  especially in sea areas german bight and humber  the met office issued the following gale warning to shipping at 2206  today

will indicate when it expects the gale to occur   imminent  means that a gale is expected within 6  hours   expected soon  that a gale is expected within 6  to 12  hours and  later  in more than 12  hours  time the shipping forecast is broadcast on bbc radio 4  because its longwave signal can be received clearly at sea all around the british isles regardless of time of day or radio conditions  for the same reason  the shipping forecast was broadcast in the bbc national programme until september 1939,  and then after the second world war on the bbc light programme  later bbc radio 2)  until november 1978:  these services were all broadcast on longwave  when bbc radio 4  took over the longwave frequency from radio 2  on 23  november 1978,  the shipping forecast moved to radio 4.the  last broadcast of the shipping forecast at 0048  each day is traditionally preceded by the playing of  sailing by   a light orchestral piece by ronald binge  this is only very rarely omitted  generally when the schedule is running late  though occasionally played in full  it is common for only a section of the piece to be broadcast  that section being the length required to fill the gap between the previous programme s ending and the start of the forecast at precisely more importantly   sailing by  serves as a vital identification tool – it is distinctive and as such assists anyone attempting to tune in  the forecast is then followed by the national anthem and the closedown of the station for the day  with the bbc world service taking over the frequencies after the pips of the greenwich time signal at 0100.the  shipping forecast should not be confused with similar broadcasts given by hm coastguard to vessels at sea tuned into marine vhf and mf radio frequencies hm coastguard s broadcasts can only be heard by vessels or persons using or tuned into marine vhf and mf radio frequencies  whereas the shipping forecast can be heard by anyone tuned into bbc radio 4.the  coastguard s broadcasts follow the same format as the shipping forecast using the same terminology and style  but the information only normally applies to the area sector or region covered by that particular coastguard co-ordination  centre  such as the bristol channel  for instance  announcements of pending broadcasts by hmcg is given on marine channel 16  vhf and is normally announced along the lines of  all stations  this is portland coastguard    maritime safety information will now be broadcast on channel 23...  portland coastguard  a similar broadcast on mf is initially announced on 2182  khz

allowing ships in the atlantic ocean and north sea to receive the broadcast on 18  december 1993,  as part of the arena radio night  bbc radio 4  and bbc 2  collaborated on a simultaneous broadcast so
