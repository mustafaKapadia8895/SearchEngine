 lifted index -  wikipediathe lifted index  li  is the temperature difference between the environment te p  and an air parcel lifted adiabatically tp p  at a given pressure height in the troposphere  lowest layer where most weather occurs  of the atmosphere  usually 500  hpa  mb   the temperature is measured in celsius  when the value is positive  the atmosphere  at the respective height  is stable and when the value is negative  the atmosphere is unstable li can be computed using computer algorithms but can also be determined graphically  to do this  generally  the parcel is lifted from the portion of the planetary boundary layer  pbl  that lies below the morning inversion  the air here should be about 60  to 65%  rh  which is then lifted along the dry adiabat  see also adiabatic process  to the lifting condensation level  lcl   which is the intersection of that curve with the average mixing ratio in the boundary layer  once the lcl is found  the parcel is lifted along the moist adiabat to 500  mb  it is then that one finds li   te p  -  tp p  li is generally scaled as follows the lifted index can be used in thunderstorm forecasting  however  convective available potential energy  cape  is considered by most as a superior measurement of instability and is preferred by many meteorologists for convection however  li is easier and faster to determine without using a computer  as determining cape requires integration from one level to another
