 sand eel -  wikipediasand eel or sandeel is the common name used for a considerable number of species of fish  most of them are sea fish of the genera hyperoplus  greater sand eels   gymnammodytes or ammodytes  many species are found off the western coasts of europe from spain to scotland  and in the mediterranean and baltic seas the three genera listed above all fall within the family ammodytidae  the sand lances  members of these genera found in other oceans are not usually called sand eels  and species from other parts of the world are known as sand eels are usually less closely related  none of the sand eels is related to the true eels sand eels are an important food source for seabirds  including puffins and kittiwakes a preferential habitat is a seabed floor  with a relatively smooth bottom of gravelly sand  an example of this prime habitat is the floor of the sea of the sand eels typically burrow in the sand to escape from predators traditionally  they have been little exploited for human food  but are a major target of industrial fishing for animal feed and fertilizer  increasing fishing for them is thought to be causing problems for some of their natural predators  especially the auks which take them in deeper water  they are also tied as flies to catch fish an instance of this was the rspb report linking a population crash of seabirds in the north sea to fishing for sand eels  this led to political pressure for the closure of this fishery  the seabird populations subsequently improved  however  a second population crash of seabirds which occurred with no effect on the stocks of sand eel  cast doubt on this needed
