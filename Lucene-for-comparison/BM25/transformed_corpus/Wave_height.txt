 wave height -  wikipediain fluid dynamics  the wave height of a surface wave is the difference between the elevations of a crest and a neighbouring wave height is a term used by mariners  as well as in coastal  ocean and naval engineering at sea  the term significant wave height is used as a means to introduce a well-defined  and standardized statistic to denote the characteristic height of the random waves in a sea state  it is defined in such a way that it more–or–less corresponds to what a mariner observes when estimating visually the average wave height
