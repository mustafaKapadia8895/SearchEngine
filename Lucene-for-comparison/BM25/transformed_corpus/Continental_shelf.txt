 continental shelf -  wikipediathe continental shelf is an underwater landmass which extends from a continent  resulting in an area of relatively shallow water known as a shelf sea  much of the shelves were exposed during glacial periods and interglacial periods the shelf surrounding an island is known as an insular shelf the continental margin  between the continental shelf and the abyssal plain  comprises a steep continental slope followed by the flatter continental rise  sediment from the continent above cascades down the slope and accumulates as a pile of sediment at the base of the slope  called the continental rise  extending as far as 500  km (310  mi  from the slope  it consists of thick sediments deposited by turbidity currents from the shelf and the continental rise s gradient is intermediate between the slope and the shelf  on the order of the united nations convention on the law of the sea  the name continental shelf was given a legal definition as the stretch of the seabed adjacent to the shores of a particular country to which it belongs the width of the continental shelf varies considerably – it is not uncommon for an area to have virtually no shelf at all  particularly where the forward edge of an advancing oceanic plate dives beneath continental crust in an offshore subduction zone such as off the coast of chile or the west coast of sumatra  the largest shelf – the siberian shelf in the arctic ocean – stretches to 1,500  kilometers (930  mi  in width  the south china sea lies over another extensive area of continental shelf  the sunda shelf  which joins borneo  sumatra  and java to the asian mainland  other familiar bodies of water that overlie continental shelves are the north sea and the persian gulf  the average width of continental shelves is about 80  km (50  mi   the depth of the shelf also varies  but is generally limited to water shallower than 150  m (490  the slope of the shelf is usually quite low  on the order of 0.5°;  vertical relief is also minimal  at less than 20  m (66  the continental shelf is treated as a physiographic province of the ocean  it is not part of the deep ocean basin proper  but the flooded margins of the passive continental margins such as most of the atlantic coasts have wide and shallow shelves  made of thick sedimentary wedges derived from long erosion of a neighboring continent  active continental margins have narrow  relatively steep shelves  due to frequent earthquakes that move sediment to the deep shelf usually ends at a point of increasing  called the shelf break   the sea floor below the break is the continental slope  below the slope is the continental rise  which finally merges into the deep ocean floor  the abyssal plain  the continental shelf and the slope are part of the continental margin the shelf area is commonly subdivided into the inner continental shelf  mid continental shelf  and outer continental shelf  each with their specific geomorphology and marine biology the character of the shelf changes dramatically at the shelf break  where the continental slope begins  with a few exceptions  the shelf break is located at a remarkably uniform depth of roughly 140  m (460  ft   this is likely a hallmark of past ice ages  when sea level was lower than it is continental slope is much steeper than the shelf  the average angle is 3°,  but it can be as low as 1°  or as high as the slope is often cut with submarine canyons  the physical mechanisms involved in forming these canyons were not well understood until the continental shelves are covered by terrigenous sediments  that is  those derived from erosion of the continents  however  little of the sediment is from current rivers  some 60–70%  of the sediment on the world s shelves is relict sediment  deposited during the last ice age  when sea level was 100–120  m lower than it is usually become increasingly fine with distance from the coast  sand is limited to shallow  wave-agitated  waters  while silt and clays are deposited in quieter  deep water far these accumulate 15–40  cm every millennium  much faster than deep-sea  pelagic shelves teem with life  because of the sunlight available in shallow waters  in contrast to the biotic desert of the oceans  abyssal plain  the pelagic  water column  environment of the continental shelf constitutes the neritic zone  and the benthic  sea floor  province of the shelf is the sublittoral the shelves are usually fertile  if anoxic conditions prevail during sedimentation  the deposits may over geologic time become sources for fossil fuels the relatively accessible continental shelf is the best understood part of the ocean floor  most commercial exploitation from the sea  such as metallic-ore,  non-metallic  ore  and hydrocarbon extraction  takes place on the continental shelf  sovereign rights over their continental shelves up to a depth of 200  metres or to a distance where the depth of waters admitted of resource exploitation were claimed by the marine nations that signed the convention on the continental shelf drawn up by the un s international law commission in 1958.  this was partly superseded by the 1982  united nations convention on the law of the which created the 200  nautical mile exclusive economic zone and extended continental shelf rights for states with physical continental shelves that extend beyond that distance the legal definition of a continental shelf differs significantly from the geological definition  unclos states that the shelf extends to the limit of the continental margin  but no less than 200  nautical miles from the baseline  thus inhabited volcanic islands such as the canaries  which have no actual continental shelf  nonetheless have a legal continental shelf  whereas uninhabitable islands have no shelf
