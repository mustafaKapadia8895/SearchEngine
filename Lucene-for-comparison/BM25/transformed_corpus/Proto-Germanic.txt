 proto-germanic  language -  wikipediaproto-germanic   abbreviated pgmc  german urgermanisch  also called common germanic  german gemeingermanisch  is the reconstructed proto-language  of the germanic branch of the indo-european  languages.proto-germanic  developed from pre-proto-germanic  into three branches during the first half of the first millennium of the common era  west germanic  east germanic and north germanic  which however remained in contact over a considerable time  especially the ingvaeonic languages  including english   which arose from west germanic dialects which remained in continued contact with north germanic a defining feature of proto-germanic  is the completion of grimm s law  a set of sound changes that occurred between its status as a dialect of proto-indo-european  and its gradual divergence into a separate language  as it is probable that the development of this sound shift spanned a considerable time  several centuries   proto-germanic  cannot adequately be reconstructed as a simple node in a tree model but rather represents a phase of development that may span close to a thousand years  the end of the common germanic period is reached with the beginning of the migration period in the fourth century the alternative term  germanic parent language  may be used to include a larger scope of linguistic developments  spanning the nordic bronze age and pre-roman  iron age in northern europe  second to first millennia bc  to include "pre-germanic"   pregmc    early proto germanic   epgmc  and  late proto-germanic"  while proto-germanic  refers only to the most recent reconstruction of the common ancestor of germanic languages  the germanic parent language refers to the entire journey that the dialect of proto-indo-european  that would become proto-germanic  underwent through the millennia the proto-germanic  language is not directly attested by any coherent surviving texts  it has been reconstructed using the comparative method  fragmentary direct attestation exists of  late  common germanic in early runic inscriptions  specifically the second-century  ad vimose inscriptions and the second-century  bc negau helmet and in roman empire era transcriptions of individual words  notably in tacitus  germania  c  90  proto-germanic  language developed in southern scandinavia  denmark  south sweden and southern norway   the urheimat  original home  of the germanic it is possible that indo-european  speakers first arrived in southern scandinavia with the corded ware culture in the mid-3rd  millennium bc  developing into the nordic bronze age cultures by the early 2nd  millennium proto-germanic  developed out of pre-proto-germanic  during the pre-roman  iron age of northern europe  according to the germanic substrate hypothesis  it may be influenced by non-indo-european  cultures  such as the funnelbeaker culture  but the sound change in the germanic languages known as grimm s law points to a non-substratic  development away from other branches of 1]  proto-germanic  itself was likely spoken after c  500  and proto-norse  from the 2nd  century ad and later is still quite close to reconstructed proto-germanic,  but other common innovations separating germanic from proto-indo-european  suggest a common history of pre-proto-germanic  speakers throughout the nordic

loanwords in proto-germanic  have been by the 1st  century ad  germanic expansion reaches the danube and the upper rhine in the south  and the germanic peoples first enter the historical record  at about the same time  extending east of the vistula  oksywie culture  przeworsk culture   germanic speakers come into contact with early slavic cultures  as reflected in early germanic loans in proto-slavic.by  the 3rd  century  lpgmc speakers had expanded over significant distance  from the rhine to the dniepr spanning about 1,200  km (700  mi   the period marks the breakup of late proto-germanic  and the beginning of the (historiographically-recorded)  germanic migrations  the first coherent text recorded in a germanic language is the gothic bible  written in the later 4th  century in the language of the thervingi gothic christians  who had escaped persecution by moving from scythia to moesia in 348.the  earliest coherent text  complete sentences including verbs  in proto-norse  become available c  400  in runic inscriptions  such as the tune runestone   the delineation of late common germanic from proto-norse  about then is largely a matter of convention  early west germanic becomes available in the 5th  century with the frankish bergakker inscription the evolution of proto-germanic  from its ancestral forms  beginning with its ancestor proto-indo-european,  began with the development of a separate common way of speech among some geographically nearby speakers of a prior language and ended with the dispersion of the proto-language  speakers into distinct populations with mostly independent speech habits  between the two points  many sound changes occurred phylogeny as applied to historical linguistics involves the evolutionary descent of languages  the phylogeny problem is the question of what specific tree  in the tree model of language evolution  best explains the paths of descent of all the members of a language family from a common language  or proto-language   at the root of the tree  to the attested languages  at the leaves of the tree   the germanic languages form a tree with proto-germanic  at its root that is a branch of the indo-european  tree  which in turn has proto-indo-european  at its root  borrowing of lexical items from contact languages makes the relative position of the germanic branch within indo-european  less clear than the positions of the other branches of indo-european.  in the course of the development of historical linguistics  various solutions have been proposed  none certain and all debatable in the evolutionary history of a language family  philologists consider a genetic  tree model  appropriate only if communities do not remain in effective contact as their languages diverge  early indo-european  had limited contact between distinct lineages  and  uniquely  the germanic subfamily exhibited a less treelike behaviour  as some of its characteristics were acquired from neighbours early in its evolution rather than from its direct ancestors  the internal diversification of west germanic developed in an especially non-treelike  is generally agreed to have begun about 500  its hypothetical ancestor between the end of proto-indo-european  and 500  bc is termed pre-proto-germanic.  whether it is to be included under a wider meaning of proto-germanic  is a matter of usage winfred p  lehmann regarded jacob grimm s  first germanic sound shift   or grimm s law  and verner s  which pertained mainly to consonants and were considered for many decades to have generated proto-germanic)  as pre-proto-germanic  and held that the  upper boundary  was the fixing of the accent  or stress  on the root syllable of a word  typically on the first proto-indo-european  had featured a moveable pitch-accent  comprising  an alternation of high and low as well as stress of position determined by a set of rules based on the lengths of a word s syllables the fixation of the stress led to sound changes in unstressed syllables  for lehmann  the  lower boundary  was the dropping of final -a  or -e  in unstressed syllables  for example  post-pie  *wóyd-e    gothic wait   knows   antonsen agreed with lehmann about the upper but later found runic evidence that the -a  was not dropped  ékwakraz … wraita   i  wakraz  … wrote  this    he says   we must therefore search for a new lower boundary for own scheme divides proto-germanic  into an early stage and a late stage  the early stage includes the stress fixation and resulting  spontaneous vowel-shifts"  while the late stage is defined by ten complex rules governing changes of both vowels and 250  bc proto-germanic  had branched into five groups of germanic  two each in the west and the north and one in the following changes are known or presumed to have occurred in the history of proto-germanic  in the wider sense from the end of proto-indo-european  up to the point that proto-germanic  began to break into mutually unintelligible dialects  the changes are listed roughly in chronological order  with changes that operate on the outcome of earlier ones appearing later in the list  the stages distinguished and the changes associated with each stage rely heavily on ringe 2006,  chapter 3,   the development of proto-germanic".  ringe in turn summarizes standard concepts and terminology this stage began with the separation of a distinct speech  perhaps while it was still forming part of the proto-indo-european  dialect continuum  it contained many innovations that were shared with other indo-european  branches to various degrees  probably through areal contacts  and mutual intelligibility with other dialects would have remained for some time  it was nevertheless on its own path  whether dialect or language this stage began its evolution as a dialect of proto-indo-european  that had lost its laryngeals and had five long and six short vowels as well as one or two overlong vowels  the consonant system was still that of pie minus palatovelars and laryngeals  but the loss of syllabic resonants already made the language markedly different from pie proper  mutual intelligibility might have still existed with other descendants of pie  but it would have been strained  and the period marked the definitive break of germanic from the other indo-european  languages and the beginning of germanic proper  containing most of the sound changes that are now held to define this branch distinctively  this stage contained various consonant and vowel shifts  the loss of the contrastive accent inherited from pie for a uniform accent on the first syllable of the word root  and the beginnings of the reduction of the resulting unstressed syllables by this stage  germanic had emerged as a distinctive branch and had undergone many of the sound changes that would make its later descendants recognisable as germanic languages  it had shifted its consonant inventory from a system that was rich in plosives to one containing primarily fricatives  had lost the pie mobile pitch accent for a predictable stress accent  and had merged two of its vowels  the stress accent had already begun to cause the erosion of unstressed syllables  which would continue in its descendants  the final stage of the language included the remaining development until the breakup into dialects and  most notably  featured the development of nasal vowels and the start of umlaut  another characteristic germanic feature loans into proto-germanic  from other  known  languages or from proto-germanic  into other languages can be dated relative to each other by which germanic sound laws have acted on them  since the dates of borrowings and sound laws are not precisely known  it is not possible to use loans to establish absolute or calendar chronology most loans from celtic appear to have been made before or during the germanic sound for instance  one specimen  rīks  ruler  was borrowed from celtic  rīxs  king   stem *rīg-),  with g → it is clearly not native because pie  ē → ī is typical of not germanic but celtic languages  another is  walhaz  foreigner  celt  from the celtic tribal name volcae with k → h and o → a  other likely celtic loans include  ambahtaz  servant    brunjǭ  mailshirt    gīslaz  hostage    īsarną  iron    lēkijaz  healer    laudą  lead    rīnaz  rhine   and  tūnaz  tūną  fortified these loans would likely have been borrowed during the celtic hallstatt and early la tène cultures when the celts dominated central europe  although the period

numerous loanwords believed to have been borrowed from proto-germanic  are known in the non-germanic  languages spoken in areas adjacent to the germanic languages the heaviest influence has been on

also known the term substrate with reference to proto-germanic  refers to lexical items and phonological elements that do not appear to be descended from proto-indo-european.  the substrate theory postulates that the elements came from an earlier population that stayed amongst the indo-europeans  and was influential enough to bring over some elements of its own language  the theory of a non-indo-european  substrate was first proposed by sigmund feist  who estimated that about a third of all proto-germanic  lexical items came from the 2]theo  vennemann has hypothesized a basque substrate and a semitic superstrate in germanic  however  his speculations  too  are generally rejected by specialists in the relevant in germanic etymology continues  and many germanic words whose origins were previously unclear or controversial now have plausible explanations in terms of reconstructed indo-european  words and morphology  thus  the proportion of germanic words without any plausible etymological explanation has decreased over time  estimates of that proportion are typically outdated or inflated  as many of these proposals were unknown when scholars were compiling lists of unexplained germanic needed the following conventions are used in this article for transcribing proto-germanic  reconstructed forms the table lists the consonantal phonemes of proto-germanic

as applied to pre-proto-germanic  is a chain shift of the original indo-european  plosives  verner s law explains a category of exceptions to grimm s law  where a voiced fricative appears where grimm s law predicts a voiceless fricative  the discrepancy is conditioned by the placement of the original indo-european  word accent p  t  and k did not undergo grimm s law after a fricative  such as s  or after other plosives  which were shifted to fricatives by the germanic spirant law   for example  where latin  with the original t  has stella  star  and octō  eight   middle dutch has ster and acht  with unshifted this original t merged with the shifted t from the voiced consonant  that is  most of the instances of  t  came from either the original  t  or the shifted  t   a similar shift on the consonant inventory of proto-germanic  later generated high german  mcmahon and verner s laws     together form the first germanic consonant shift  a second  and chronologically later second germanic consonant shift     affected only proto-germanic  voiceless stops     and split germanic into two sets of dialects  low german in the north     and high german further south      verner s law is usually reconstructed as following grimm s law in time  and states that unvoiced fricatives   s    ɸ    θ    x  are voiced when preceded by an unaccented syllable  the accent at the time of the change was the one inherited from proto-indo-european,  which was free and could occur on any syllable  for example  pie  bʰréh₂tēr   pgmc   brōþēr  brother  but pie  meh₂tḗr   pgmc   mōdēr  mother   the voicing of some  s  according to verner s law produced  z   a new sometime after grimm s and verner s law  proto-germanic  lost its inherited contrastive accent  and all words became stressed on their root syllable  this was generally the first syllable unless a prefix was attached the loss of the proto-indo-european  contrastive accent got rid of the conditioning environment for the consonant alternations created by verner s law  without this conditioning environment  the cause of the alternation was no longer obvious to native speakers  the alternations that had started as mere phonetic variants of sounds became increasingly grammatical in nature  leading to the grammatical alternations of sounds known as grammatischer wechsel  for a single word  the grammatical stem could display different consonants depending on its grammatical case or its tense  as a result of the complexity of this system  significant levelling of these sounds occurred throughout the germanic period as well as in the later daughter languages  already in proto-germanic,  most alternations in nouns were leveled to have only one sound or the other consistently throughout all forms of a word  although some alternations were preserved  only to be levelled later in the daughters  but differently in each one   alternations in noun and verb endings were also levelled  usually in favour of the voiced alternants in nouns  but a split remained in verbs where unsuffixed  strong  verbs received the voiced alternants while suffixed  weak  verbs had the voiceless alternants  alternation between the present and past of strong verbs remained common and was not levelled in proto-germanic,  and survives up to the present day in some germanic languages some of the consonants that developed from the sound shifts are thought to have been pronounced in different ways  allophones  depending on the sounds around them  with regard to original  k  or  kʷ  trask resulting  x  or  xʷ  were reduced to  h  and  hʷ  in word-initial  position  many of the consonants listed in the table could appear lengthened or prolonged under some circumstances  which is inferred from their appearing in some daughter languages as doubled letters  this phenomenon is termed gemination  kraehenmann proto-germanic  already had long consonants … but they contrasted with short ones only word-medially.  moreover  they were not very frequent and occurred only intervocally almost exclusively after short vowels  the voiced phonemes  b    d    ɡ  and  ɡʷ  are reconstructed with the pronunciation of stops in some environments and fricatives in others  the pattern of allophony is not completely clear  but generally is similar to the patterns of voiced obstruent allophones in languages such as the voiced fricatives of verner s law  see above   which only occurred in non-word-initial  positions  merged with the fricative allophones of  b    d    ɡ  and  ɡʷ   older accounts tended to suggest that the sounds were originally fricatives and later  hardened  into stops in some circumstances  however  ringe notes that this belief was largely due to theory-internal  considerations of older phonological theories  and in modern theories it is equally possible that the allophony was present from the of the three voiced phonemes  b    d   and  ɡ  had a slightly different pattern of allophony from the others  but in general stops occurred in  strong  positions (word-initial  and in clusters  while fricatives occurred in  weak  positions (post-vocalic).  more specifically numerous additional changes affected the labiovelar consonants kroonen (2011)  posits a process of consonant mutation for proto-germanic,  under the name consonant  this is distinct from the consonant mutation processes occurring in the neighboring samic and finnic languages  also known as consonant gradation since the 19th  century   the proto-germanic  consonant gradation is not directly attested in any of the germanic dialects  but may nevertheless be reconstructed on the basis of certain dialectal discrepancies in root of the n-stems  and the ōn-verbs.diachronically,  the rise of consonant gradation in germanic can be explained by kluge s law  by which geminates arose from stops followed by a nasal in a stressed syllable  since this sound law only operated in part of the paradigms of the n-stems  and ōn-verbs,  it gave rise to an alternation of geminated and non-geminated  consonants  however  there has been controversy about the validity of this law  with some linguists preferring to explain the development of geminate consonants with the idea of  expressive gemination   the origin of the germanic geminate consonants is currently a disputed part of historical linguistics with no clear consensus at present the reconstruction of grading paradigms in proto-germanic  explains root alternations such as old english steorra  star    *sterran-  vs  old frisian stera  id     *steran-  and norwegian  dial   guva  to swing    *gubōn-  vs  middle high german gupfen  id     *guppōn-  as generalizations of the original allomorphy  in the cases concerned  this would imply reconstructing an n-stem  nom   sterō  gen   sterraz   pie *h2stér-ōn,  *h2ster-n-ós  and an ōn-verb  3sg.   guppōþi  3pl.   gubunanþi   *ghubh-néh2-ti,  *ghubh-nh2-énti.proto-germanic  had four short five or six long vowels  and at least one  overlong  or  trimoric  vowel  the exact phonetic quality of the vowels is uncertain notes pie ə a o merged into pgmc a  pie ā ō merged into pgmc ō  at the time of the merger  the vowels probably were and or perhaps and their timbres then differentiated by raising  and perhaps rounding  the long vowel to needed   it is known that the raising of ā to ō can not have occurred earlier than the earliest contact between proto-germanic  speakers and the romans  this can be verified by the fact that latin rōmānī later emerges in gothic as rumoneis  that is  rūmōnīs   it is explained by ringe that at the time of borrowing  the vowel matching closest in sound to latin ā was a proto-germanic  ā-like  vowel  which later became ō   and since proto-germanic  therefore lacked a mid(-high)  back vowel  the closest equivalent of latin ō was proto-germanic  ū  rōmānī    rūmānīz    rūmōnīz   gothic rumoneis a new ā was formed following the shift from ā to ō when intervocalic  j  was lost in -aja-  sequences  it was a rare phoneme  and occurred only in a handful of words  the most notable being the verbs of the third weak class  the agent noun suffix *-ārijaz   modern english -er)  was likely borrowed from latin around or shortly after this time the following diphthongs are known to have existed in proto-germanic:note  the change  e     i  before  i  or  j  in the same or following syllable  this removed  ei   which became  iː   but created  iu  from earlier  eu  diphthongs in proto-germanic  can also be analysed as sequences of a vowel plus an approximant  as was the case in proto-indo-european.  this explains why  j  was not lost in  niwjaz   new    the second element of the diphthong iu was still underlyingly a consonant and therefore the conditioning environment for the loss was not met  this is also confirmed by the fact that later in the west germanic gemination  -wj-  is geminated to -wwj-  in parallel with the other consonants  except /r/).proto-germanic  had two overlong or trimoraic long vowels ô and ê the latter mainly in adverbs  cf   hwadrê  whereto  none of the documented languages still include such vowels  their reconstruction is due to the comparative method  particularly as a way of explaining an otherwise unpredictable two-way  split of reconstructed long ō in final syllables  which unexpectedly remained long in some morphemes but shows normal shortening in others trimoraic vowels generally occurred at morpheme boundaries where a bimoraic long vowel and a short vowel in hiatus contracted  especially after the loss of an intervening laryngeal one example  without a laryngeal  includes the class ii weak verbs (ō-stems)  where a -j-  was lost between vowels  so that -ōja  → ōa → ô  cf   salbōjaną →  salbôną → gothic salbōn  to anoint    however  the majority occurred in word-final  syllables  inflectional endings  probably because in this position the vowel could not be additionally  germanic  like balto-slavic,  lengthened bimoraic long vowels in absolute final position  perhaps to better conform to a word s prosodic template  e g   pgmc  arô  eagle  ← pie  h₃érō just as lith akmuõ  stone   osl kamy ←  aḱmō̃ ← pie  h₂éḱmō  contrast but vowels that were lengthened by laryngeals did not become overlong  compare trimoraic vowels are distinguished from bimoraic vowels by their outcomes in attested germanic languages  word-final  trimoraic vowels remained long vowels while bimoraic vowels developed into short vowels  older theories about the phenomenon claimed that long and overlong vowels were both long but differed in tone  i e   ô and ê had a  circumflex  (rise-fall-rise)  tone while ō and ē had an  acute   rising  tone  much like the tones of modern scandinavian baltic  and ancient greek  and asserted that this distinction was inherited from pie  however  this view was abandoned since languages do not combine distinctive intonations on unstressed syllables with contrastive stress and vowel modern theories have reinterpreted overlong vowels as having superheavy syllable weight  three moras  and therefore greater length than ordinary long vowels by the end of the proto-germanic  period  word-final  long vowels were shortened to short vowels  following that  overlong vowels were shortened to regular long vowels in all positions  merging with originally long vowels except word-finally   because of the earlier shortening   so that they remained distinct in that position  this was a late dialectal development  because the end result was not the same in all germanic languages  word-final  ē shortened to a in east and west germanic but to i in old norse  and word-final  ō shortened to a in gothic but to o  probably in early north and west germanic  with a later raising to u  the 6th  century salic law still has maltho in late frankish  the shortened overlong vowels in final position developed as regular long vowels from that point on  including the lowering of ē to ā in north and west germanic  the monophthongization of unstressed au in northwest germanic produced a phoneme which merged with this new word-final  long ō  while the monophthongization of unstressed ai produced a new ē which did not merge with original ē  but rather with ē₂  as it was not lowered to ā  this split  combined with the asymmetric development in west germanic  with ē lowering but ō raising  points to an early difference in the articulation height of the two vowels that was not present in north germanic  it could be seen as evidence that the lowering of ē to ā began in west germanic at a time when final vowels were still long  and spread to north germanic through the late germanic dialect continuum  but only reaching the latter after the vowels had already been shortened ē₂ is uncertain as a phoneme and only reconstructed from a small number of words  it is posited by the comparative method because whereas all provable instances of inherited  pie   ē  pgmc   ē₁  are distributed in gothic as ē and the other germanic languages as all the germanic languages agree on some occasions of ē  e g   goth oe on hēr ‘here‘ ← late pgmc   hē₂r   gothic makes no orthographic and therefore presumably no phonetic distinction between ē₁ and ē₂  but the existence of two proto-germanic  long e-like  phonemes is supported by the existence of two e-like  elder futhark runes  ehwaz and eihwaz krahe treats ē₂  secondary ē  as identical with ī  it probably continues pie ēi  and it may have been in the process of transition from a diphthong to a long simple vowel in the proto-germanic  period  lehmann lists the following origins for developed nasal vowels from two sources  the earlier and much more frequent source was word-final  -n   from pie -n  or -m)  in unstressed syllables  which at first gave rise to short -ą,  -į,  -ų,  long -į̄,  -ę̄,  -ą̄,  and overlong -ę̂,  -ą̂.  -ę̄  and -ę̂  then merged into -ą̄  and -ą̂,  which later developed into -ǭ  and -ǫ̂.  another source  developing only in late proto-germanic  times  was in the sequences -inh-,  -anh-,  -unh-,  in which the nasal consonant lost its occlusion and was converted into lengthening and nasalisation of the preceding vowel  becoming -ą̄h-,  -į̄h-,  -ų̄h-   still written as -anh-,  -inh-,  -unh-  in this article  in many cases  the nasality was not contrastive and was merely present as an additional surface articulation  no germanic language that preserves the word-final  vowels has their nasality preserved  word-final  short nasal vowels do not show different reflexes compared to non-nasal  vowels  however  the comparative method does require a three-way  phonemic distinction between word-final  *-ō,  *-ǭ  and *-ōn,  which each has a distinct pattern of reflexes in the later germanic languages the distinct reflexes of nasal -ǭ  versus non-nasal  -ō  are caused by the northwest germanic raising of final -ō   ɔː  to  oː   which did not affect -ǭ.  when the vowels were shortened and denasalised  these two vowels no longer had the same place of articulation  and did not merge  -ō  became  o   later  u   while -ǭ  became  ɔ   later  ɑ    this allowed their reflexes to stay distinct the nasality of word-internal  vowels  from -nh-)  was more stable  and survived into the early dialects intact phonemic nasal vowels definitely occurred in proto-norse  and old norse  they were preserved in old icelandic down to at least a d  1125,  the earliest possible time for the creation of the first grammatical treatise  which documents nasal vowels  the pg nasal vowels from -nh-  sequences were preserved in old icelandic as shown by examples given in the first grammatical treatise  for example the phonemicity is evident from minimal pairs like ǿ̇ra  younger  vs  ǿra  vex    *wor-,  cognate with english the inherited proto-germanic  nasal vowels were joined in old norse by nasal vowels from other sources  e g  loss of  n before s  modern elfdalian still includes nasal vowels that directly derive from old norse  e g  gą̊s  goose    old norse gás  presumably nasalized  although not so written   cf  german gans  showing the original consonant similar surface  possibly phonemic  nasal/non-nasal  contrasts occurred in the west germanic languages down through proto-anglo-frisian  of a d  400  or so  proto-germanic  medial nasal vowels were inherited  but were joined by new nasal vowels resulting from the ingvaeonic nasal spirant law  which extended the loss of nasal consonants  only before -h-  in proto-germanic)  to all environments before a fricative  thus including -mf-,  -nþ-  and -ns-  as well   the contrast between nasal and non-nasal  long vowels is reflected in the differing output of nasalized long  ą̄  which was raised to ō in old english and old frisian whereas non-nasal   ā appeared as fronted ǣ  hence:proto-germanic  allowed the following clusters in initial and medial position it allowed the following clusters in medial position only it allowed the following clusters in medial and final position only the s   voiceless plosive clusters  sp  st  sk  could appear in any position in a word due to the emergence of a word-initial  stress accent  vowels in unstressed syllables were gradually reduced over time  beginning at the very end of the proto-germanic  period and continuing into the history of the various dialects  already in proto-germanic,  word-final   e  and  ɑ  had been lost  and  e  had merged with  i  in unstressed syllables  vowels in third syllables were also generally lost before dialect diversification began  such as final -i  of some present tense verb endings  and in -maz  and -miz  of the dative plural ending and 1st  person plural present of verbs.word-final  short nasal vowels were however preserved longer  as is reflected proto-norse  which still preserved word-final  -ą   horna on the gallehus horns   while the dative plural appears as -mz   gestumz on the stentoften runestone   somewhat greater reduction is found in gothic  which lost all final-syllable  short vowels except u  old high german and old english initially preserved unstressed i and u  but later lost them in long-stemmed  words and then old high german lost them in many short-stemmed  ones as well  by analogy old english shows indirect evidence that word-final  -ą  was preserved into the separate history of the language  this can be seen in the infinitive ending -an      aną  and the strong past participle ending -en     *-anaz).  since the early old english fronting of  ɑ  to  æ  did not occur in nasalized vowels or before back vowels  this created a vowel alternation because the nasality of the back vowel ą in the infinitive ending prevented the fronting of the preceding vowel  *-aną    *-an,  but *-anaz    *-ænæ    *-en.  therefore  the anglo-frisian  brightening must necessarily have occurred very early in the history of the anglo-frisian  languages  before the loss of final -ą.the  outcome of final vowels and combinations in the various daughters is shown in the table below note that some proto-germanic  endings have merged in all of the literary languages but are still distinct in runic proto-norse,  e g  *-īz  vs  *-ijaz   þrijōz dohtrīz  three daughters  in the tune stone vs  the name holtijaz in the gallehus horns  reconstructions are tentative and multiple versions with varying degrees of difference exist  all reconstructed forms are marked with an asterisk     it is often asserted that the germanic languages have a highly reduced system of inflections as compared with greek  latin  or sanskrit  although this is true to some extent  it is probably due more to the late time of attestation of germanic than to any inherent  simplicity  of the germanic languages  as an example  there are less than 500  years between the gothic gospels of 360  and the old high germanic tatian of 830,  yet old high germanic  despite being the most archaic of the west germanic languages  is missing a large number of archaic features present in gothic  including dual and passive markings on verbs  reduplication in class vii strong verb past tenses  the vocative case  and second-position   wackernagel s law  clitics  many more archaic features may have been lost between the proto-germanic  of 200  bc or so and the attested gothic language  furthermore  proto-romance  and middle indic of the fourth century ad—contemporaneous with gothic—were significantly simpler than latin and sanskrit  respectively  and overall probably no more archaic than gothic  in addition  some parts of the inflectional systems of greek  latin  and sanskrit were innovations that were not present in proto-indo-european.proto-germanic  had six cases  three genders  three numbers  three moods  indicative  subjunctive  pie optative   imperative   and two voices  active and passive  pie middle    this is quite similar to the state of latin  greek  and middle indic of c  ad 200.nouns  and adjectives were declined in  at least  six cases  vocative  nominative  accusative  dative  instrumental  genitive  the locative case had merged into the dative case  and the ablative may have merged with either the genitive  dative or instrumental cases  however  sparse remnants of the earlier locative and ablative cases are visible in a few pronominal and adverbial forms  pronouns were declined similarly  although without a separate vocative form  the instrumental and vocative can be reconstructed only in the singular  the instrumental survives only in the west germanic languages  and the vocative only in gothic verbs and pronouns had three numbers  singular  dual  and plural  although the pronominal dual survived into all the oldest languages  the verbal dual survived only into gothic  and the  presumed  nominal and adjectival dual forms were lost before the oldest records  as in the italic languages  it may have been lost before proto-germanic  became a different branch at all several sound changes occurred in the history of proto-germanic  that were triggered only in some environments but not in others  some of these were grammaticalised while others were still triggered by phonetic rules and were partially allophonic or surface filters probably the most far-reaching  alternation was between  þ   s   h   hw  and  d   z   g   gw   the voiceless and voiced fricatives  known as grammatischer wechsel and triggered by the earlier operation of verner s law  it was found in various environments another form of alternation was triggered by the germanic spirant law  which continued to operate into the separate history of the individual daughter languages  it is found in environments with suffixal -t,  including an alternation not triggered by sound change was sievers  law  which caused alternation of suffixal -j-  and -ij-  depending on the length of the preceding part of the morpheme  if preceded within the same morpheme by only short vowel followed by a single consonant  -j-  appeared  in all other cases  such as when preceded by a long vowel or diphthong  by two or more consonants  or by more than one syllable  -ij-  appeared  the distinction between morphemes and words is important here  as the alternant -j-  appeared also in words that contained a distinct suffix that in turn contained -j-  in its second syllable  a notable example was the verb suffix *-atjaną,  which retained -j-  despite being preceded by two syllables in a fully formed word related to the above was the alternation between -j-  and -i-,  and likewise between -ij-  and -ī-.  this was caused by the earlier loss of -j-  before -i-,  and appeared whenever an ending was attached to a verb or noun with an -(i)j-  suffix  which were numerous   similar  but much more rare  was an alternation between -av-  and -aic-  from the loss of -j-  between two vowels  which appeared in the present subjunctive of verbs  *-aų    *-ajų  in the first person  *-ai-  in the others  a combination of these two effects created an alternation between -ā-  and -ai-  found in class 3  weak verbs  with -ā-    -aja-    -əja-  and -ai-    -əi-    -əji-.i-mutation  was the most important source of vowel alternation  and continued well into the history of the individual daughter languages  although it was either absent or not apparent in gothic   in proto-germanic,  only -e-  was affected  which was raised by -i-  or -j-  in the following syllable  examples are numerous the system of nominal declensions was largely inherited from pie  primary nominal declensions were the stems in  a    ō    n    i   and  u   the first three were particularly important and served as the basis of adjectival declension  there was a tendency for nouns of all other classes to be drawn into them  the first two had variants in  ja  and  wa   and  jō  and  wō   respectively  originally  these were declined exactly like other nouns of the respective class  but later sound changes tended to distinguish these variants as their own subclasses  the  n  nouns had various subclasses  including  ōn   masculine and feminine    an   neuter   and  īn   feminine  mostly abstract nouns   there was also a smaller class of root nouns  ending in various consonants   nouns of relationship  ending in  er    and neuter nouns in  z   this class was greatly expanded in german   present participles  and a few nouns  ended in  nd   the neuter nouns of all classes differed from the masculines and feminines in their nominative and accusative endings  which were alike adjectives agree with the noun they qualify in case  number  and gender  adjectives evolved into strong and weak declensions  originally with indefinite and definite meaning  respectively  as a result of its definite meaning  the weak form came to be used in the daughter languages in conjunction with demonstratives and definite articles  the terms  strong  and  weak  are based on the later development of these declensions in languages such as german and old english  where the strong declensions have more distinct endings  in the proto-language,  as in gothic  such terms have no relevance  the strong declension was based on a combination of the nominal  a  and  ō  stems with the pie pronominal endings  the weak declension was based on the nominal  n  declension.proto-germanic  originally had two demonstratives  proximal *hi-  ‘this’  distal  sa sō þat ‘that’  which could serve as both adjectives and pronouns  although the proximal was obsolescent in gothic  e g  goth acc  hina  dat  himma  neut  hita  and obsolete everywhere else  ultimately  only the distal survived  evolved into the definite article  and underlies the english determiners the and that  in the north-west  germanic languages  but not in gothic   a new proximal demonstrative   this  as opposed to  that   evolved by appending -si  to the distal demonstrative  e g  runic norse nom sg  sa-si,  gen  þes-si,  dat  þeim-si),  with complex subsequent developments in the various daughter languages  the new demonstrative underlies the english determiners this  these and those   originally  these  those were dialectal variants of the masculine plural of this.)proto-germanic  had only two tenses  past and present   compared to 5-7  in greek  latin  proto-slavic  and sanskrit  some of this difference is due to deflexion  featured by a loss of tenses present in proto-indo-european.  for example  donald ringe assumes for proto-germanic  an early loss of the pie imperfect aspect  something that also occurred in most other branches   followed by merging of the aspectual categories present-aorist  and the mood categories indicative-subjunctive.   this assumption allows him to account for cases where proto-germanic  has present indicative verb forms that look like pie aorist subjunctives  however  many of the tenses of the other languages  e g  future  future perfect  pluperfect  latin imperfect  are not cognate with each other and represent separate innovations in each language  for example  the greek future uses a -s-  ending  apparently derived from a desiderative construction that in pie was part of the system of derivational morphology  not the inflectional system   the sanskrit future uses a -sy-  ending  from a different desiderative verb construction and often with a different ablaut grade from greek  while the latin future uses endings derived either from the pie subjunctive or from the pie verb   bʱuː   to be   similarly  the latin imperfect and pluperfect stem from italic innovations and are not cognate with the corresponding greek or sanskrit forms  and while the greek and sanskrit pluperfect tenses appear cognate  there are no parallels in any other indo-european  languages  leading to the conclusion that this tense is either a shared greek-sanskrit  innovation or separate  coincidental developments in the two languages  in this respect  proto-germanic  can be said to be characterized by the failure to innovate new synthetic tenses as much as the loss of existing tenses  later germanic languages did innovate new tenses  derived through periphrastic constructions  with modern english likely possessing the most elaborated tense system   yes  the house will still be being built a month from now    on the other hand  even the past tense was later lost  or widely lost  in most high german dialects as well as in afrikaans verbs in proto-germanic  were divided into two main groups  called  strong  and  weak   according to the way the past tense is formed  strong verbs use ablaut  i e  a different vowel in the stem  and or reduplication  derived primarily from the proto-indo-european  perfect   while weak verbs use a dental suffix  now generally held to be a reflex of the reduplicated imperfect of pie *dheh1-  originally  put   in germanic  do    strong verbs were divided into seven main classes while weak verbs were divided into five main classes  although no attested language has more than four classes of weak verbs   strong verbs generally have no suffix in the present tense  although some have a -j-  suffix that is a direct continuation of the pie -y-  suffix  and a few have an -n-  suffix or infix that continues the -n-  infix of pie  almost all weak verbs have a present-tense  suffix  which varies from class to class  an additional small  but very important  group of verbs formed their present tense from the pie perfect  and their past tense like weak verbs   for this reason  they are known as preterite-present  verbs  all three of the previously mentioned groups of verbs—strong  weak and preterite-present—are  derived from pie thematic verbs  an additional very small group derives from pie athematic verbs  and one verb  wiljaną  to want  forms its present indicative from the pie optative mood.proto-germanic  verbs have three moods  indicative  subjunctive and imperative  the subjunctive mood derives from the pie optative mood  indicative and subjunctive moods are fully conjugated throughout the present and past  while the imperative mood existed only in the present tense and lacked first-person  forms  proto-germanic  verbs have two voices  active and passive  the latter deriving from the pie mediopassive voice  the proto-germanic  passive existed only in the present tense  an inherited feature  as the pie perfect had no mediopassive   on the evidence of gothic—the only germanic language with a reflex of the proto-germanic  passive—the passive voice had a significantly reduced inflectional system  with a single form used for all persons of the dual and plural  note that  although old norse has an inflected mediopassive  it is not inherited from proto-germanic,  but is an innovation formed by attaching the reflexive pronoun to the active voice although most proto-germanic  strong verbs are formed directly from a verbal root  weak verbs are generally derived from an existing noun  verb or adjective (so-called  denominal  deverbal and deadjectival verbs   for example  a significant subclass of class i weak verbs are  deverbal  causative verbs  these are formed in a way that reflects a direct inheritance from the pie causative class of verbs  pie causatives were formed by adding an accented suffix -éi̯e/éi̯o  to the o-grade  of a non-derived  verb  in proto-germanic,  causatives are formed by adding a suffix -j/ij-   the reflex of pie -éi̯e/éi̯o)  to the past-tense  ablaut  mostly with the reflex of pie o-grade)  of a strong verb  the reflex of pie non-derived  verbs   with verner s law voicing applied  the reflex of the pie accent on the -éi̯e/éi̯o  suffix   examples as in other indo-european  languages  a verb in proto-germanic  could have a preverb attached to it  modifying its meaning  cf  e g  *fra-werþaną   to perish   derived from  werþaną  to become    in proto-germanic,  the preverb was still a clitic that could be separated from the verb  as also in gothic  as shown by the behavior of second-position  clitics  e g  diz-uh-þan-sat   and then he seized   with clitics uh  and  and þan  then  interpolated into dis-sat   he seized   rather than a bound morpheme that is permanently attached to the verb  at least in gothic  preverbs could also be stacked one on top of the other  similar to sanskrit  different from latin   e g  ga-ga-waírþjan   to reconcile  an example verb   nemaną  to take   class 4  strong verb).1  – unstressed variantaugust schleicher wrote a fable in the pie

of the pie text  it does not take into account various idiomatic and grammatical shifts that occurred over the period  for example  the original text uses the imperfect tense  which disappeared in proto-germanic.  the second version takes these differences into account  and is therefore closer to the language the germanic people would have actually spoken.proto-germanic,  phonetic evolution
