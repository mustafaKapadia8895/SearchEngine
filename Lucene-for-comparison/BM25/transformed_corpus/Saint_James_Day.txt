the north foreland and the battle of orfordness  took place on 25  july 1666  — st james  day in the julian calendar then in use in england (4  august 1666  in the gregorian calendar   during the second anglo-dutch  war and was fought between fleets of england  commanded jointly by prince rupert of the rhine and george monck  1st  duke of albemarle  and the united provinces commanded by lieutenant-admiral  michiel de ruyter  in the netherlands  the battle is known as the two days  battle after the dutch had inflicted considerable damage on the english fleet in the four days battle  the leading dutch politician  grand pensionary johan de witt  ordered lieutenant-admiral  michiel de ruyter to carry out a plan that had been prepared for over a year  to land in the medway to destroy the english fleet while it was being repaired in the chatham dockyards  for this purpose  ten fluyt ships carried 2,700  marines of the newly created dutch marine corps  one of the first in history to be specialised in amphibious landings  also  de ruyter was to combine his fleet with the french one the french  however  failed to show up and bad weather prevented the landing  de ruyter had to limit his actions to a blockade of the thames  on 1  august  he observed that the english fleet was leaving port  earlier than expected  then  a storm drove the dutch fleet back to the flemish coast  on 3  august  de ruyter again crossed the north sea  leaving behind the troop ships in the early morning of 25  july  the dutch fleet of 88  ships discovered the english fleet of 89  ships near north foreland  sailing to the north  and pursued it from the southeast in a leeward position  as the wind blew from the northwest  suddenly  the wind turned to the northeast  the commander of the english fleet  prince rupert of the rhine  then turned sharply east to regain the weather gauge and de ruyter followed to keep it  this proved to be a fatal manoeuvre for the dutch  they now sailed right into the core of a high-pressure  area  the dutch van  commanded by lieutenant-admiral  johan evertsen  lost all speed and couldn t maintain a line of battle  this awkward situation lasted for hours  then  again  a soft breeze began to blow from the northeast  immediately  the english van  commanded by thomas allin  and part of the centre formed a line of battle and sailed right to the dutch van  still in disarray and basically defenceless  ship after ship of the frisian fleet was mauled by the combined firepower of the english line  vice-admiral  rudolf coenders was killed  lieutenant-admiral  tjerk hiddes de vries had an arm and a leg shot off  yet still tried to bring cohesion to his forces  but to no avail  unable to reach them with his centre  the horrified de ruyter saw the frisian ships drifting to the south  now no more than floating wrecks full of dead  the moans of the dying clearly audible above the other sounds of battle now rupert combined his full van and centre to deliver the coup-de-grâce  to the dutch centre  george monck  accompanying rupert  predicted that de ruyter would give two broadsides and run  but the latter put up a furious fight on the dutch flagship de zeven provinciën  he withstood a combined attack by sovereign of the seas and royal charles and forced rupert to leave the damaged royal charles for royal james  this way  de ruyter managed to cover the retreat of the dutch van meanwhile  lieutenant-admiral  cornelis tromp  commanding the dutch rear  had seen the sad events evolve from a great distance  annoyed by the lack of competence shown  he decided to give the correct example  he turned sharply to the west  crossed the line of the english rear  commanded by jeremiah smith  separating it from the rest of the english fleet and then  having the weather gauge  kept attacking it doggedly until at last the english were routed and fled to the west  he pursued well into the night  destroying resolution with a fireship  after tromp thrice shot the entire crew from its rigging  smith s flagship loyal london had to be towed home  the vice commander of the english rear was edward spragge  who felt so humiliated by the course of events that he became a personal enemy of tromp  dying himself while trying to kill his foe in the battle of texel on the morning of 26  july  tromp broke off pursuit  well-pleased  with his first real victory as a squadron commander  during the night  a ship had brought him the message that de ruyter had likewise been victorious  so tromp was in a euphoric mood  that abruptly changed upon the discovery of the drifting flagship of the dying tjerk hiddes de vries  suddenly he feared that his ship was now the only remnant of the dutch fleet and that he was in mortal peril  behind him  those ships of the english rear still operational had again turned to the east  in front  the other enemy squadrons surely awaited him  on the horizon  only english flags were to be seen  manoeuvring wildly  tromp  drinking a lot of gin to restore his nerve  dodged any attempt to trap him and brought his squadron safely home in the port of flushing on the morning of 26  july  there  to great mutual relief  he discovered the rest of the dutch fleet it took tromp six hours to gather enough courage to face de ruyter  it was obvious to him that he should never have allowed himself to get completely separated from the main force  indeed de ruyter  not being his usual charitable self  immediately blamed him for the defeat and ordered tromp and his subcommanders isaac sweers and willem van der zaan from his sight  and told them to never again set foot on de zeven provinciën  the commander of the dutch fleet still hadn t mentally recovered from the events of the previous day on the morning of 5  august  after a short summer s night  de ruyter discovered that his position had become hopeless  lieutenant-admiral  johan evertsen had died after losing a leg  de ruyter s force was now reduced to about forty ships  crowding together and most of these were inoperational  being survivors of the van  some fifteen good ships had apparently deserted during the night  a strong gale from the east prevented an easy retreat to the continental coast  and to the west the british van and centre  about fifty ships  surrounded him in a half-circle,  safely bombarding him from a leeward position de ruyter was desperate  when his second-in-command  of the centre  lieutenant-admiral  aert jansse van nes visited him for a council of war  he exclaimed   with seven or eight against the mass   he then sagged  mumbling   what s wrong with us  i wish i were dead   his close personal friend van nes tried to cheer him up  joking   me too  but you never die when you want to   no sooner had both men left the cabin than the table they had been sitting at was smashed by a cannonball the english  however  had their own problems  the strong gale prevented them from closing with the dutch  they tried to use fire ships  but these  too  had trouble reaching the enemy  only the sloop fan-fan,  rupert s personal pleasure yacht  rowed to the dutch flagship de zeven provinciën to harass it with its two little guns  much to the hilarious laughter of the english crews when his ship had again warded off an attack by a fire ship  the land of promise  and tromp still didn t show up  for de ruyter tension became unbearable  he sought death  exposing himself deliberately on the deck  when he failed to be hit  he exclaimed   oh  god  how unfortunate i am  amongst so many thousands of cannonballs  is there not one that would take me   his son-in-law,  captain of the marines johann de witte  heard him and said   father  what desperate words  if you merely want to die  let us then turn  sail in the midst of our enemies and fight ourselves to death    this brave but foolish proposal brought the admiral back to his senses  for he discovered that he wasn t so desperate and answered   you don t know what you are talking about  if i did that  all would be lost  but if i can bring myself and these ships safely home  we ll finish the job later  then the wind  that had brought so much misfortune to the dutch  saved them by turning to the west  they formed a line of battle and brought their fleet to safety through the flemish shoals  vice-admiral  adriaen banckert of the zealandic fleet covering the retreat of all damaged ships with the operational vessels  the number of the latter slowly growing as it turned out that only very few ships had actually deserted in the night  most had merely drifted away  and now  one after the other  they rejoined the battle the battle was a clear english victory  but the separate clash of the two years was a victory for tromp  dutch casualties were enormous  estimated immediately after the battle of about 5,000  men  compared with 300  english killed  later  more precise information showed that only about 1,200  of them had been killed or seriously wounded  however  the dutch lost only two ships  de ruyter had been successful at saving almost the complete van  only sneek and tholen struck their flag  and they could quickly repair the damage  the twin disasters of the great plague of london and the great fire of london  however  combined with his financial mismanagement  left charles ii without the funds to continue the war  in fact  he had had only enough reserves for this one last battle  the dutch soon recovered  within a month  they again took sea  but only a minor skirmish resulted  during this later fight  de ruyter inhaled a burning fuse filament that burnt a fistula in his throat  he would recover just in time to inflict a severe blow on the english navy in the raid on the medway in 1667,  when  at last  he could carry out the plan he was prevented from executing in 1666.during  the weeks that the dutch fleet was in repair  admiral robert holmes  aided by the dutch traitor laurens van heemskerck  penetrated the vlie estuary  burnt a fleet of 150  merchants  holmes s bonfire  and sacked the town of ter schelling  the present west-terschelling)  on the frisian island of terschelling  fan-fan  was again present in the republic  the defeat also had a far-reaching  political effect  tromp was the champion of the orangist party  now that he was accused of severe negligence  the country split over this issue  to defend himself  tromp let his brother-in-law,  johan kievit  publish an account of his conduct  shortly afterward  kievit was discovered to have planned a coup  secretly negotiating a peace treaty with the english king  he fled to england and was condemned to death in absentia  tromp s family was fined and he himself forbidden to serve in the fleet  in november 1669,  a supporter of tromp tried to stab de ruyter in the entrance hall of his house  only in 1672  would tromp have his revenge  when johan de witt was murdered  some claim tromp has had a hand  the new ruler  william iii of orange  succeeded  with great difficulty  in reconciling de ruyter with tromp in 1673.brandt,  gerard (1687),  het leven en bedryf van den heere michiel de ruiter
