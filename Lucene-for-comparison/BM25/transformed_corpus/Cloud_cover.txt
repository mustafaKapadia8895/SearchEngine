 cloud cover -  wikipediacloud cover  also known as cloudiness  cloudage  or cloud amount  refers to the fraction of the sky obscured by clouds when observed from a particular okta is the usual unit of measurement of the cloud cover  the cloud cover is correlated to the sunshine duration as the least cloudy locales are the sunniest ones while the cloudiest areas are the least sunny places the global cloud cover averages around 0.68  when analyzing clouds with optical depth larger than 0.1.  this value is lower (0.56)  when considering clouds with an optical depth larger than 2,  and higher when counting subvisible cirrus play multiple critical roles in the climate system  in particular  being bright objects in the visible part of the solar spectrum  they efficiently reflect light to space and thus contribute to the cooling of the planet  cloud cover thus plays an important role in the energetic balance of the atmosphere and a variation of it is a consequence of and to the climate change expected by recent cover values only vary by 0.03  from year to year  whereas the local  day to day variability in cloud amount typically rises to 0.3  over the globe  most data sets agree on the fact that the land is covered by 0.10-0.15  less cloud than the there is a latitudinal variation in the cloud cover  such that around 20°n  there are regions with 0.10  less cloudiness than the global mean  almost the same variation (0.15  instead of 0.10)  is found 20°s.  on the other hand  in the storm regions of the southern hemisphere midlatitudes were found to have with 0.15-0.25  more cloudiness than the global mean at on average  about 52%  of earth is cloud-covered  at any some regions are almost always cloudy such as the amazon rainforest and some others are almost always clear such as the sahara desert
