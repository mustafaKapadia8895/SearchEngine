heavy black cloud suspended to the their investigation revealed it to be the larger island they called first portuguese settlers began colonizing the islands around 1420  or production began to fall and the ensuing crisis forced henry the navigator to order other commercial crops to be planted so that the islands could be needed  these specialised plants  and their associated industrial technology  created one of the major revolutions on the islands and fuelled portuguese industry  following the introduction of the first water-driven  sugar mill on madeira  sugar production increased to over 6,000  arrobas  an arroba was equal to 11  to 12  kilograms  by using advisers from sicily and financed by genoese capital   genoa acted as an integral part of the island economy until the

700,000  years this was followed by extensive erosion  producing two large amphitheatres open to south in the central part of the island  volcanic activity later resumed  producing scoria cones and lava flows atop the older eroded shield  the most recent volcanic eruptions were on the west-central  part of the island only 6,500  years ago  creating more cinder cones and lava is the largest

aqueducts to carry water to the agricultural regions in the south  madeira is very mountainous  and building the levadas was difficult and often sentenced criminals or slaves were needed  many are cut into the sides of mountains  and it was also necessary to dig 25  miles (40  km  of tunnels  some of which are still accessible today the levadas not only supply water to the southern parts of the island but provide hydro-electric  there are over 1,350  miles (2,170  km  of levadas and they provide a network of walking paths  some provide easy and relaxing walks through the countryside  but others are narrow  crumbling ledges where a slip could result in serious injury or death two of the most popular levadas to hike are the levada do caldeirão verde and the levada do caldeirão do
