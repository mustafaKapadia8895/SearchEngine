 galileo galilei -  wikipediagalileo galilei  italian  ɡaliˈlɛi   15  february – 8  january 1642)  was an italian polymath  galileo is a central figure in the transition from natural philosophy to modern science and in the transformation of the scientific renaissance into a scientific revolution galileo s championing of heliocentrism and copernicanism was controversial during his lifetime  when most subscribed to either geocentrism or the tychonic he met with opposition from astronomers  who doubted heliocentrism because of the absence of an observed stellar the matter was investigated by the roman inquisition in 1615,  which concluded that heliocentrism was  foolish and absurd in philosophy  and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of holy galileo later defended his views in dialogue concerning the two chief world systems  which appeared to attack pope urban viii and thus alienated him and the jesuits  who had both supported galileo up until this he was tried by the inquisition  found  vehemently suspect of heresy   and forced to recant  he spent the rest of his life under house while under house arrest  he wrote one of his best-known  works  two new sciences  in which he summarized work he had done some forty years earlier on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of studied speed and velocity  gravity and free fall  the principle of relativity  inertia  projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology  describing the properties of pendulums and  hydrostatic balances   inventing the thermoscope and various military compasses  and using the telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects  his contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of venus  the discovery of the four largest satellites of jupiter  the observation of saturn s rings  though he could not see them well enough to discern their true nature  and the analysis of sunspots known for his work as astronomer  physicist  engineer  philosopher  and mathematician  galileo has been called the  father of observational the  father of modern the  father of the scientific and even the  father of was born in pisa  then part of the duchy of florence   italy  on 15  february the first of six children of vincenzo galilei  a famous lutenist  composer  and music theorist  and giulia  née ammannati   who had married in 1562.  galileo became an accomplished lutenist himself and would have learned early from his father a scepticism for established the value of well-measured  or quantified experimentation  an appreciation for a periodic or musical measure of time or rhythm  as well as the results expected from a combination of mathematics and experiment three of galileo s five siblings survived infancy  the youngest  michelangelo  or michelagnolo   also became a noted lutenist and composer although he contributed to financial burdens during galileo s young adulthood  michelangelo was unable to contribute his fair share of their father s promised dowries to their brothers-in-law,  who would later attempt to seek legal remedies for payments due  michelangelo would also occasionally have to borrow funds from galileo to support his musical endeavours and excursions  these financial burdens may have contributed to galileo s early desire to develop inventions that would bring him additional income when galileo galilei was eight  his family moved to florence  but he was left with jacopo borghini for two years  he then was educated in the vallombrosa abbey  about 30  km southeast of surname galilei derives from the given name of an ancestor  galileo bonaiuti  a physician  university teacher and politician who lived in florence from 1370  to 1450;  his descendents had changed their family name from bonaiuti  or buonaiuti  to galilei in his honor in the late 14th  galileo bonaiuti was buried in the same church  the basilica of santa croce in florence  where about 200  years later his more famous descendant galileo galilei was also needed it was common for mid-sixteenth  century tuscan families to name the eldest son after the parents  hence  galileo galilei was not necessarily named after his ancestor galileo bonaiuti  the italian male given name  galileo   and thence the surname  galilei   derives from the latin  galilaeus   meaning  of galilee   a biblically significant region in northern biblical roots of galileo s name and surname were to become the subject of a famous in 1614,  during the galileo affair  one of galileo s opponents  the dominican priest tommaso caccini  delivered against galileo a controversial and influential sermon  in it he made a point of quoting acts 1:11,   ye men of galilee  why stand ye gazing up into being a genuinely pious roman galileo fathered three children out of wedlock with marina gamba  they had two daughters  virginia  born in 1600)  and livia  born in 1601),  and a son  vincenzo  born in of their illegitimate birth  their father considered the girls unmarriageable  if not posing problems of prohibitively expensive support or dowries  which would have been similar to galileo s previous extensive financial problems with two of his their only worthy alternative was the religious life  both girls were accepted by the convent of san matteo in arcetri and remained there for the rest of their virginia took the name maria celeste upon entering the convent  she died on 2  april 1634,  and is buried with galileo at the basilica of santa croce  florence  livia took the name sister arcangela and was ill for most of her life  vincenzo was later legitimised as the legal heir of galileo and married sestilia galileo seriously considered the priesthood as a young man  at his father s urging he instead enrolled at the university of pisa for a medical in 1581,  when he was studying medicine  he noticed a swinging chandelier  which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs  to him  it seemed  by comparison with his heartbeat  that the chandelier took the same amount of time to swing back and forth  no matter how far it was swinging  when he returned home  he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together  it was not until the work of christiaan huygens  almost one hundred years later  that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate up to this point  galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics  since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician  however  after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry  he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of he created a thermoscope  a forerunner of the thermometer  and  in 1586,  published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented  which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world   galileo also studied disegno  a term encompassing fine art  and  in 1588,  obtained the position of instructor in the accademia delle arti del disegno in florence  teaching perspective and chiaroscuro  being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the renaissance artists  galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality  while a young teacher at the accademia  he began a lifelong friendship with the florentine painter cigoli  who included galileo s lunar observations in one of his 1589,  he was appointed to the chair of mathematics in pisa  in 1591,  his father died  and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother michelagnolo  in 1592,  he moved to the university of padua where he taught geometry  mechanics  and astronomy until during this period  galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science  for example  kinematics of motion and astronomy  as well as practical applied science  for example  strength of materials and pioneering the telescope   his multiple interests included the study of astrology  which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and bellarmine had written in 1615  that the copernican system could not be defended without  a true physical demonstration that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the galileo considered his theory of the tides to provide the required physical proof of the motion of the earth  this theory was so important to him that he originally intended to entitle his dialogue on the two chief world systems the dialogue on the ebb and flow of the the reference to tides was removed from the title by order of the inquisition for galileo  the tides were caused by the sloshing back and forth of water in the seas as a point on the earth s surface sped up and slowed down because of the earth s rotation on its axis and revolution around the sun  he circulated his first account of the tides in 1616,  addressed to cardinal his theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides  he correctly accounted  for instance  for the negligible tides halfway along the adriatic sea compared to those at the ends  as a general account of the cause of tides  however  his theory was a failure if this theory were correct  there would be only one high tide per day  galileo and his contemporaries were aware of this inadequacy because there are two daily high tides at venice instead of one  about twelve hours apart  galileo dismissed this anomaly as the result of several secondary causes including the shape of the sea  its depth  and other against the assertion that galileo was deceptive in making these arguments  albert einstein expressed the opinion that galileo developed his  fascinating arguments  and accepted them uncritically out of a desire for physical proof of the motion of the galileo dismissed the idea  held by his contemporary johannes kepler  that the moon caused the  galileo also took no interest in kepler s elliptical orbits of the 1619,  galileo became embroiled in a controversy with father orazio grassi  professor of mathematics at the jesuit collegio romano  it began as a dispute over the nature of comets  but by the time galileo had published the assayer  il saggiatore  in 1623,  his last salvo in the dispute  it had become a much wider controversy over the very nature of science itself  the title page of the book describes galileo as philosopher and  matematico primario  of the grand duke of tuscany because the assayer contains such a wealth of galileo s ideas on how science should be practised  it has been referred to as his scientific early in 1619,  father grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet  an astronomical disputation on the three comets of the year which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in november of the previous year  grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon  it must be farther away than the moon grassi s arguments and conclusions were criticised in a subsequent article  discourse on published under the name of one of galileo s disciples  a florentine lawyer named mario guiducci  although it had been largely written by galileo galileo and guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken  in its opening passage  galileo and guiducci s discourse gratuitously insulted the jesuit christopher and various uncomplimentary remarks about the professors of the collegio romano were scattered throughout the the jesuits were and grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own  the astronomical and philosophical under the pseudonym lothario sarsio purporting to be one of his own pupils the assayer was galileo s devastating reply to the astronomical it has been widely recognized as a masterpiece of polemical in which  sarsi s  arguments are subjected to withering it was greeted with wide acclaim  and particularly pleased the new pope  urban viii  to whom it had been in rome  in the previous decade  barberini  the future urban viii  had come down on the side of galileo and the lincean dispute with grassi permanently alienated many of the jesuits who had previously been sympathetic to his and galileo and his friends were convinced that these jesuits were responsible for bringing about his later the evidence for this is at best equivocal  the christian world prior to galileo s conflict with the church  the majority of educated people subscribed either to the aristotelian geocentric view that the earth was the center of the universe and that all heavenly bodies revolved around the or the tychonic system that blended geocentrism with nevertheless  following the death of copernicus and before galileo  heliocentrism was relatively copernicus s work was used by pope gregory xiii to reform the calendar in to heliocentrism and galileo s writings combined religious and scientific objections and were fueled by political events  scientific opposition came from tycho brahe and others and arose from the fact that  if heliocentrism were true  an annual stellar parallax should be observed  though none was  copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the stars were so distant  however  brahe had countered that  since stars appeared to have measurable size  if the stars were that distant  they would be gigantic  and in fact far larger than the sun or any other celestial body  in brahe s system  by contrast  the stars were a little more distant than saturn  and the sun and stars were comparable in opposition to heliocentrism arose from biblical references such as psalm 93:1,  96:10,  and 1  chronicles 16:30  which include text stating that  the world is firmly established  it cannot be moved   in the same manner  psalm 104:5  says   the lord set the earth on its foundations  it can never be moved   further  ecclesiastes 1:5  states that  and the sun rises and sets and returns to its defended heliocentrism based on his astronomical observations of 1609   sidereus nuncius 1610).  in december 1613,  the grand duchess christina of florence confronted one of galileo s friends and followers  benedetto castelli  with biblical objections to the motion of the earth  according to maurice finocchiaro  this was done in a friendly and gracious manner  out of curiosity  prompted by this incident  galileo wrote a letter to castelli in which he argued that heliocentrism was actually not contrary to biblical texts  and that the bible was an authority on faith and morals  not on science  this letter was not published  but circulated 1615,  galileo s writings on heliocentrism had been submitted to the roman inquisition by father niccolo lorini  who claimed that galileo and his followers were attempting to reinterpret the bible  which was seen as a violation of the council of trent and looked dangerously like lorini specifically cited galileo s letter to galileo went to rome to defend himself and his copernican and biblical ideas  at the start of 1616,  monsignor francesco ingoli initiated a debate with galileo  sending him an essay disputing the copernican system  galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the action against copernicanism that according to maurice finocchiaro  ingoli had probably been commissioned by the inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy  and the essay provided the  chief direct basis  for the inquisition s the essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism  it borrowed primarily from the arguments of tycho brahe  and it notedly mentioned brahe s argument that heliocentrism required the stars to be much larger than the sun  ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory  clearly proves     the fixed stars to be of such size  as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the earth the essay also included four theological arguments  but ingoli suggested galileo focus on the physical and mathematical arguments  and he did not mention galileo s biblical in february 1616,  an inquisitorial commission declared heliocentrism to be  foolish and absurd in philosophy  and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of holy scripture   the inquisition found that the idea of the earth s movement  receives the same judgement in philosophy and    in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in  the original document from the inquisitorial commission was made widely available in paul v instructed cardinal bellarmine to deliver this finding to galileo  and to order him to abandon the opinion that heliocentrism was physically true  on 26  february  galileo was called to bellarmine s residence and ordered     to abandon completely    the opinion that the sun stands still at the center of the world and the earth moves  and henceforth not to hold  teach  or defend it in any way whatever  either orally or in decree of the congregation of the index banned copernicus s de revolutionibus and other heliocentric works until bellarmine s instructions did not prohibit galileo from discussing heliocentrism as a mathematical and philosophic idea  so long as he did not advocate for its physical the next decade  galileo stayed well away from the controversy  he revived his project of writing a book on the subject  encouraged by the election of cardinal maffeo barberini as pope urban viii in 1623.  barberini was a friend and admirer of galileo  and had opposed the condemnation of galileo in 1616.  galileo s resulting book  dialogue concerning the two chief world systems  was published in 1632,  with formal authorization from the inquisition and papal pope urban viii had personally asked galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in the book  and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism  he made another request  that his own views on the matter be included in galileo s book  only the latter of those requests was fulfilled by galileo whether unknowingly or deliberately  simplicio  the defender of the aristotelian geocentric view in dialogue concerning the two chief world systems  was often caught in his own errors and sometimes came across as a fool  indeed  although galileo states in the preface of his book that the character is named after a famous aristotelian philosopher  simplicius in latin   simplicio  in italian   the name  simplicio  in italian also has the connotation of this portrayal of simplicio made dialogue concerning the two chief world systems appear as an advocacy book  an attack on aristotelian geocentrism and defence of the copernican theory  unfortunately for his relationship with the pope  galileo put the words of urban viii into the mouth of simplicio most historians agree galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his however  the pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly  nor the copernican advocacy galileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters  the pope  and was called to rome to defend his in september 1632.  he finally arrived in february 1633  and was brought before inquisitor vincenzo maculani to be charged  throughout his trial  galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616  he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions  and initially he denied even defending them  however  he was eventually persuaded to admit that  contrary to his true intention  a reader of his dialogue could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of copernicanism  in view of galileo s rather implausible denial that he had ever held copernican ideas after 1616  or ever intended to defend them in the dialogue  his final interrogation  in july 1633,  concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth  but he maintained his denial despite the sentence of the inquisition was delivered on 22  june  it was in three essential parts according to popular legend  after recanting his theory that the earth moved around the sun  galileo allegedly muttered the rebellious phrase  and yet it moves   a 1640s  painting by the spanish painter bartolomé esteban murillo or an artist of his school  in which the words were hidden until restoration work in 1911,  depicts an imprisoned galileo apparently gazing at the words  e pur si muove  written on the wall of his dungeon  the earliest known written account of the legend dates to a century after his death  but stillman drake writes  there is no doubt now that the famous words were already attributed to galileo before his a period with the friendly ascanio piccolomini  the archbishop of siena   galileo was allowed to return to his villa at arcetri near florence in 1634,  where he spent the remainder of his life under house arrest  galileo was ordered to read the seven penitential psalms once a week for the next three years  however  his daughter maria celeste relieved him of the burden after securing ecclesiastical permission to take it upon was while galileo was under house arrest that he dedicated his time to one of his finest works  two new sciences  here he summarised work he had done some forty years earlier  on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials  published in holland to avoid the censor  this book has received high praise from albert as a result of this work  galileo is often called the  father of modern physics   he went completely blind in 1638  and was suffering from a painful hernia and insomnia  so he was permitted to travel to florence for medical sobel argues that prior to galileo s 1633  trial and judgement for heresy  pope urban viii had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state  and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life  in this context  sobel argues that the problem of galileo was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of galileo  having been accused of weakness in defending the church  urban reacted against galileo out of anger and continued to receive visitors until 1642,  when  after suffering fever and heart palpitations  he died on 8  january 1642,  aged the grand duke of tuscany  ferdinando ii  wished to bury him in the main body of the basilica of santa croce  next to the tombs of his father and other ancestors  and to erect a marble mausoleum in his plans were dropped  however  after pope urban viii and his nephew  cardinal francesco barberini  because galileo had been condemned by the catholic church for  vehement suspicion of he was instead buried in a small room next to the novices  chapel at the end of a corridor from the southern transept of the basilica to the he was reburied in the main body of the basilica in 1737  after a monument had been erected there in his during this move  three fingers and a tooth were removed from his one of these fingers  the middle finger from galileo s right hand  is currently on exhibition at the museo galileo in florence  made original contributions to the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and more typical of science at the time were the qualitative studies of william gilbert  on magnetism and electricity  galileo s father  vincenzo galilei  a lutenist and music theorist  had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear  relation in physics  for a stretched string  the pitch varies as the square root of the these observations lay within the framework of the pythagorean tradition of music  well-known  to instrument makers  which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale  thus  a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science  and young galileo could see his own father s observations expand on that was one of the first modern thinkers to clearly state that the laws of nature are mathematical  in the assayer  he wrote  philosophy is written in this grand book  the universe     it is written in the language of mathematics  and its characters are triangles  circles  and other geometric his mathematical analyses are a further development of a tradition employed by late scholastic natural philosophers  which galileo learned when he studied his work marked another step towards the eventual separation of science from both philosophy and religion  a major development in human thought  he was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation  in order to perform his experiments  galileo had to set up standards of length and time  so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion  this provided a reliable foundation on which to confirm mathematical laws using inductive reasoning galileo showed a modern appreciation for the proper relationship between mathematics  theoretical physics  and experimental physics  he understood the parabola  both in terms of conic sections and in terms of the ordinate  y  varying as the square of the abscissa  x   galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances  he conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory  noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the earth could not possibly be a but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day  the deviation of a projectile s trajectory from a parabola would be only very only on uncertain descriptions of the first practical telescope which hans lippershey tried to patent in the netherlands in galileo  in the following year  made a telescope with about 3x  magnification  he later made improved versions with up to about 30x  with a galilean telescope  the observer could see magnified  upright images on the earth—it was what is commonly known as a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass  he could also use it to observe the sky  for a time he was one of those who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose  on 25  august 1609,  he demonstrated one of his early telescopes  with a magnification of about 8  or 9,  to venetian lawmakers  his telescopes were also a profitable sideline for galileo  who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade  he published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in march 1610  in a brief treatise entitled sidereus nuncius  starry and others had observed the supernova of 1572.  ottavio brenzoni s letter of 15  january 1605  to galileo brought the 1572  supernova and the less bright nova of 1601  to galileo s notice  galileo observed and discussed kepler s supernova in 1604.  since these new stars displayed no detectable diurnal parallax  galileo concluded that they were distant stars  and  therefore  disproved the aristotelian belief in the immutability of the 7  january 1610,  galileo observed with his telescope what he described at the time as  three fixed stars  totally by their smallness   all close to jupiter  and lying on a straight line through observations on subsequent nights showed that the positions of these  stars  relative to jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars  on 10  january  galileo noted that one of them had disappeared  an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind jupiter  within a few days  he concluded that they were orbiting he had discovered three of jupiter s four largest moons  he discovered the fourth on 13  january  galileo named the group of four the medicean stars  in honour of his future patron  cosimo ii de  medici  grand duke of tuscany  and cosimo s three later astronomers  however  renamed them galilean satellites in honour of their discoverer  these satellites are now called io  europa  ganymede  and callisto his observations of the satellites of jupiter caused a revolution in astronomy  a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform to the principles of aristotelian cosmology  which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that galileo could have discovered such a his observations were confirmed by the observatory of christopher clavius and he received a hero s welcome when he visited rome in galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months  and by mid-1611,  he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a feat which kepler had believed september 1610,  galileo observed that venus exhibited a full set of phases similar to that of the moon  the heliocentric model of the solar system developed by nicolaus copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of venus around the sun would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the earth when it was on the opposite side of the sun and to face away from the earth when it was on the earth-side  of the sun  on the other hand  in ptolemy s geocentric model it was impossible for any of the planets  orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the sun  traditionally  the orbit of venus was placed entirely on the near side of the sun  where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases  it was  however  also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the sun  where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases  after galileo s telescopic observations of the crescent  gibbous and full phases of venus  therefore  this ptolemaic model became untenable  thus in the early 17th  century  as a result of his discovery  the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric  planetary such as the tychonic  capellan and extended capellan each either with or without a daily rotating earth  these all had the virtue of explaining the phases of venus without the vice of the  refutation  of full heliocentrism s prediction of stellar parallax  galileo s discovery of the phases of venus was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage  transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism.galileo  observed the planet saturn  and at first mistook its rings for planets  thinking it was a three-bodied  system  when he observed the planet later  saturn s rings were directly oriented at earth  causing him to think that two of the bodies had disappeared  the rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616,  further confusing also observed the planet neptune in 1612.  it appears in his notebooks as one of many unremarkable dim stars  he did not realise that it was a planet  but he did note its motion relative to the stars before losing track of made naked-eye  and telescopic studies of their existence raised another difficulty with the unchanging perfection of the heavens as posited in orthodox aristotelian celestial physics  an apparent annual variation in their trajectories  observed by francesco sizzi and others in also provided a powerful argument against both the ptolemaic system and the geoheliocentric system of tycho a dispute over claimed priority in the discovery of sunspots  and in their interpretation  led galileo to a long and bitter feud with the jesuit christoph scheiner  in the middle was mark welser  to whom scheiner had announced his discovery  and who asked galileo for his needed  in fact  there is little doubt that both of them were beaten by david fabricius and his son johannes prior to galileo s construction of his version of a telescope  thomas harriot  an english mathematician and explorer  had already used what he dubbed a  perspective tube  to observe the moon  reporting his observations  harriot noted only  strange spottednesse  in the waning of the crescent  but was ignorant to the cause  galileo  due in part to his artistic and the knowledge of had understood the patterns of light and shadow were  in fact  topographical markers  while not being the only one to observe the moon through a telescope  galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and craters  in his study  he also made topographical charts  estimating the heights of the mountains  the moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere  as aristotle claimed  and hardly the first  planet   an  eternal pearl to magnificently ascend into the heavenly empyrian   as put forth by dante galileo observed the milky way  previously believed to be nebulous  and found it to be a multitude of stars packed so densely that they appeared from earth to be clouds  he located many other stars too distant to be visible with the naked eye  he observed the double star mizar in ursa major in the starry messenger  galileo reported that stars appeared as mere blazes of light  essentially unaltered in appearance by the telescope  and contrasted them to planets  which the telescope revealed to be discs  but shortly thereafter  in his letters on sunspots  he reported that the telescope revealed the shapes of both stars and planets to be  quite round   from that point forward  he continued to report that telescopes showed the roundness of stars  and that stars seen through the telescope measured a few seconds of arc in he also devised a method for measuring the apparent size of a star without a telescope  as described in his dialogue concerning the two chief world systems  his method was to hang a thin rope in his line of sight to the star and measure the maximum distance from which it would wholly obscure the star  from his measurements of this distance and of the width of the rope  he could calculate the angle subtended by the star at his viewing in his dialogue  he reported that he had found the apparent diameter of a star of first magnitude to be no more than 5  arcseconds  and that of one of sixth magnitude to be about 5/6  arcseconds  like most astronomers of his day  galileo did not recognise that the apparent sizes of stars that he measured were spurious  caused by diffraction and atmospheric distortion  see seeing disk or airy disk   and did not represent the true sizes of stars  however  galileo s values were much smaller than previous estimates of the apparent sizes of the brightest stars  such as those made by tycho brahe  see magnitude  and enabled galileo to counter anti-copernican  arguments such as those made by tycho that these stars would have to be absurdly large for their annual parallaxes to be other astronomers such as simon marius  giovanni battista riccioli  and martinus hortensius made similar measurements of stars  and marius and riccioli concluded the smaller sizes were not small enough to answer tycho s made a number of contributions to what is now known as engineering  as distinct from pure physics  between 1595  and 1598,  galileo devised and improved a geometric and military compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors  this expanded on earlier instruments designed by niccolò tartaglia and guidobaldo del monte  for gunners  it offered  in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately  a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials  as a geometric instrument  it enabled the construction of any regular polygon  computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector  and a variety of other calculations  under galileo s direction  instrument maker marc antonio mazzoleni produced more than 100  of these compasses  which galileo sold  along with an instruction manual he wrote  for 50  lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120  about 1593,  galileo constructed a thermometer  using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an attached tube in 1609,  galileo was  along with englishman thomas harriot and others  among the first to use a refracting telescope as an instrument to observe stars  planets or moons  the name  telescope  was coined for galileo s instrument by a greek mathematician  giovanni at a banquet held in 1611  by prince federico cesi to make galileo a member of his accademia dei the name was derived from the greek tele    far  and skopein    to look or see   in 1610,  he used a telescope at close range to magnify the parts of by 1624,  galileo had a compound microscope  he gave one of these instruments to cardinal zollern in may of that year for presentation to the duke of and in september  he sent another to prince the linceans played a role again in naming the  microscope  a year later when fellow academy member giovanni faber coined the word for galileo s invention from the greek words μικρόν  micron  meaning  small   and σκοπεῖν  skopein  meaning  to look at   the word was meant to be analogous with illustrations of insects made using one of galileo s microscopes and published in 1625,  appear to have been the first clear documentation of the use of a compound 1612,  having determined the orbital periods of jupiter s satellites  galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of their orbits  one could use their positions as a universal clock  and this would make possible the determination of longitude  he worked on this problem from time to time during the remainder of his life  but the practical problems were severe  the method was first successfully applied by giovanni domenico cassini in 1681  and was later used extensively for large land surveys  this method  for example  was used to survey france  and later by zebulon pike of the midwestern united states in 1806.  for sea navigation  where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult  the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable marine chronometer  such as that of john late in his life  when totally blind  galileo designed an escapement mechanism for a pendulum clock  called galileo s escapement   although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by christiaan huygens in the 1650s.galileo  was invited on several occasions to advise on engineering schemes to alleviate river flooding  in 1630  mario guiducci was probably instrumental in ensuring that he was consulted on a scheme by bartolotti to cut a new channel for the bisenzio river near theoretical and experimental work on the motions of bodies  along with the largely independent work of kepler and rené descartes  was a precursor of the classical mechanics developed by sir isaac newton  galileo conducted several experiments with pendulums  it is popularly believed  thanks to the biography by vincenzo viviani  that these began by watching the swings of the bronze chandelier in the cathedral of pisa  using his pulse as a timer  later experiments are described in his two new sciences  galileo claimed that a simple pendulum is isochronous  i e  that its swings always take the same amount of time  independently of the amplitude  in fact  this is only approximately as was discovered by christiaan huygens  galileo also found that the square of the period varies directly with the length of the pendulum  galileo s son  vincenzo  sketched a clock based on his father s theories in 1642.  the clock was never built and  because of the large swings required by its verge escapement  would have been a poor timekeeper   see engineering above  galileo is lesser known for  yet still credited with  being one of the first to understand sound frequency  by scraping a chisel at different speeds  he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel s skips  a measure of frequency  in 1638,  galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers  each having lanterns equipped with shutters  observe each other s lanterns at some distance  the first observer opens the shutter of his lamp  and  the second  upon seeing the light  immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern  the time between the first observer s opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer s lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers  galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile  he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared sometime between galileo s death and 1667,  the members of the florentine accademia del cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive we now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods  with human shutter-openers  on earth  galileo put forward the basic principle of relativity  that the laws of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line  regardless of its particular speed or direction  hence  there is no absolute motion or absolute rest  this principle provided the basic framework for newton s laws of motion and is central to einstein s special theory of relativity a biography by galileo s pupil vincenzo viviani stated that galileo had dropped balls of the same material  but different masses  from the leaning tower of pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their this was contrary to what aristotle had taught  that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones  in direct proportion to while this story has been retold in popular accounts  there is no account by galileo himself of such an experiment  and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take an exception is who argues that the experiment did take place  more or less as viviani described it  the experiment described was actually performed by simon stevin  commonly known as stevinus  and jan cornets de although the building used was actually the church tower in delft in however  most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and air resistance were much reduced in his 1638  discorsi  galileo s character salviati  widely regarded as galileo s spokesman  held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite speed in a vacuum  but this had previously been proposed by and simon cristiano banti s salviati also held it could be experimentally demonstrated by the comparison of pendulum motions in air with bobs of lead and of cork which had different weight but which were otherwise similar galileo proposed that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration  as long as the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible  or in the limiting case of its falling through a he also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest—namely  that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time   d ∝ t 2  prior to galileo  nicole oresme  in the 14th  century  had derived the times-squared  law for uniformly accelerated and domingo de soto had suggested in the 16th  century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly galileo expressed the time-squared  law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words  adhering to the standards of the day   it remained for others to re-express  the law in algebraic terms  he also concluded that objects retain their velocity in the absence of any impediments to their needed  thereby contradicting the generally accepted aristotelian hypothesis that a body could only remain in so-called   violent    unnatural   or  forced  motion so long as an agent of change  the  mover   continued to act on philosophical ideas relating to inertia had been proposed by john philoponus and jean buridan  galileo stated   imagine any particle projected along a horizontal plane without friction  then we know  from what has been more fully explained in the preceding pages  that this particle will move along this same plane with a motion which is uniform and perpetual  provided the plane has no this was incorporated into newton s laws of motion  first law  while galileo s application of mathematics to experimental physics was innovative  his mathematical methods were the standard ones of the day  including dozens of examples of an inverse proportion square root method passed down from fibonacci and archimedes  the analysis and proofs relied heavily on the eudoxian theory of proportion  as set forth in the fifth book of euclid s elements  this theory had become available only a century before  thanks to accurate translations by tartaglia and others  but by the end of galileo s life  it was being superseded by the algebraic methods of descartes the concept now named galileo s paradox was not original with him  his proposed solution  that infinite numbers cannot be compared  is no longer considered useful the galileo affair was largely forgotten after galileo s death  and the controversy subsided  the inquisition s ban on reprinting galileo s works was lifted in 1718  when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works  excluding the condemned dialogue  in in 1741,  pope benedict xiv authorised the publication of an edition of galileo s complete scientific which included a mildly censored version of the in 1758,  the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from the index of prohibited books  although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the dialogue and copernicus s de revolutionibus all traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835  when these works were finally dropped from the in the galileo affair was revived in the early 19th  century  when protestant polemicists used it  and other events such as the spanish inquisition and the myth of the flat earth  to attack roman interest in it has waxed and waned ever since  in 1939,  pope pius xii  in his first speech to the pontifical academy of sciences  within a few months of his election to the papacy  described galileo as being among the  most audacious heroes of research    not afraid of the stumbling blocks and the risks on the way  nor fearful of the funereal his close advisor of 40  years  professor robert leiber  wrote   pius xii was very careful not to close any doors  to science  prematurely  he was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of 15  february 1990,  in a speech delivered at the sapienza university of cardinal ratzinger  later to become pope benedict xvi  cited some current views on the galileo affair as forming what he called  a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep the self-doubt  of the modern age  of science and technology goes some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher paul feyerabend  whom he quoted as saying  the church at the time of galileo kept much more closely to reason than did galileo himself  and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of galileo s teaching too  her verdict against galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically the cardinal did not clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with feyerabend s assertions  he did  however  say  it would be foolish to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such 31  october 1992,  pope john paul ii expressed regret for how the galileo affair was handled  and issued a declaration acknowledging the errors committed by the catholic church tribunal that judged the scientific positions of galileo galilei  as the result of a study conducted by the pontifical council for in march 2008,  the head of the pontifical academy of sciences  nicola cabibbo  announced a plan to honour galileo by erecting a statue of him inside the vatican in december of the same year  during events to mark the 400th  anniversary of galileo s earliest telescopic observations  pope benedict xvi praised his contributions to a month later  however  the head of the pontifical council for culture  gianfranco ravasi  revealed that the plan to erect a statue of galileo in the grounds of the vatican had been to stephen hawking  galileo probably bears more of the responsibility for the birth of modern science than anybody and albert einstein called him the father of modern astronomical discoveries and investigations into the copernican theory have led to a lasting legacy which includes the categorisation of the four large moons of jupiter discovered by galileo  io  europa  ganymede and callisto  as the galilean moons  other scientific endeavours and principles are named after galileo including the galileo the first spacecraft to enter orbit around jupiter  the proposed galileo global satellite navigation system  the transformation between inertial systems in classical mechanics denoted galilean transformation and the gal  unit   sometimes known as the galileo  which is a non-si  unit of acceleration partly because 2009  was the fourth centenary of galileo s first recorded astronomical observations with the telescope  the united nations scheduled it to be the international year of a global scheme was laid out by the international astronomical union  iau   also endorsed by unesco—the un body responsible for educational  scientific and cultural matters  the international year of astronomy 2009  was intended to be a global celebration of astronomy and its contributions to society and culture  stimulating worldwide interest not only in astronomy but science in general  with a particular slant towards young people asteroid 697  galilea is named in his honour galileo is mentioned several times in the  opera  section of the queen song   bohemian he features prominently in the song  galileo  performed by the indigo girls and amy grant s galileo on her heart in motion album.twentieth-century  plays have been written on galileo s life  including life of galileo (1943)  by the german playwright bertolt brecht  with a film adaptation (1975)  of it  and lamp at midnight (1947)  by barrie as well as the 2008  play  galileo stanley robinson wrote a science fiction novel entitled galileo s dream (2009),  in which galileo is brought into the future to help resolve a crisis of scientific philosophy  the story moves back and forth between galileo s own time and a hypothetical distant future and contains a great deal of biographical galilei was recently selected as a main motif for a high value collectors  coin  the €25  international year of astronomy commemorative coin  minted in 2009.  this coin also commemorates the 400th  anniversary of the invention of galileo s telescope  the obverse shows a portion of his portrait and his telescope  the background shows one of his first drawings of the surface of the moon  in the silver ring  other telescopes are depicted  the isaac newton telescope  the observatory in kremsmünster abbey  a modern telescope  a radio telescope and a space telescope  in 2009,  the galileoscope was also released  this is a mass-produced,  low-cost  educational 2-inch  (51  mm  telescope with relatively high quality galileo s early works describing scientific instruments include the 1586  tract entitled the little balance  la billancetta  describing an accurate balance to weigh objects in air or and the 1606  printed manual le operazioni del compasso geometrico et militare on the operation of a geometrical and military early works in dynamics  the science of motion and mechanics were his circa 1590  pisan de motu  on motion  and his circa 1600  paduan le meccaniche  mechanics   the former was based on aristotelian–archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess of a body s specific weight over that of the medium  whereby in a vacuum  bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights  it also subscribed to the philoponan impetus dynamics in which impetus is self-dissipating  and free-fall  in a vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration galileo s 1610  the starry messenger  sidereus nuncius  was the first scientific treatise to be published based on observations made through a telescope  it reported his discoveries of galileo published a description of sunspots in 1613  entitled letters on suggesting the sun and heavens are corruptible  the letters on sunspots also reported his 1610  telescopic observations of the full set of phases of venus  and his discovery of the puzzling  appendages  of saturn and their even more puzzling subsequent disappearance  in 1615,  galileo prepared a manuscript known as the  letter to the grand duchess christina  which was not published in printed form until 1636.  this letter was a revised version of the letter to castelli  which was denounced by the inquisition as an incursion upon theology by advocating copernicanism both as physically true and as consistent with in 1616,  after the order by the inquisition for galileo not to hold or defend the copernican position  galileo wrote the  discourse on the tides   discorso sul flusso e il reflusso del mare  based on the copernican earth  in the form of a private letter to cardinal in 1619,  mario guiducci  a pupil of galileo s  published a lecture written largely by galileo under the title discourse on the comets  discorso delle comete   arguing against the jesuit interpretation of 1623,  galileo published the assayer—il saggiatore  which attacked theories based on aristotle s authority and promoted experimentation and the mathematical formulation of scientific ideas  the book was highly successful and even found support among the higher echelons of the christian following the success of the assayer  galileo published the dialogue concerning the two chief world systems  dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo  in 1632.  despite taking care to adhere to the inquisition s 1616  instructions  the claims in the book favouring copernican theory and a non geocentric model of the solar system led to galileo being tried and banned on publication  despite the publication ban  galileo published his discourses and mathematical demonstrations relating to two new sciences  discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche  intorno a due nuove scienze  in 1638  in holland  outside the jurisdiction of the inquisition galileo s main written works are as follows
