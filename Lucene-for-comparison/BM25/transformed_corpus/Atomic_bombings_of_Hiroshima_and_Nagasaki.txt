 atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki -  wikipediahiroshima nagasaki southeast asiasouthwest pacificnorth americajapanmanchuriaduring the final stage of world war ii  the united states dropped nuclear weapons on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki on august 6  and 9,  1945,  respectively  the united states had dropped the bombs with the consent of the united kingdom as outlined in the quebec agreement  the two bombings killed at least 129,000  people  most of whom were civilians  and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in the history of warfare in the final year of the war  the allies prepared for what was anticipated to be a very costly invasion of the japanese mainland  this undertaking was preceded by a u s  conventional and firebombing campaign that destroyed 67  japanese cities  the war in europe had concluded when germany signed its instrument of surrender on may 8,  1945,  which was eight days after adolf hitler committed suicide  the japanese were facing the same fate but refused to accept the allies  demands for unconditional surrender  and the war in the pacific theatre continued  the allies called for the unconditional surrender of the imperial japanese armed forces in the potsdam declaration on july 26,  1945—the  alternative being  prompt and utter destruction   the japanese ignored the ultimatum and the war continued by august 1945,  the allies  manhattan project had produced two types of atomic bomb  and the 509th  composite group of the united states army air forces  usaaf  was equipped with the specialized silverplate version of the boeing b-29  superfortress that could deliver them from tinian in the mariana islands  orders for atomic bombs to be used on four japanese cities were issued on july 25.  on august 6,  the u s  dropped a uranium gun-type   little boy  bomb on hiroshima  and american president harry s  truman called for japan s surrender  warning it to  expect a rain of ruin from the air  the like of which has never been seen on this earth   three days later  on august 9,  a plutonium implosion-type   fat man  bomb was dropped on nagasaki  within the first two to four months following the bombings  the acute effects of the atomic bombings had killed 90,000–146,000  people in hiroshima and 39,000–80,000  in nagasaki  roughly half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day  during the following months  large numbers died from the effect of burns  radiation sickness  and other injuries  compounded by illness and malnutrition  in both cities  most of the dead were civilians  although hiroshima had a sizable military garrison japan announced its surrender to the allies on august 15,  six days after the bombing of nagasaki and the soviet union s declaration of war  on september 2,  the japanese government signed the instrument of surrender  effectively ending world war ii  the justification for the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki is still debated to this day in 1945,  the pacific war between the empire of japan and the allies entered its fourth year  the japanese fought fiercely  ensuring that the allied victory would come at an enormous cost  the 1.25  million battle casualties that were incurred by the united states in world war ii included both military personnel killed in action and wounded in action  nearly one million of the casualties occurred during the last year of the war  from june 1944  to june 1945.  in december 1944,  american battle casualties hit an all-time  monthly high of 88,000  as a result of the german ardennes in the pacific  the allies returned to the recaptured and invaded offensives were undertaken to reduce the japanese forces remaining in bougainville  new guinea and the in april 1945,  american forces landed on okinawa  where heavy fighting continued until june  along the way  the ratio of japanese to american casualties dropped from 5:1  in the philippines to 2:1  on some japanese soldiers were taken prisoner  most fought until they were killed or committed suicide  nearly 99%  of the 21,000  defenders of iwo jima were killed  of the 117,000  japanese troops defending okinawa in april–june 1945,  94%  were killed  american military leaders used these figures to estimate high casualties among american soldiers in the planned invasion of the allies advanced towards japan  conditions became steadily worse for the japanese people  japan s merchant fleet declined from 5,250,000  gross tons in 1941  to 1,560,000  tons in march 1945,  and 557,000  tons in august 1945.  lack of raw materials forced the japanese war economy into a steep decline after the middle of 1944.  the civilian economy  which had slowly deteriorated throughout the war  reached disastrous levels by the middle of 1945.  the loss of shipping also affected the fishing fleet  and the 1945  catch was only 22%  of that in 1941.  the 1945  rice harvest was the worst since 1909,  and hunger and malnutrition became widespread  u s  industrial production was overwhelmingly superior to japan s  by 1943,  the u s  produced almost 100,000  aircraft a year  compared to japan s production of 70,000  for the entire war  by the middle of 1944,  the u s  had almost a hundred aircraft carriers in the pacific  far more than japan s twenty-five  for the entire war  in february 1945,  prince fumimaro konoe advised the emperor hirohito that defeat was inevitable  and urged him to before the surrender of nazi germany on may 8,  1945,  plans were underway for the largest operation of the pacific war  operation downfall  the invasion of the operation had two parts  operation olympic and operation coronet  set to begin in october 1945,  olympic involved a series of landings by the u s  sixth army intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main japanese island  operation olympic was to be followed in march 1946  by operation coronet  the capture of the kantō plain  near tokyo on the main japanese island of honshū by the u s  first  eighth and tenth armies  as well as a commonwealth corps made up of australian  british and canadian divisions  the target date was chosen to allow for olympic to complete its objectives  for troops to be redeployed from europe  and the japanese winter to geography made this invasion plan obvious to the japanese  they were able to predict the allied invasion plans accurately and thus adjust their defensive plan  operation ketsugō  accordingly  the japanese planned an all-out  defense of kyūshū  with little left in reserve for any subsequent defense four veteran divisions were withdrawn from the kwantung army in manchuria in march 1945  to strengthen the forces in and 45  new divisions were activated between february and may 1945.  most were immobile formations for coastal defense  but 16  were high quality mobile in all  there were 2.3  million japanese army troops prepared to defend the home islands  backed by a civilian militia of 28  million men and women  casualty predictions varied widely  but were extremely high  the vice chief of the imperial japanese navy general staff  vice admiral takijirō ōnishi  predicted up to 20  million japanese study from june 15,  1945,  by the joint war plans who provided planning information to the joint chiefs of staff  estimated that olympic would result in between 130,000  and 220,000  u s  casualties  of which u s  dead would be in the range from 25,000  to 46,000.  delivered on june 15,  1945,  after insight gained from the battle of okinawa  the study noted japan s inadequate defenses due to the very effective sea blockade and the american firebombing campaign  the chief of staff of the united states army  general of the army george marshall  and the army commander in chief in the pacific  general of the army douglas macarthur  signed documents agreeing with the joint war plans committee americans were alarmed by the japanese buildup  which was accurately tracked through ultra secretary of war henry l  stimson was sufficiently concerned about high american estimates of probable casualties to commission his own study by quincy wright and william shockley  wright and shockley spoke with colonels james mccormack and dean rusk  and examined casualty forecasts by michael e  debakey and gilbert beebe  wright and shockley estimated the invading allies would suffer between 1.7  and 4  million casualties in such a scenario  of whom between 400,000  and 800,000  would be dead  while japanese fatalities would have been around 5  to 10  began contemplating the use of a weapon that was  readily available and which assuredly can decrease the cost in american poison gas  quantities of phosgene  mustard gas  tear gas and cyanogen chloride were moved to luzon from stockpiles in australia and new guinea in preparation for operation olympic  and macarthur ensured that chemical warfare service units were trained in their consideration was also given to using biological weapons against the united states had developed plans for an air campaign against japan prior to the pacific war  the capture of allied bases in the western pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944  when the long-ranged  boeing b-29  superfortress became ready for use in operation matterhorn involved india-based  b-29s  staging through bases around chengdu in china to make a series of raids on strategic targets in this effort failed to achieve the strategic objectives that its planners had intended  largely because of logistical problems  the bomber s mechanical difficulties  the vulnerability of chinese staging bases  and the extreme range required to reach key japanese states army air forces  usaaf  brigadier general haywood s  hansell determined that guam  tinian  and saipan in the mariana islands would better serve as b-29  bases  but they were in japanese strategies were shifted to accommodate the air and the islands were captured between june and august 1944.  air bases were and b-29  operations commenced from the marianas in october these bases were easily resupplied by cargo the xxi bomber command began missions against japan on november 18,  early attempts to bomb japan from the marianas proved just as ineffective as the china-based  b-29s  had been  hansell continued the practice of conducting so-called  high-altitude  precision bombing  aimed at key industries and transportation networks  even after these tactics had not produced acceptable these efforts proved unsuccessful due to logistical difficulties with the remote location  technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft  unfavorable weather conditions  and enemy successor  major general curtis lemay  assumed command in january 1945  and initially continued to use the same precision bombing tactics  with equally unsatisfactory results  the attacks initially targeted key industrial facilities but much of the japanese manufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private under pressure from usaaf headquarters in washington  lemay changed tactics and decided that low-level  incendiary raids against japanese cities were the only way to destroy their production capabilities  shifting from precision bombing to area bombardment with most strategic bombing during world war ii  the aim of the usaaf offensive against japan was to destroy the enemy s war industries  kill or disable civilian employees of these industries  and undermine civilian morale  civilians who took part in the war effort through such activities as building fortifications and manufacturing munitions and other war materials in factories and workshops were considered combatants in a legal sense and therefore liable to be the next six months  the xxi bomber command under lemay firebombed 67  japanese cities  the firebombing of tokyo  codenamed operation meetinghouse  on march 9–10  killed an estimated 100,000  people and destroyed 16  square miles (41  km2)  of the city and 267,000  buildings in a single night  it was the deadliest bombing raid of the war  at a cost of 20  b-29s  shot down by flak and by may  75%  of bombs dropped were incendiaries designed to burn down japan s  paper cities   by mid-june,  japan s six largest cities had been the end of the fighting on okinawa that month provided airfields even closer to the japanese mainland  allowing the bombing campaign to be further escalated  aircraft flying from allied aircraft carriers and the ryukyu islands also regularly struck targets in japan during 1945  in preparation for operation firebombing switched to smaller cities  with populations ranging from 60,000  to 350,000.  according to yuki tanaka  the u s  fire-bombed  over a hundred japanese towns and these raids were also japanese military was unable to stop the allied attacks and the country s civil defense preparations proved inadequate  japanese fighters and antiaircraft guns had difficulty engaging bombers flying at high from april 1945,  the japanese interceptors also had to face american fighter escorts based on iwo jima and that month  the imperial japanese army air service and imperial japanese navy air service stopped attempting to intercept the air raids in order to preserve fighter aircraft to counter the expected by mid-1945  the japanese only occasionally scrambled aircraft to intercept individual b-29s  conducting reconnaissance sorties over the country  in order to conserve supplies of by july 1945,  the japanese had stockpiled 1,156,000  us barrels (137,800,000  l  36,400,000  us gal  30,300,000  imp gal  of avgas for the invasion of while the japanese military decided to resume attacks on allied bombers from late june  by this time there were too few operational fighters available for this change of tactics to hinder the allied air discovery of nuclear fission by german chemists otto hahn and fritz strassmann in 1938,  and its theoretical explanation by lise meitner and otto frisch  made the development of an atomic bomb a theoretical fears that a german atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons first  especially among scientists who were refugees from nazi germany and other fascist countries  were expressed in the einstein-szilard  letter  this prompted preliminary research in the united states in late progress was slow until the arrival of the british maud committee report in late 1941,  which indicated that only 5–10  kilograms of isotopically enriched uranium-235  was needed for a bomb instead of tons of un-enriched  uranium and a neutron moderator  e g  heavy in collaboration with the united kingdom and canada  with their respective projects tube alloys and chalk river the manhattan project  under the direction of major general leslie r  groves  jr   of the u s  army corps of engineers  designed and built the first atomic groves appointed j  robert oppenheimer to organize and head the project s los alamos laboratory in new mexico  where bomb design work was carried two types of bombs were eventually developed  little boy was a gun-type  fission weapon that used uranium-235,  a rare isotope of uranium separated at the clinton engineer works at oak ridge  the other  known as a fat man device  both types named by robert serber   was a more powerful and efficient  but more complicated  implosion-type  nuclear weapon that used plutonium created in nuclear reactors at hanford  washington  a test implosion weapon  the gadget  was detonated at trinity site  on july 16,  1945,  near alamogordo  new was a japanese nuclear weapon program  but it lacked the human  mineral and financial resources of the manhattan project  and never made much progress towards developing an atomic 509th  composite group was constituted on december 9,  1944,  and activated on december 17,  1944,  at wendover army air field  utah  commanded by colonel paul tibbets was assigned to organize and command a combat group to develop the means of delivering an atomic weapon against targets in germany and japan  because the flying squadrons of the group consisted of both bomber and transport aircraft  the group was designated as a  composite  rather than a  bombardment  with the manhattan project at los alamos  tibbets selected wendover for his training base over great bend  kansas  and mountain home  idaho  because of its each bombardier completed at least 50  practice drops of inert or conventional explosive pumpkin bombs and tibbets declared his group 509th  composite group had an authorized strength of 225  officers and 1,542  enlisted men  almost all of whom eventually deployed to tinian  in addition to its authorized strength  the 509th  had attached to it on tinian 51  civilian and military personnel from project known as the 1st  technical the 509th  composite group s 393d  bombardment squadron was equipped with 15  silverplate b-29s.  these aircraft were specially adapted to carry nuclear weapons  and were equipped with fuel-injected  engines  curtiss electric reversible-pitch  propellers  pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors and other ground support echelon of the 509th  composite group moved by rail on april 26,  1945,  to its port of embarkation at seattle  washington  on may 6  the support elements sailed on the ss cape victory for the marianas  while group materiel was shipped on the ss emile berliner  the cape victory made brief port calls at honolulu and eniwetok but the passengers were not permitted to leave the dock area  an advance party of the air echelon  consisting of 29  officers and 61  enlisted men flew by c-54  to north field on tinian  between may 15  and may were also two representatives from washington  d c   brigadier general thomas farrell  the deputy commander of the manhattan project  and rear admiral william r  purnell of the military policy who were on hand to decide higher policy matters on the spot  along with captain william s  parsons  the commander of project alberta  they became known as the  tinian joint april 1945,  marshall asked groves to nominate specific targets for bombing for final approval by himself and stimson  groves formed a target committee  chaired by himself  that included farrell  major john a  derry  colonel william p  fisher  joyce c  stearns and david m  dennison from the usaaf  and scientists john von neumann  robert r  wilson and william penney from the manhattan project  the target committee met in washington on april 27;  at los alamos on may 10,  where it was able to talk to the scientists and technicians there  and finally in washington on may 28,  where it was briefed by tibbets and commander frederick ashworth from project alberta  and the manhattan project s scientific advisor  richard c  target committee nominated five targets  kokura  the site of one of japan s largest munitions plants  hiroshima  an embarkation port and industrial center that was the site of a major military headquarters  yokohama  an urban center for aircraft manufacture  machine tools  docks  electrical equipment and oil refineries  niigata  a port with industrial facilities including steel and aluminum plants and an oil refinery  and kyoto  a major industrial center  the target selection was subject to the following criteria these cities were largely untouched during the nightly bombing raids and the army air forces agreed to leave them off the target list so accurate assessment of the weapon could be made  hiroshima was described as  an important army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area  it is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged  there are adjacent hills which are likely to produce a focusing effect which would considerably increase the blast damage  due to rivers it is not a good incendiary target committee stated that  it was agreed that psychological factors in the target selection were of great importance  two aspects of this are (1)  obtaining the greatest psychological effect against japan and (2)  making the initial use sufficiently spectacular for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized when publicity on it is released  kyoto had the advantage of being an important center for military industry  as well an intellectual center and hence a population better able to appreciate the significance of the weapon  the emperor s palace in tokyo has a greater fame than any other target but is of least strategic o  reischauer  a japan expert for the u s  army intelligence service  was incorrectly said to have prevented the bombing of in his autobiography  reischauer specifically refuted this claim     the only person deserving credit for saving kyoto from destruction is henry l  stimson  the secretary of war at the time  who had known and admired kyoto ever since his honeymoon there several decades may 30,  stimson asked groves to remove kyoto from the target list due to its historical  religious and cultural significance  but groves pointed to its military and industrial stimson then approached president harry s  truman about the matter  truman agreed with stimson  and kyoto was temporarily removed from the target groves attempted to restore kyoto to the target list in july  but stimson remained on july 25,  nagasaki was put on the target list in place of early may 1945,  the interim committee was created by stimson at the urging of leaders of the manhattan project and with the approval of truman to advise on matters pertaining to nuclear during the meetings on may 31  and june 1,  scientist ernest lawrence had suggested giving the japanese a non-combat  arthur compton later recalled that it was evident that everyone would suspect trickery  if a bomb were exploded in japan with previous notice  the japanese air power was still adequate to give serious interference  an atomic bomb was an intricate device  still in the developmental stage  its operation would be far from routine  if during the final adjustments of the bomb the japanese defenders should attack  a faulty move might easily result in some kind of failure  such an end to an advertised demonstration of power would be much worse than if the attempt had not been made  it was now evident that when the time came for the bombs to be used we should have only one of them available  followed afterwards by others at all-too-long  intervals  we could not afford the chance that one of them might be a dud  if the test were made on some neutral territory  it was hard to believe that japan s determined and fanatical military men would be impressed  if such an open test were made first and failed to bring surrender  the chance would be gone to give the shock of surprise that proved so effective  on the contrary  it would make the japanese ready to interfere with an atomic attack if they could  though the possibility of a demonstration that would not destroy human lives was attractive  no one could suggest a way in which it could be made so convincing that it would be likely to stop the possibility of a demonstration was raised again in the franck report issued by physicist james franck on june 11  and the scientific advisory panel rejected his report on june 16,  saying that  we can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war  we see no acceptable alternative to direct military use   franck then took the report to washington  d c   where the interim committee met on june 21  to re-examine  its earlier conclusions  but it reaffirmed that there was no alternative to the use of the bomb on a military compton  many u s  officials and scientists argued that a demonstration would sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack  and the japanese could deny the atomic bomb was lethal  making the mission less likely to produce surrender  allied prisoners of war might be moved to the demonstration site and be killed by the bomb  they also worried that the bomb might be a dud since the trinity test was of a stationary device  not an air-dropped  bomb  in addition  only two bombs would be available at the start of august  although more were in production  and they cost billions of dollars  so using one for a demonstration would be several months  the u s  had warned civilians of potential air raids by dropping more than 63  million leaflets across japan  many japanese cities suffered terrible damage from aerial bombings  some were as much as 97%  destroyed  lemay thought that leaflets would increase the psychological impact of bombing  and reduce the international stigma of area-bombing  cities  even with the warnings  japanese opposition to the war remained ineffective  in general  the japanese regarded the leaflet messages as truthful  with many japanese choosing to leave major cities  the leaflets caused such concern amongst the empire of japan that they ordered the arrest of anyone caught in possession of a leaflet texts were prepared by recent japanese prisoners of war because they were thought to be the best choice  to appeal to their preparation for dropping an atomic bomb on hiroshima  the oppenheimer-led  scientific panel of the interim committee decided against a demonstration bomb and against a special leaflet warning  those decisions were implemented because of the uncertainty of a successful detonation and also because of the wish to maximize shock in the no warning was given to hiroshima that a new and much more destructive bomb was going to be various sources gave conflicting information about when the last leaflets were dropped on hiroshima prior to the atomic bomb  robert jay lifton wrote that it was july and theodore h  mcnelly wrote that it was july the usaaf history noted that eleven cities were targeted with leaflets on july 27,  but hiroshima was not one of them  and there were no leaflet sorties on july leaflet sorties were undertaken on august 1  and august 4.  hiroshima may have been leafleted in late july or early august  as survivor accounts talk about a delivery of leaflets a few days before the atomic bomb was three versions were printed of a leaflet listing 11  or 12  cities targeted for firebombing  a total of 33  cities listed  with the text of this leaflet reading in japanese     we cannot promise that only these cities will be among those hiroshima is not the 1943  quebec agreement with the united kingdom  nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent  stimson therefore had to obtain british permission  a meeting of the combined policy committee was held at the pentagon on july 4,  1945.  stimson and vannevar bush represented the united states  britain was represented by the head of the british joint staff mission  field marshal sir henry maitland wilson  and canada by clarence d  howe  in addition  harvey bundy  sir james chadwick  groves  lord halifax  george l  harrison  and roger makins were all present at the meeting by announced that the british government concurred with the use of nuclear weapons against japan  which would be officially recorded as a decision of the combined policy as the release of information to third parties was also controlled by the quebec agreement  discussion then turned to what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the bombing  the meeting also considered what truman could reveal to joseph stalin  the leader of the soviet union  at the upcoming potsdam for the attack were issued to general carl spaatz on july 25  under the signature of general thomas t  handy  the acting chief of staff  since marshall was at the potsdam conference with that day  truman noted in his diary that this weapon is to be used against japan between now and august 10th.  i have told the sec  of war  mr  stimson  to use it so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children  even if the japs are savages  ruthless  merciless and fanatic  we as the leader of the world for the common welfare cannot drop that terrible bomb on the old capital or the new he and i are in accord  the target will be a purely military july 16  success of the trinity test in the new mexico desert exceeded on july 26,  allied leaders issued the potsdam declaration  which outlined the terms of surrender for japan  the declaration was presented as an ultimatum and stated that without a surrender  the allies would attack japan  resulting in  the inevitable and complete destruction of the japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the japanese homeland   the atomic bomb was not mentioned in the july 28,  japanese papers reported that the declaration had been rejected by the japanese government  that afternoon  prime minister suzuki kantarō declared at a press conference that the potsdam declaration was no more than a rehash  yakinaoshi  of the cairo declaration and that the government intended to ignore it  mokusatsu   kill by the statement was taken by both japanese and foreign papers as a clear rejection of the declaration  emperor hirohito  who was waiting for a soviet reply to non-committal  japanese peace feelers  made no move to change the government japan s willingness to surrender remained conditional on the preservation of the imperial institution  that japan not be occupied  that the japanese armed forces be disbanded voluntarily  and that war criminals be prosecuted by japanese potsdam  truman agreed to a request from winston churchill that britain be represented when the atomic bomb was dropped  william penney and group captain leonard cheshire were sent to tinian  but found that lemay would not let them accompany the mission  all they could do was send a strongly worded signal back to little boy bomb  except for the uranium payload  was ready at the beginning of may the uranium-235  projectile was completed on june 15,  and the target insert on july the target and bomb pre-assemblies   partly assembled bombs without the fissile components  left hunters point naval shipyard  california  on july 16  aboard the cruiser uss indianapolis  and arrived on tinian on july the target inserts followed by air on july first plutonium core  along with its polonium-beryllium  urchin initiator  was transported in the custody of project alberta courier raemer schreiber in a magnesium field carrying case designed for the purpose by philip morrison  magnesium was chosen because it does not act as a the core departed from kirtland army air field on a c-54  transport aircraft of the 509th  composite group s 320th  troop carrier squadron on july 26,  and arrived at north field july 28.  three fat man high-explosive  pre-assemblies,  designated f31,  f32,  and f33,  were picked up at kirtland on july 28  by three b-29s,  two from the 393d  bombardment squadron plus one from the 216th  army air force base unit  and transported to north field  arriving on august the time of its bombing  hiroshima was a city of both industrial and military significance  a number of military units were located nearby  the most important of which was the headquarters of field marshal shunroku hata s second general army  which commanded the defense of all of southern and was located in hiroshima castle  hata s command consisted of some 400,000  men  most of whom were on kyushu where an allied invasion was correctly also present in hiroshima were the headquarters of the 59th  army  the 5th  division and the 224th  division  a recently formed mobile the city was defended by five batteries of 7-cm  and 8-cm  (2.8  and 3.1  inch  anti-aircraft  guns of the 3rd  anti-aircraft  division  including units from the 121st  and 122nd  anti-aircraft  regiments and the 22nd  and 45th  separate anti-aircraft  battalions  in total  an estimated 40,000  japanese military personnel were stationed in the was a minor supply and logistics base for the japanese military  but it also had large stockpiles of military the city was also a communications center  a key port for shipping and an assembly area for it was a beehive of war industry  manufacturing parts for planes and boats  for bombs  rifles  and handguns  children were shown how to construct and hurl gasoline bombs and the wheelchair-bound  and bedridden were assembling booby traps to be planted in the beaches of kyushu  a new slogan appeared on the walls of hiroshima   forget self  all out for your it was also the second largest city in japan after kyoto that was still undamaged by air due to the fact that it lacked the aircraft manufacturing industry that was the xxi bomber command s priority target  on july 3,  the joint chiefs of staff placed it off limits to bombers  along with kokura  niigata and center of the city contained several reinforced concrete buildings and lighter structures  outside the center  the area was congested by a dense collection of small timber-made  workshops set among japanese houses  a few larger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city  the houses were constructed of timber with tile roofs  and many of the industrial buildings were also built around timber frames  the city as a whole was highly susceptible to fire population of hiroshima had reached a peak of over 381,000  earlier in the war but prior to the atomic bombing  the population had steadily decreased because of a systematic evacuation ordered by the japanese government  at the time of the attack  the population was approximately residents wondered why hiroshima had been spared destruction by some speculated that the city was to be saved for u s  occupation headquarters  others thought perhaps their relatives in hawaii and california had petitioned the u s  government to avoid bombing more realistic city officials had ordered buildings torn down to create long  straight firebreaks  beginning in firebreaks continued to be expanded and extended up to the morning of august 6,  was the primary target of the first nuclear bombing mission on august 6,  with kokura and nagasaki as alternative targets  having been fully briefed under the terms of operations order no  35,  the 393d  bombardment squadron b-29  enola gay  piloted by tibbets  took off from north field  tinian  about six hours  flight time from japan  the enola gay  named after tibbets  mother  was accompanied by two other b-29s.  the great artiste  commanded by major charles sweeney  carried instrumentation  and a then-nameless  aircraft later called necessary evil  commanded by captain george marquardt  served as the photography leaving tinian the aircraft made their way separately to iwo jima to rendezvous with sweeney and marquardt at 05:55  at 9,200  feet (2,800  and set course for japan  the aircraft arrived over the target in clear visibility at 31,060  feet (9,470  parsons  who was in command of the mission  armed the bomb during the flight to minimize the risks during

staff officer  after reporting to tokyo  began to organize relief measures  tokyo s first indication that the city had been destroyed by a new type of bomb came from president truman s announcement of the strike  sixteen hours the hiroshima bombing  truman issued a statement announcing the use of the new weapon  he stated   we may be grateful to providence  that the german atomic bomb project had failed  and that the united states and its allies had  spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history—and won   truman then warned japan   if they do not now accept our terms  they may expect a rain of ruin from the air  the like of which has never been seen on this earth  behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well this was a widely broadcast speech picked up by japanese news august the 50,000-watt  standard wave station on saipan the owi radio

after hiroshima was destroyed  dr  yoshio nishina and other atomic physicists arrived at the city  and carefully examined the damage  they then went back to tokyo and told the cabinet that hiroshima was indeed destroyed by an atomic bomb  admiral soemu toyoda  the chief of the naval general staff  estimated that no more than one or two additional bombs could be readied  so they decided to endure the remaining attacks  acknowledging  there would be more destruction but the war would go american magic codebreakers intercepted the cabinet s parsons  tibbets  spaatz  and lemay met on guam that same day to discuss what should be done since there was no indication of japan they decided to proceed with dropping another bomb  parsons said that project alberta would have it ready by august 11,  but tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm  and asked if the bomb could be readied by august 9.  parsons agreed to try to do city of nagasaki had been one of the largest seaports in southern japan  and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging  industrial activity  including the production of ordnance  ships  military equipment  and other war materials  the four largest companies in the city were mitsubishi shipyards  electrical shipyards  arms plant  and steel and arms works  which employed about 90%  of the city s labor force  and accounted for 90%  of the city s although an important industrial city  nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate at night with an/apq-13  the other target cities  nagasaki had not been placed off limits to bombers by the joint chiefs of staff s july 3  and was bombed on a small scale five times  during one of these raids on august 1,  a number of conventional high-explosive  bombs were dropped on the city  a few hit the shipyards and dock areas in the southwest portion of the city  and several hit the mitsubishi steel and arms by early august  the city was defended by the 134th  anti-aircraft  regiment of the 4th  anti-aircraft  division with four batteries of 7  cm (2.8  in  anti-aircraft  guns and two searchlight contrast to hiroshima  almost all of the buildings were of old-fashioned  japanese construction  consisting of timber or timber-framed  buildings with timber walls  with or without plaster  and tile roofs  many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of timber or other materials not designed to withstand explosions  nagasaki had been permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan  residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley  on the day of the bombing  an estimated 263,000  people were in nagasaki  including 240,000  japanese residents  10,000  korean residents  2,500  conscripted korean workers  9,000  japanese soldiers  600  conscripted chinese workers  and 400  allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of for the timing of the second bombing was delegated to tibbets  scheduled for august 11  against kokura  the raid was moved earlier by two days to avoid a five-day  period of bad weather forecast to begin on august three bomb pre-assemblies  had been transported to tinian  labeled f-31,  f-32,  and f-33  on their exteriors  on august 8,  a dress rehearsal was conducted off tinian by sweeney using bockscar as the drop airplane  assembly f-33  was expended testing the components and f-31  was designated for the august 9  03:49  on the morning of august 9,  1945,  bockscar  flown by sweeney s crew  carried fat man  with kokura as the primary target and nagasaki the secondary target  the mission plan for the second attack was nearly identical to that of the hiroshima mission  with two b-29s  flying an hour ahead as weather scouts and two additional b-29s  in sweeney s flight for instrumentation and photographic support of the mission  sweeney took off with his weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still pre-flight  inspection of bockscar  the flight engineer notified sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use 640  us gallons (2,400  l  530  imp gal  of fuel carried in a reserve tank  this fuel would still have to be carried all the way to japan and back  consuming still more fuel  replacing the pump would take hours  moving the fat man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well  as the bomb was live  tibbets and sweeney therefore elected to have bockscar continue the time penney and cheshire were allowed to accompany the mission  flying as observers on the third plane  big stink  flown by the group s operations officer  major james i  hopkins  jr  observers aboard the weather planes reported both targets clear  when sweeney s aircraft arrived at the assembly point for his flight off the coast of japan  big stink failed to make the according to cheshire  hopkins was at varying heights including 9,000  feet (2,700  m  higher than he should have been  and was not flying tight circles over yakushima as previously agreed with sweeney and captain frederick c  bock  who was piloting the support b-29  the great artiste  instead  hopkins was flying 40-mile  (64  km  dogleg though ordered not to circle longer than fifteen minutes  sweeney continued to wait for big stink  at the urging of ashworth  the plane s weaponeer  who was in command of the exceeding the original departure time limit by a half-hour,  bockscar  accompanied by the great artiste  proceeded to kokura  thirty minutes away  the delay at the rendezvous had resulted in clouds and drifting smoke over kokura from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224  b-29s  on nearby yahata the previous day  additionally  the yawata steel works intentionally burned coal tar  to produce black the clouds and smoke resulted in 70%  of the area over kokura being covered  obscuring the aiming point  three bomb runs were made over the next 50  minutes  burning fuel and exposing the aircraft repeatedly to the heavy defenses of yawata  but the bombardier was unable to drop visually  by the time of the third bomb run  japanese antiaircraft fire was getting close  and second lieutenant jacob beser  who was monitoring japanese communications  reported activity on the japanese fighter direction radio three runs over the city  and with fuel running low because of the failed fuel pump  they headed for their secondary target  fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach iwo jima and would be forced to divert to okinawa  which had become entirely allied-occupied  territory only six weeks earlier  after initially deciding that if nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary  ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was about 07:50  japanese time  an air raid alert was sounded in nagasaki  but the  all clear  signal was given at 08:30.  when only two b-29  superfortresses were sighted at 10:53,  the japanese apparently assumed that the planes were only on reconnaissance and no further alarm was few minutes later at 11:00,  the great artiste dropped instruments attached to three parachutes  these instruments also contained an unsigned letter to professor ryokichi sagane  a physicist at the university of tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the university of california  berkeley  urging him to tell the public about the danger involved with these weapons of mass destruction  the messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to sagane until a month in 1949,  one of the authors of the letter  luis alvarez  met with sagane and signed the 11:01,  a last-minute  break in the clouds over nagasaki allowed bockscar s bombardier  captain kermit beahan  to visually sight the target as ordered  the fat man weapon  containing a core of about 6.4  kg (14  lb  of plutonium  was dropped over the city s industrial valley at 32°46′25″n  129°51′48″e﻿    ﻿32.77372°n  129.86325°e﻿    32.77372;  129.86325.  it exploded 47  seconds later at 1,650  ± 33  ft (503  ± 10  m   above a tennis halfway between the mitsubishi steel and arms works in the south and the nagasaki arsenal in the north  this was nearly 3  km (1.9  mi  northwest of the planned hypocenter  the blast was confined to the urakami valley and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening the resulting explosion released the equivalent energy of 21  ± 2  kt (87.9  ±

away  and flew over to because of the delays in the mission and the inoperative fuel transfer pump  bockscar did not have sufficient fuel to reach the emergency landing field at iwo jima  so sweeney and bock flew to okinawa  arriving there  sweeney circled for 20  minutes trying to contact the control tower for landing clearance  finally concluding that his radio was faulty  critically low on fuel  bockscar barely made it to the runway on okinawa s yontan airfield  with enough fuel for only one landing attempt  sweeney and albury brought bockscar in at 150  miles per hour (240  km h  instead of the normal 120  miles per hour (190  km h   firing distress flares to alert the field of the uncleared landing  the number two engine died from fuel starvation as bockscar began its final approach  touching the runway hard  the heavy b-29  slewed left and towards a row of parked b-24  bombers before the pilots managed to regain control  the b-29's  reversible propellers were insufficient to slow the aircraft adequately  and with both pilots standing on the brakes  bockscar made a swerving 90-degree  turn at the end of the runway to avoid running off it  a second engine died from fuel exhaustion by the time the plane came to a stop  the flight engineer later measured fuel in the tanks and concluded that less than five minutes total the mission  there was confusion over the identification of the plane  the first eyewitness account by war correspondent william l  laurence of the new york times  who accompanied the mission aboard the aircraft piloted by bock  reported that sweeney was leading the mission in the great artiste  he also noted its  victor  number as 77,  which was that of laurence had interviewed sweeney and his crew  and was aware that they referred to their airplane as the great artiste  except for enola gay  none of the 393d's  b-29s  had yet had names painted on the noses  a fact which laurence himself noted in his account  unaware of the switch in aircraft  laurence assumed victor 77  was the great which was in fact  victor the bomb was more powerful than the one used on hiroshima  the effect was confined by hillsides to the narrow urakami of 7,500  japanese employees who worked inside the mitsubishi munitions plant  including  mobilized  conscripted students and regular workers  6,200  were killed  some 17,000–22,000  others who worked in other war plants and factories in the city died as casualty estimates for immediate deaths vary widely  ranging from 22,000  to at least 35,000–40,000  people were killed and 60,000  others in the days and months following the explosion  more people died from bomb effects  because of the presence of undocumented foreign workers  and a number of military personnel in transit  there are great discrepancies in the estimates of total deaths by the end of 1945;  a range of 39,000  to 80,000  can be found in various hiroshima s military death toll  only 150  japanese soldiers were killed instantly  including thirty-six  from the 134th  aaa regiment of the 4th  aaa at least eight known pows died from the bombing and as many as 13  may have died  including a british prisoner of war  royal air force corporal ronald and seven dutch one american pow  joe kieyoomia  was in nagasaki at the time of the bombing but survived  reportedly having been shielded from the effects of the bomb by the concrete walls of his there were 24  australian pows in nagasaki  all of whom radius of total destruction was about 1  mi (1.6  km   followed by fires across the northern portion of the city to 2  mi (3.2  km  south of the about 58%  of the mitsubishi arms plant was damaged  and about 78%  of the mitsubishi steel works  the mitsubishi electric works suffered only 10%  structural damage as it was on the border of the main destruction zone  the nagasaki arsenal was destroyed in the many fires likewise burnt following the bombing  in contrast to hiroshima where sufficient fuel density was available  no firestorm developed in nagasaki as the damaged areas did not furnish enough fuel to generate the phenomenon  instead  the ambient wind at the time pushed the fire spread along the expected to have another atomic bomb ready for use on august 19,  with three more in september and a further three in on august 10,  he sent a memorandum to marshall in which he wrote that  the next bomb     should be ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after 17  or 18  august   on the same day  marshall endorsed the memo with the comment   it is not to be released over japan without express authority from the truman had secretly requested this on august 10.  this modified the previous order that the target cities were to be attacked with atomic bombs  as made was already discussion in the war department about conserving the bombs then in production for operation downfall   the problem now 13]  is whether or not  assuming the japanese do not capitulate  to continue dropping them every time one is made and shipped out there or whether to hold them     and then pour them all on in a reasonably short time  not all in one day  but over a short period  and that also takes into consideration the target that we are after  in other words  should we not concentrate on targets that will be of the greatest assistance to an invasion rather than industry  morale  psychology  and the like  nearer the tactical use rather than other more fat man assemblies were readied  and scheduled to leave kirtland field for tinian on august 11  and and tibbets was ordered by lemay to return to albuquerque  new mexico  to collect at los alamos  technicians worked 24  hours straight to cast another plutonium although cast  it still needed to be pressed and coated  which would take until august therefore  it could have been ready for use on august 19.  unable to reach marshall  groves ordered on his own authority on august 13  that the core should not be august 9,  japan s war council still insisted on its four conditions for surrender  on that day hirohito ordered kōichi kido to  quickly control the situation     because the soviet union has declared war against us   he then held an imperial conference during which he authorized minister shigenori tōgō to notify the allies that japan would accept their terms on one condition  that the declaration  does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of his majesty as a sovereign august 12,  the emperor informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender  one of his uncles  prince asaka  then asked whether the war would be continued if the kokutai could not be preserved  hirohito simply replied   of as the allied terms seemed to leave intact the principle of the preservation of the throne  hirohito recorded on august 14  his capitulation announcement which was broadcast to the japanese nation the next day despite a short rebellion by militarists opposed to the his declaration  hirohito referred to the atomic bombings moreover  the enemy now possesses a new and terrible weapon with the power to destroy many innocent lives and do incalculable damage  should we continue to fight  not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the japanese nation  but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization such being the case  how are we to save the millions of our subjects  or to atone ourselves before the hallowed spirits of our imperial ancestors  this is the reason why we have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the joint declaration of the his  rescript to the soldiers and sailors  delivered on august 17,  he stressed the impact of the soviet invasion on his decision to hirohito met with general macarthur on september 27,  saying to him that peace party did not prevail until the bombing of hiroshima created a situation which could be dramatized   furthermore  the  rescript to the soldiers and sailors  speech he told macarthur about was just personal  not political  and never stated that the soviet intervention in manchuria was the main reason for surrender  in fact  a day after the bombing of nagasaki and the soviet invasion of manchuria  hirohito ordered his advisers  primarily chief cabinet secretary hisatsune sakomizu  kawada mizuho  and masahiro yasuoka  to write up a surrender speech  in hirohito s speech  days before announcing it on radio on august 15,  he gave three major reasons for surrender  tokyo s defenses would not be complete before the american invasion of japan  ise shrine would be lost to the americans  and atomic weapons deployed by the americans would lead to the death of the entire japanese race  despite the soviet intervention  hirohito did not mention the soviets as the main factor for the war  the british embassy in washington reported that americans regarded the japanese as  a nameless mass of caricatures depicting japanese as less than human  e g  monkeys  were a 1944  opinion poll that asked what should be done with japan found that 13%  of the u s  public were in favor of  killing off  all japanese the hiroshima bomb detonated successfully  oppenheimer addressed an assembly at los alamos  clasping his hands together like a prize-winning  the bombing amazed otto hahn and other german atomic scientists the british held at farm hall in operation epsilon  hahn stated that he had not believed an atomic weapon  would be possible for another twenty years   werner heisenberg did not believe the news at first  carl friedrich von weizsäcker said  i think it s dreadful of the americans to have done it  i think it is madness on their part   but heisenberg replied   one could equally well say  that s the quickest way of ending the war    hahn was grateful that the german project had not succeeded in developing  such an inhumane weapon   karl wirtz observed that even if it had   we would have obliterated london but would still not have conquered the world  and then they would have dropped them on told the others   once i wanted to suggest that all uranium should be sunk to the bottom

using st albans abbey for a thanksgiving service for the war s end  calling the use of atomic weapons  an act of wholesale  indiscriminate nonetheless  news of the atomic bombing was greeted enthusiastically in the u s   a poll in fortune magazine in late 1945  showed a significant minority of americans (22.7%)  wishing that more atomic bombs could have been dropped on the initial positive response was supported by the imagery presented to the public  mainly the powerful images of the mushroom cloud  and the censorship of photographs that showed corpses and maimed such  censorship  was however the status-quo  at the time  with no major news outlets depicting corpses or maimed survivors as a result from other events  us or august 10,  1945,  the day after the nagasaki bombing  yōsuke yamahata  correspondent higashi and artist yamada arrived in the city with orders to record the destruction for maximum propaganda purposes  yamahata took scores of photographs and on august 21  they appeared in mainichi shimbun  a popular japanese wilfred burchett was the first western journalist to visit hiroshima after the atom bomb was dropped  arriving alone by train from tokyo on september 2,  the day of the formal surrender aboard the uss missouri  his morse code dispatch was printed by the daily express newspaper in london on september 5,  1945,  entitled  the atomic plague   the first public report to mention the effects of radiation and nuclear burchett s reporting was unpopular with the u s  military  the u s  censors suppressed a supporting story submitted by george weller of the chicago daily news  and accused burchett of being under the sway of japanese propaganda  laurence dismissed the reports on radiation sickness as japanese efforts to undermine american morale  ignoring his own account of hiroshima s radiation sickness published one week member of the u s  strategic bombing survey  lieutenant daniel mcgovern  used a film crew to document the results in early the film crew s work resulted in a three-hour  documentary entitled the effects of the atomic bombs against hiroshima and nagasaki  the documentary included images from hospitals showing the human effects of the bomb  it showed burned out buildings and cars  and rows of skulls and bones on the ground  it was classified  secret  for the next 22  during this time in america  it was a common practice for editors to keep graphic images of death out of films  magazines  and the total of 90,000  ft (27,000  m  of film shot by mcgovern s cameramen had not been fully aired as of 2009.  according to greg mitchell  with the 2004  documentary film original child bomb  a small part of that footage managed to reach part of the american public  in the unflinching and powerful form its creators picture company nippon eigasha started sending cameramen to nagasaki and hiroshima in september 1945.  on october 24,  1945,  a u s  military policeman stopped a nippon eigasha cameraman from continuing to film in nagasaki  all nippon eigasha s reels were then confiscated by the american authorities  these reels were in turn requested by the japanese government  declassified  and saved from oblivion  some black-and-white  motion pictures were released and shown for the first time to japanese and american audiences in the years from 1968  to the public release of film footage of the city post-attack,  and some research about the human effects of the attack  was restricted during the occupation of japan  and much of this information was censored until the signing of the san francisco peace treaty in 1951,  restoring control to the the most politically charged and detailed weapons effects information was censored during this period  the hiroshima-based  magazine  chugoku bunka for example  in its first issue published march 10,  1946,  devotes itself to detailing the damage from the similarly  there was no censorship of the factually written witness accounts  the book hiroshima written by pulitzer prize winner john hersey  which was originally published in article form in the popular magazine the new on august 31,  1946,  is reported to have reached tokyo in english by january 1947,  and the translated version was released in japan in the book narrates the stories of the lives of six bomb survivors from immediately prior to  and months after  the dropping of the little boy beginning in 1974  a compilation of drawings and artwork made by the survivors of the bombings began to be compiled  with completion in 1977  and under both book and exhibition format  it was titled the unforgettable the spring of 1948,  the atomic bomb casualty commission  abcc  was established in accordance with a presidential directive from truman to the national academy of sciences – national research council to conduct investigations of the late effects of radiation among the survivors in hiroshima and one of the early studies conducted by the abcc was on the outcome of pregnancies occurring in hiroshima and nagasaki  and in a control city  kure  located 18  mi (29  km  south of hiroshima  in order to discern the conditions and outcomes related to radiation dr  james v  neel led the study which found that the number of birth defects was not significantly higher among the children of survivors who were pregnant at the time of the neel also studied the longevity of the children who survived the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki  reporting that between 90  and 95  percent were still living 50  years national academy of sciences questioned neel s procedure which did not filter the kure population for possible radiation overall  while a statistically insignificant increase in birth defects occurred directly after the bombings of nagasaki and hiroshima  neel and others noted that in approximately 50  humans who were of an early gestational age at the time of the bombing and who were all within about 1  km from the hypocenter  an increase in microencephaly and anencephaly was observed upon birth  with the incidence of these two particular malformations being nearly 3  times what was to be expected when compared to the control group in 1985,  johns hopkins university human geneticist james f  crow examined neel s research and confirmed that the number of birth defects was not significantly higher in hiroshima and many members of the abcc and its successor radiation effects research foundation  rerf  were still looking for possible birth defects or other causes among the survivors decades later  but found no evidence that they were more common among the despite the insignificance of birth defects found in neel s study and the detailed medical literature  up to 1987,  historians such as ronald e  powaski frequently wrote that hiroshima experienced  an increase in stillbirths  birth defects  and infant mortality  following the atomic cancers do not immediately emerge after exposure to radiation instead radiation-induced  cancer has a minimum latency period of some 5+  years  an epidemiology study by the rerf estimates that from 1950  to 2000,  46%  of leukemia deaths and 11%  of solid cancers of unspecificed lethality  could be due to radiation from the bombs  with the statistical excess being 200  leukemia deaths and 1,700  solid cancers of undeclared lethality  both of these statistics being derived from the observation of approximately half of the total survivors  strictly those who took part in the survivors of the bombings are called hibakusha  被爆者  japanese pronunciation  a japanese word that literally translates to "explosion-affected  people   the japanese government has recognized about 650,000  people as hibakusha  as of march 31,  164,621  are still alive  mostly in the government of japan recognizes about 1%  of these as having illnesses caused by the memorials in hiroshima and nagasaki contain lists of the names of the hibakusha who are known to have died since the bombings  updated annually on the anniversaries of the bombings  as of august the memorials record the names of almost 485,000  hibakusha  308,725  in and 175,743  in and their children were  and still are  victims of severe discrimination in japan due to public ignorance about the consequences of radiation sickness  with much of the public believing it to be hereditary or even this is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects or congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of hiroshima and a study of the long-term  psychological effects of the bombings on the survivors found that even 17–20  years after the bombings had occurred survivors showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and somatization march 24,  2009,  the japanese government officially recognized tsutomu yamaguchi as a double hibakusha  he was confirmed to be 3  km (1.9  mi  from ground zero in hiroshima on a business trip when little boy was detonated  he was seriously burnt on his left side and spent the night in hiroshima  he arrived at his home city of nagasaki on august 8,  the day before fat man was dropped  and he was exposed to residual radiation while searching for his relatives  he was the first officially recognized survivor of both he died on january 4,  2010,  at the age of 93,  after a battle with

war  japan brought as many as 670,000  korean conscripts to japan to work as forced about 5,000–8,000  koreans were killed in hiroshima and another 1,500–2,000  died in for many years  korean survivors had a difficult time fighting for the same recognition as hibakusha as afforded to all japanese survivors  a situation which resulted in the denial of the free health benefits to them  most issues were eventually addressed in 2008  through role of the bombings in japan s surrender and the u s  s ethical justification for them has been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades  j  samuel walker wrote in an april 2005  overview of recent historiography on the issue   the controversy over the use of the bomb seems certain to continue   he wrote that  the fundamental issue that has divided scholars over a period of nearly four decades is whether the use of the bomb was necessary to achieve victory in the war in the pacific on terms satisfactory to the united of the bombings generally assert that they caused the japanese surrender  preventing casualties on both sides during operation downfall  one figure of speech   one hundred million of the japanese empire  will die for the emperor and served as a unifying slogan  although that phrase was intended as a figure of speech along the lines of the  ten thousand years  in truman s 1955  memoirs   he states that the atomic bomb probably saved half a million u s  lives—anticipated casualties in an allied invasion of japan planned for november  stimson subsequently talked of saving one million u s  casualties  and churchill of saving one million american and half that number of british scholars have pointed out various alternatives that could have ended the war without an invasion  but these alternatives could have resulted in the deaths of many more supporters also point to an order given by the japanese war ministry on august 1,  1944,  ordering the execution of allied prisoners of war when the pow camp was in the combat who oppose the bombings cite a number of reasons for their view  among them  a belief that atomic bombing is fundamentally immoral  that the bombings counted as war crimes  that they were militarily unnecessary  that they constituted state and that they involved racism against and the dehumanization of the japanese the bombings were part of an already fierce conventional bombing campaign  this  together with the naval blockade  could also have eventually led to a japanese surrender  at the time the united states dropped its atomic bomb on nagasaki on august 9,  1945,  the soviet union launched a surprise attack with 1.6  million troops against the kwantung army in manchuria   the soviet entry into the war   argued japanese historian tsuyoshi hasegawa   played a much greater role than the atomic bombs in inducing japan to surrender because it dashed any hope that japan could terminate the war through moscow s popular view among critics of the bombings  originating with gar alperovitz in 1965  and becoming the default position in japanese school history textbooks  is the idea of atomic diplomacy  that the united states used nuclear weapons in order to intimidate the soviet union in the early stages of the cold
