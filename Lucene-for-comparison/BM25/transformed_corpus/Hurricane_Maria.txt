 hurricane maria -  wikipediahurricane maria is regarded as the worst natural disaster on record in dominica  and caused catastrophic damage and a major humanitarian crisis in puerto rico  the tenth-most  intense atlantic hurricane on record  maria was the thirteenth named storm  seventh consecutive hurricane  fourth major hurricane  and the second category 5  hurricane of the hyperactive 2017  atlantic hurricane season  at its peak  the hurricane caused catastrophic damage and numerous fatalities across the northeastern caribbean  compounding recovery efforts in the areas of the leeward islands already struck by hurricane irma just two weeks prior  maria was the third consecutive major hurricane to threaten the leeward islands in two weeks  after irma made landfall in several of the islands two weeks prior and hurricane jose passed dangerously close bringing tropical storm force winds to barbuda originating from a tropical wave  maria became a tropical storm on september 16,  east of the lesser antilles  highly favorable environmental conditions allowed the storm to undergo explosive intensification as it approached the island arc  the hurricane reached category 5  strength on september 18  upon making landfall on dominica  producing extreme winds across the entire island  afterwards  maria achieved its peak intensity over the eastern caribbean with maximum sustained winds of 175  mph (280  km h  and a pressure of 908  mbar  hpa  26.81  inhg   making it the tenth-most  intense atlantic hurricane on record  weakening slightly  but retaining its ferocious winds  maria struck puerto rico as a high-end  category 4  hurricane on september 20.  interaction with land weakened the hurricane  though it regained some strength as it moved northeast of the bahamas  moving slowly to the north  maria gradually degraded and weakened to a tropical storm on september 28.  embedded in the westerlies  maria accelerated toward the east and later east-northeast  over the open atlantic  becoming extratropical on september 30  and dissipating by october 3.as  of november 3,  at least 98  people are confirmed to have been killed by the hurricane  54  in puerto rico  28  in dominica  5  in the dominican republic  4  in the contiguous united states  3  in haiti  2  in guadeloupe  and 1  in the united states virgin islands  hundreds of others  mostly in dominica and puerto rico  are still missing  san juan mayor yulín cruz claimed that the actual death toll in puerto rico may actually be as high as maria wrought catastrophic damage to the entirety of dominica  which suffered an island-wide  communication blackout  much of the housing stock and infrastructure were left beyond repair  while the island s lush vegetation had been practically eradicated  the islands of guadeloupe and martinique endured widespread flooding  damaged roofs and uprooted trees  puerto rico suffered catastrophic damage  including destruction of its previously damaged electrical grid  for weeks in maria s wake  most of the island s population suffered from flooding and lack of resources  compounded by the slow relief process  total losses from the hurricane are estimated at between $15.9  and $95  billion (2017  usd   mostly in puerto rico  making maria s cost comparable to that of previous hurricanes irma and national hurricane center  nhc  began monitoring two tropical waves on september the easternmost wave quickly spun up into what would become hurricane lee  while the western one continued moving generally westward  with generally favorable conditions in the disturbance s path  development into a tropical cyclone seemed during those two days the disturbance became better and by september 16,  convective banding became established around a poorly organized circulation  as the system was an imminent threat to land despite the center not being well-defined,  the nhc initiated advisories on it as  potential tropical cyclone fifteen  at 15:00  utc  in accordance with a policy change enacted at the start of the a mid-level  ridge anchored north of the disturbance steered it generally west-northwest  into a region highly favorable for further development  sea surface temperatures of 84  °f (29  °c   low wind shear  and ample moisture were anticipated to foster strengthening to hurricane-status  before the system reached the lesser as the disturbance continued to grow increasingly well-defined  throughout the day  it was later upgraded to a moderate-range  tropical storm – based on satellite estimates – at 21:00  utc that day  receiving the name at that time  maria was situated 620  mi (1,000  km  east-southeast  of the lesser central dense overcast and favorable outflow developed atop the center of circulation  which enabled maria to become further organized throughout the early morning hours of september after a brief intrusion of dry air exposed the a convective burst occurred over the center and intensification resumed  hurricane hunters investigating the system observed surface winds of 74  mph (119  km h  and a formative eye feature  accordingly  the nhc upgraded maria to hurricane status at 21:00  expansion of the central dense overcast and an increasingly complete eyewall signaled steady intensification throughout the overnight of september considerable lightning activity was identified within the hurricane s core early on september 18  and statistical models indicated a high probability of rapid explosive strengthening took place shortly thereafter  with aircraft reconnaissance finding surface winds of 120  mph (195  km h  and a central pressure of 959  mbar  hpa  28.32  inhg   making maria a category 3  hurricane on the saffir–simpson scale  and hence a major hurricane  additionally  radar data revealed a well-defined  12  mi (19  km  wide the eye contracted slightly to 9  mi (14  km  as intensification continued  and the system reached category 4  strength by 21:00  intensification culminated late on september 18,  with maria achieving category 5  status just 15  mi (25  km  east-southeast  of hurricane hunters observed surface winds of 160  mph (260  km h  and a pressure of 925  mbar  hpa  27.32  inhg  at this maria made landfall in dominica at 01:15  utc on september becoming the first category 5  hurricane on record to strike the island interaction with the mountains of dominica imparted slight weakening of the hurricane to category 4;  however  once over the caribbean sea maria regained category 5  additional strengthening took place as the storm tracked northwest toward puerto rico  despite the formation of concentric eyewalls—the larger one spanning 25  to 35  mi (40  to 56  km  and the smaller only 5  mi (8.0  km   signalling the start of an eyewall replacement cycle—the inner violent core remained undisrupted through the maria attained its peak intensity around 04:00  utc on september 20,  roughly 30  mi (45  km  south of st  croix  sustained winds reached 175  mph (280  km h  and its central pressure bottomed out at 908  mbar  hpa  26.85  inhg   this ranks it as the tenth-most  intense atlantic hurricane since reliable records hurricane made its closest approach to st  croix around 05:00  utc on september 20,  passing within 20  mi (30  km  of the island  the storm s outer eyewall lashed the island while the more violent inner eye remained hours later  around 08:00  utc  the outer eyewall struck vieques  an island off the eastern coast of puerto by this time  the outer eye became dominant as the inner one decayed  and the eyewall replacement cycle caused maria to weaken to category 4  maria made landfall just south of yabucoa  puerto rico  around 10:15  utc with sustained winds of 155  mph (250  making it the strongest to hit the island since the 1928  san felipe segundo maria maintained a general west-northwest  course across puerto rico  emerging over the atlantic ocean shortly before 18:00  utc  interaction with the mountainous terrain resulted in substantial weakening  sustained winds fell to 110  mph (175  km h  and the central pressure rose to 957  mbars  hpa  28.26  with favorable environmental conditions  maria steadily reorganized as it moved away from puerto rico  a large eye  45  mi (75  km  wide  developed with deep convection blossoming around it  early on september 21,  the system regained category 3  cooler waters stirred up by hurricane irma two weeks prior limited maria s during the afternoon of september 21,  the system traversed the navidad and silver banks north of the dominican republic  shoaling from the region s shallow waters temporarily interfered with measurements of surface convection around the storm s eye deepened and its eye became better defined that night  and the hurricane reached a tertiary peak with sustained winds of 125  mph (205  an increase in southwesterly wind shear prompted gradual weakening of the hurricane  starting with restriction of banding features and later degradation of the late on september 22,  the hurricane turned north-northwest  as it reached the western periphery of the ridge previously steering it maria fluctuated in organization throughout september 23,  with its eye periodically clearing and becoming cloud-filled;  it maintained category 3  hurricane strength during this despite a decreasing central pressure  the storm finally weakened to category 2  strength early on september 24.  hurricane hunters observed flight-level  winds of 116  to 135  mph (187  to 217  km h   however  surface wind returns by the noaa s stepped-frequency  microwave radiometer were only 90  mph (150  km h   this indicated below-average  mixing down of winds by this time  maria s trajectory shifted almost due north between the aforementioned ridge and a cut-off  low over the eastern gulf of accelerated later on september 24  into september 25,  as the hurricane traversed a cold wake—with sea surface temperatures of 75–77  °f (24–25  °c —created by hurricane jose a week prior  maria degraded to category 1  strength during this early on september 25,  maria s structure changed dramatically as its inner-core  collapsed  the low-level  circulation became exposed to the northwest  and most of the deep convection shifted to the eastern half of the maria further weakened into a tropical storm during the late afternoon of september however  a sustained convective burst resulted in maria s winds increasing to hurricane-force  once again on september with banding features evident on the eastern part of the despite this  northwesterly wind shear continued to impinge on the storm  and maria once again weakened to a tropical storm early on september 28.  simultaneously  maria began to accelerate to the east-northeast  as it became embedded into the mid-latitude  gradually weakening  maria soon began to move over sea surface temperatures of 73  °f (23  °c  and below  causing most of its convection to dissipate  late on september 30,  maria transitioned into an extratropical during the next couple of days  maria s remnant accelerated towards the united kingdom  while rapidly maria s remnants later crossed the iberian peninsula into the western mediterranean sea on october 3,  before being absorbed by another frontal system later on the same the initiation of the national hurricane center  nhc  s first advisories for the system that would become tropical storm maria on the morning of september 16,  the government of france issued tropical storm watches for the islands of martinique and guadeloupe  while st  lucia issued a tropical storm watch for its citizens  and the government of barbados issued a similar watch for barbados would later that day declare a tropical storm watch for its citizens and saint vincent and the the government of antigua and barbuda issued hurricane watches for the islands of antigua  barbuda  st  kitts  nevis  and montserrat by the time of the nhc s second advisory which declared maria a tropical the dominican republic activated the international charter on space and major disasters for humanitarian satellite coverage on the recovering from hurricane irma two weeks prior  approximately 80,000  remained without power as maria puerto rico electric power authority  prepa  struggled with increasing debt  reaching $9  billion even before the hurricanes prompting them to file for bankruptcy  furthermore  the company lost 30  percent of its employees since 2012.  aging infrastructure across the island makes the grid more susceptible to damage from storms  the median age of prepa power plants is 44  years  inadequate safety also plagues the company and local newspapers frequently describe poor maintenance and outdated island s water system was also troubled before the hurricanes  seventy percent of the island had water that didn t meet the standards of the 1974  safe drinking water act  according to the natural resources defense orders were issued in puerto rico in advance of maria  and officials announced that 450  shelters would open in the afternoon of september as of september 19,  at least 2,000  people in puerto rico had sought maria approached the coast of north carolina and threatened to bring tropical storm conditions  a storm surge warning was issued for the coast between ocracoke inlet and cape hatteras  while a storm surge watch was issued for the pamlico sound  the lower neuse river  and the alligator river on the morning of september 26.  a state of emergency was declared by officials in dare and hyde counties  while visitors were ordered to evacuate hatteras and ocracoke ferry service between ocracoke and cedar island was suspended the evening of september 25,  and remained suspended on september 26  and 27,  due to rough seas  while ferry service between ocracoke and hatteras island was suspended on september 26  and the port in morehead city was closed by the united states coast guard on the morning of september schools in dare county closed on september 26  and 27,  while schools in carteret and tyrrell counties  along with ocracoke island  dismissed early on september 26,  in anticipation of high schools in currituck county were closed on september 27,  due to high outer rainbands of maria produced heavy rainfall and strong gusts across the southern windward the hewanorra and george f  l  charles airports of saint lucia respectively recorded 4.33  in (110  mm  and 3.1  in (80  mm  of rain  though even higher quantities fell elsewhere on the scattered rock

banana industry  suffered losses from the rainfall amounting to 3–5  in (75–125  caused scattered flooding across barbados  in christ church  the flood waters trapped residents from the neighborhood of goodland in their homes and inundated the business streets of saint lawrence maria stirred up rough seas that flooded coastal sidewalks in bridgetown and damaged boats as operators had difficulties securing their high winds triggered an island-wide  power outage and downed a coconut tree onto a residence in saint 30  mi (50  km  off the northern shorelines  maria brought torrential rainfall and strong gusts to martinique but spared the island of its hurricane-force  which at the time extended 25  mi (35  km  around the the commune of le marigot recorded 6.7  inches (170  mm  of rain over a 24-hour  by september 19,  maria had knocked out power to 70,000  households  about 40%  of the water service was cut to 50,000  customers  especially in the communes of le morne-rouge  and numerous roads and streets  especially along the northern coast  were impassible due to rock slides  fallen trees and toppled power streets in fort-de-france  were in the seaside commune of le carbet  rough seas washed ashore large rocks and demolished some coastal while some boats were blown over along the bay of the commune of martinique s agricultural sector suffered considerable losses  about 70%  of banana crops sustained wind damage  with nearly every tree downed along the northern there were no deaths on the island  although four people were injured in the hurricane—two seriously and two ahead of the hurricane caused several landslides in dominica as water levels across the island began to rise by the afternoon of september maria made landfall at 21:15  ast that day (1:15  utc  september 19)  as a category 5  hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 160  mph (260  these winds  the most extreme to ever impact the battered the roof of practically every home—including the official residence of prime minister roosevelt skerrit  who required rescue when his home began to downing all cellular  radio and internet services  maria effectively cut dominica off from the outside world  the situation there remained unclear for a couple of days after the hurricane s skerrit called the devastation  mind boggling  before going offline  and indicated immediate priority was to rescue survivors rather than assess initial ham radio reports from the capital of roseau on september 19  indicated  total devastation   with half the city flooded  cars stranded  and stretches of residential area next morning  the first aerial footage of dominica elucidated the scope of the maria left the mountainous country blanketed in a field of debris  rows of houses along the entirety of the coastline were rendered uninhabitable  as widespread floods and landslides littered neighborhoods with the structural the hurricane also inflicted extensive damage to roads and public buildings  such as schools  stores and and affected all of dominica s 73,000  residents in some form or the air control towers and terminal buildings of the canefield and douglas charles airports were severely damaged  although the runways remained relatively intact and open to emergency the disaster affected all of the island s 53  health facilities  including the badly damaged primary hospital  compromising the safety of many infrastructure of roseau was left in ruins  practically every power pole and line was downed  and the main road was reduced to fragments of flooded asphalt  the winds stripped the public library of its roof panels and demolished all but one wall of the baptist to the south of roseau  riverside flooding and numerous landslides impacted the town of pointe michel  destroying about 80%  of its structures and causing most of the deaths in the outside the capital area  the worst of the destruction was concentrated around the east coast and rural areas  where collapsed roads and bridges isolated many the port and fishing town of marigot  saint andrew parish  was 80%  settlements in saint david parish  such as castle bruce  good hope and grand fond  had been practically eradicated  many homes hung off cliffs or decoupled from their foundations  in rosalie  rushing waters gushed over the village s bridge and damaged facilities in its bay area  throughout saint patrick parish  the extreme winds ripped through roofs and scorched the vegetation  buildings in grand bay  the parish s main settlement  experienced total roof failure or were otherwise structurally compromised  many houses in la plaine caved in or slid into rivers  and its single bridge was the hurricane damaged the roofs of as much as 98%  of the island s including those serving as half of the houses had their frames its ferocious winds defoliated nearly all vegetation  splintering or uprooting thousands of trees and decimating the island s lush the agricultural sector  a vital source of income for the country  was completely wiped out  100%  of banana and tuber plantations was lost  as well as vast amounts of livestock and farm in maria s wake  dominica s

winds up north in nearby baillif reached 92  mph (148  along those regions  the hurricane kicked up extremely rough seas with 20  ft (6  m  the combination of rough seas and winds was responsible for widespread structural damage and flooding throughout the archipelago  especially from pointe-à-pitre,  along grand-terre  island s southwestern coast  to petit-bourg  and the southern coasts on basse-terre  aside from wind-related  effects  rainfall from maria was also significant  in just a day  the hurricane dropped nearly a month s worth of rainfall at some important locations

destroyed while the antenna of 30  feet in diameter was blown from the pedestal  the latter remaining intact  the radar is 2800  feet above sea level and the anemometer at the site measured winds of about 145  mph before communications broke  which means winds at that height were likely 20  percent higher than what was seen at sea level  its replacement will take a few nearby island of vieques

agriculture  a vital source of income for many  was obliterated as most trees were flattened  meanwhile  the driving force of the economy—tourism—was expected to be scarce in the months that followed maria  prime minister roosevelt skerrit characterized the devastation wrought by irma and maria as a sign of climate change and the threat it poses to the survival of his country  stating   to deny climate change     is to deny a truth we have just many islanders suffered respiratory problems as a result of excessive dust borne out of debris  light rainfall in the weeks following maria alleviated this problem  though it also slowed recovery efforts  particularly rebuilding damaged the caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility  dominica received approximately us$19.2  million in
