 federal aviation administration -  wikipediathe federal aviation administration  faa  of the united states is a national authority with powers to regulate all aspects of civil aviation  these include the construction and operation of airports  air traffic management  the certification of personnel and aircraft  and the protection of us assets during the launch or re-entry  of commercial space vehicles the faa s roles include the faa is divided into four  lines of business  each lob has a specific role within the faa the faa is headquartered in washington  as well as the william j  hughes technical center in atlantic city  new jersey  mike monroney aeronautical center in oklahoma city  oklahoma and its nine regional offices the air commerce act of may 20,  1926,  is the cornerstone of the federal government s regulation of civil aviation  this landmark legislation was passed at the urging of the aviation industry  whose leaders believed the airplane could not reach its full commercial potential without federal action to improve and maintain safety standards  the act charged the secretary of commerce with fostering air commerce  issuing and enforcing air traffic rules  licensing pilots  certifying aircraft  establishing airways  and operating and maintaining aids to air navigation  the newly created aeronautics branch  operating under the department of commerce assumed primary responsibility for aviation oversight in fulfilling its civil aviation responsibilities  the department of commerce initially concentrated on such functions as safety regulations and the certification of pilots and aircraft  it took over the building and operation of the nation s system of lighted airways  a task initiated by the post office department  the department of commerce improved aeronautical radio communications — before the founding of the federal communications commission in 1934,  which handles most such matters today — and introduced radio beacons as an effective aid to air navigation the aeronautics branch was renamed the bureau of air commerce in 1934  to reflect its enhanced status within the department  as commercial flying increased  the bureau encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control  atc  along the airways  in 1936,  the bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the atc system  the pioneer air traffic controllers used maps  blackboards  and mental calculations to ensure the safe separation of aircraft traveling along designated routes between cities in 1938,  the civil aeronautics act transferred the federal civil aviation responsibilities from the commerce department to a new independent agency  the civil aeronautics authority  the legislation also expanded the government s role by giving them the authority and the power to regulate airline fares and to determine the routes that air carriers would serve president franklin d  roosevelt split the authority into two agencies in 1940,  the civil aeronautics administration  caa  and the civil aeronautics board  cab   caa was responsible for atc  airman and aircraft certification  safety enforcement  and airway development  cab was entrusted with safety regulation  accident investigation  and economic regulation of the airlines  the caa was part of the department of commerce  the cab was an independent federal agency on the eve of america s entry into world war ii  caa began to extend its atc responsibilities to takeoff and landing operations at airports  this expanded role eventually became permanent after the war  the application of radar to atc helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation  in 1946,  meanwhile  congress gave caa the added task of administering the federal-aid  airport program  the first peacetime program of financial assistance aimed exclusively at development of the nation s civil airports the approaching era of jet travel  and a series of midair collisions  most notable was the 1956  grand canyon mid-air  collision   prompted passage of the federal aviation act of 1958.  this legislation gave the caa s functions to a new independent body  the federal aviation agency  the act transferred air safety regulation from the cab to the new faa  and also gave the faa sole responsibility for a common civil-military  system of air navigation and air traffic control  the faa s first administrator  elwood r  quesada  was a former air force general and adviser to president eisenhower the same year witnessed the birth of the national aeronautics and space administration  nasa   created in the wake of the soviets launching of the first artificial satellite and assuming naca s role of aeronautical research in 1967,  a new u s  department of transportation  dot  combined major federal responsibilities for air and surface transport  the federal aviation agency s name changed to the federal aviation administration as it became one of several agencies  e g   federal highway administration  federal railroad administration  the coast guard  and the saint lawrence seaway commission  within dot  albeit the largest   the faa administrator would no longer report directly to the president but would instead report to the secretary of transportation  new programs and budget requests would have to be approved by dot  which would then include these requests in the overall budget and submit it to the president at the same time  a new national transportation safety board took over the civil aeronautics board s  cab  role of investigating and determining the causes of transportation accidents and making recommendations to the secretary of transportation  cab was merged into dot with its responsibilities limited to the regulation of commercial airline routes and fares the faa gradually assumed additional functions  the hijacking epidemic of the 1960s  had already brought the agency into the field of civil aviation security  in response to the hijackings on september 11,  2001,  this responsibility is now primarily taken by the department of homeland security  the faa became more involved with the environmental aspects of aviation in 1968  when it received the power to set aircraft noise standards  legislation in 1970  gave the agency management of a new airport aid program and certain added responsibilities for airport safety  during the 1960s  and 1970s,  the faa also started to regulate high altitude  over 500  feet  kite and balloon flying by the mid-1970s,  the agency had achieved a semi-automated  air traffic control system using both radar and computer technology  this system required enhancement to keep pace with air traffic growth  however  especially after the airline deregulation act of 1978  phased out the cab s economic regulation of the airlines  a nationwide strike by the air traffic controllers union in 1981  forced temporary flight restrictions but failed to shut down the airspace system  during the following year  the agency unveiled a new plan for further automating its air traffic control facilities  but progress proved disappointing  in 1994,  the faa shifted to a more step-by-step  approach that has provided controllers with advanced 1979,  congress authorized the faa to work with major commercial airports to define noise pollution contours and investigate the feasibility of noise mitigation by residential retrofit programs  throughout the 1980s,  these charters were implemented in the 1990s,  satellite technology received increased emphasis in the faa s development programs as a means to improvements in communications  navigation  and airspace management  in 1995,  the agency assumed responsibility for safety oversight of commercial space transportation  a function begun eleven years before by an office within dot headquarters  the agency was responsible for the decision to ground flights after the september 11  attacks in 2007,  two faa whistleblowers  inspectors charalambe  bobby  boutris and douglas e  peters  alleged that boutris said he attempted to ground southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage of an aircraft  but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the this was validated by a report by the department of transportation which found faa managers had allowed southwest airlines to fly 46  airplanes in 2006  and 2007  that were overdue for safety inspections  ignoring concerns raised by inspectors  audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes  causing thousands of flight the house transportation and infrastructure committee held hearings in april 2008.  jim oberstar  former chairman of the committee said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses  allowing 117  aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with faa safety oberstar said there was a  culture of coziness  between senior faa officials and the airlines and  a systematic breakdown  in the faa s culture that resulted in  malfeasance  bordering on in 2008  the faa proposed to fine southwest $10.2  million for failing to inspect older planes for and in 2009  southwest and the faa agreed that southwest would pay a $7.5  million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures  with the fine doubling if southwest failed to follow december 2000,  an organization within the faa called the air traffic  ato  was set up by presidential executive order  this became the air navigation service provider for the airspace of the united states and for the new york  atlantic  and oakland  pacific  oceanic areas  it is a full member of the civil air navigation services organisation the faa issues a number of awards to holders of its licenses  among these are demonstrated proficiencies as an aviation mechanic  a flight instructor  a 50-year  aviator  or as a safe pilot  the latter  the faa  wings program   provides a series of three badges for pilots who have undergone several hours of training since their last award  for more information see  faa advisory circular 61-91h".on  march 18,  2008,  the faa ordered its inspectors to reconfirm that airlines are complying with federal rules after revelations that southwest airlines flew dozens of aircraft without certain mandatory the faa exercises surprise red team drills on national airports annually on october 31,  2013,  after outcry from media outlets  including heavy criticism from nick bilton of the new york the faa announced it will allow airlines to expand the passengers use of portable electronic devices during all phases of flight  but mobile phone calls will still be prohibited  implementation will vary among airlines  the faa expects many carriers to show that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode  gate-to-gate,  by the end of 2013.  devices must be held or put in the seat-back  pocket during the actual takeoff and landing  mobile phones must be in airplane mode or with mobile service disabled  with no signal bars displayed  and cannot be used for voice communications due to federal communications commission regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using mobile phones  if an air carrier provides wi-fi  service during flight  passengers may use it  short-range  bluetooth accessories  like wireless keyboards  can also be july 2014,  in the wake of the downing of malaysia airlines flight 17,  the faa suspended flights by u s  airlines to ben gurion airport during the 2014  israel–gaza conflict for 24  hours  the ban was extended for a further 24  hours  but was lifted about six hours law requires that the faa’s budget and mandate be reauthorized on a regular basis  on july 18,  2016,  president obama signed a second short-term  extension of the faa authorization  replacing a previous extension that was due to expire that 2016  extension  set to expire itself in september 2017)  left out a provision pushed by republican house leadership  including house transportation and infrastructure  t i  committee chairman bill shuster (r-pa).  the provision would have moved authority over air traffic control from the faa to a non-profit  corporation  as many other nations  such as canada  germany and the united kingdom have shuster s bill  the aviation innovation  reform  and reauthorization  airr  expired in the house at the end of the 114th  house t i committee began the new reauthorization process for the faa in february 2017.  it is expected that the committee will again urge congress to consider and adopt air traffic control reform as part of the reauthorization package  shuster has additional support from president trump  who  in a meeting with aviation industry executives in early 2017  said the u s  air control system is “… totally out of faa has been cited as an example of regulatory capture   in which the airline industry openly dictates to its regulators its governing rules  arranging for not only beneficial regulation  but placing key people to head these retired nasa office of inspector general senior special agent joseph gutheinz  who used to be a special agent with the office of inspector general for the department of transportation and with faa security  is one of the most outspoken critics of faa  rather than commend the agency for proposing a $10.2  million fine against southwest airlines for its failure to conduct mandatory inspections in 2008,  he was quoted as saying the following in an associated press story   penalties against airlines that violate faa directives should be stiffer  at $25,000  per violation  gutheinz said  airlines can justify rolling the dice and taking the chance on getting caught  he also said the faa is often too quick to bend to pressure from airlines and other experts have been critical of the constraints and expectations under which the faa is expected to operate  the dual role of encouraging aerospace travel and regulating aerospace travel are contradictory  for example  to levy a heavy penalty upon an airline for violating an faa regulation which would impact their ability to continue operating would not be considered encouraging aerospace travel on july 22,  2008,  in the aftermath of the southwest airlines inspection scandal  a bill was unanimously approved in the house to tighten regulations concerning airplane maintenance procedures  including the establishment of a whistleblower office and a two-year   cooling off  period that faa inspectors or supervisors of inspectors must wait before they can work for those they the bill also required rotation of principal maintenance inspectors and stipulated that the word  customer  properly applies to the flying public  not those entities regulated by the the bill died in a senate committee that september 2009,  the faa administrator issued a directive mandating that the agency use the term  customers  only to refer to the flying 2014,  the faa modified their approach to air traffic control hiring  they launched more  off the street bids   allowing anyone with either a 4-year  degree or 5  years of full-time  work experience to apply  rather than the closed college program or vra bids  something that had last been done in 2008.  thousands have been picked up  including veterans  cti grads  and people who are true  off the street  hires  the move was made to open the job up to more people who might make good controllers but did not go to a college that offered a cti program  before the change  candidates who had completed coursework at participating colleges and universities could be "fast-tracked"  for consideration  however  the cti program had no guarantee of a job offer  nor was the goal of the program to teach people to work actual traffic  the goal of the program was to prepare people for the faa academy in oklahoma city  ok  having a cti certificate allowed a prospective controller to skip the air traffic basics part of the academy  about a 30-  to 45-day  course  and go right into initial qualification training  iqt   all prospective controllers  cti or not  have had to pass the faa academy in order to be hired as a controller  failure at the academy means faa employment is terminated  in january 2015  they launched another pipeline  a  prior experience  bid  where anyone with an faa control tower operator certificate  cto  and 52  weeks of experience could apply  this was a revolving bid  every month the applicants on this bid were sorted out  and eligible applicants were hired and sent directly to facilities  bypassing the faa academy entirely in the process of promoting diversity the faa revised their hiring the faa later issued a report that the "bio-data"  was not a reliable test for future performance  however  the "bio-q"  was not the determinating factor for hiring  it was merely a screening tool to determine who would take a revised air traffic standardized aptitude test  atsat   due to cost and time  it was not practical to give all 30,000  some applicants the revised atsat  which has since been validated  there were also charges that the faa discriminated against qualified candidates and was helping minority candidates  cheat  to ensure they passed the december 2015,  a reverse discrimination lawsuit was filed against the faa seeking class action status for the thousands of men and women who spent up to $40,000  getting trained under faa rules before they were abruptly changed  the prospects of the lawsuit are unknown  as the faa is self-governing  entity and therefore can alter and experiment with its hiring practices  and there was never any guarantee of a job in the cti designated engineering representative  der  is an engineer who is appointed to act on behalf of a company or as an independent consultant dar is an
