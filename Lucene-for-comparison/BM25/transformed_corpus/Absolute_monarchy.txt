 absolute monarchy -  wikipediaabsolute monarchy  or despotic is a form of monarchy in which one ruler has supreme authority and where that authority is not restricted by any written laws  legislature  or these are often  but not always  hereditary monarchies  in contrast  in constitutional monarchies  the head of state s authority derives from and is legally bounded or restricted by a constitution or monarchies have weak or symbolic legislatures and other governmental bodies the monarch can alter or dissolve at will  countries where monarchs still maintain absolute power are  saudi vatican and the individual emirates composing the united arab emirates  which itself is a free association of such monarchies – a federal ancient egypt  the pharaoh wielded absolute power over the country and was considered a living god by his people  in ancient mesopotamia  many rulers of assyria  babylonia and sumer were absolute monarchs as well  in ancient and medieval india  rulers of the maurya  satahavana  gupta and chalukya empires  as well as other major and minor empires  were considered absolute monarchs  in the khmer empire  the kings were called  devaraja  and  chakravartin   king of the world   and exercised absolute power over the empire and people throughout chinese history  many emperors and one empress wielded absolute power through the mandate of heaven  in pre-columbian  america  the inca empire was ruled by a sapa inca  who was considered the son of inti  the sun god and absolute ruler over the people and nation  korea under the joseon dynasty was also an absolute much of european history  the divine right of kings was the theological justification for absolute monarchy  many european monarchs  such as those of russia  claimed supreme autocratic power by divine right  and that their subjects had no rights to limit their power  james vi of scotland  later also james i of england  and his son charles i of scotland and england tried to import this principle  charles i s attempt to enforce episcopal polity on the church of scotland led to rebellion by the covenanters and the bishops  wars  then fears that charles i was attempting to establish absolutist government along european lines was a major cause of the english civil war  despite the fact that he did rule this way for 11  years starting in 1629,  after dissolving the parliament of england for a time  by the 19th  century  the divine right was regarded as an obsolete theory in most countries in the western world  except in russia where it was still given credence as the official justification for the tsar s power until revolution in 1917.there  is a considerable variety of opinion by historians on the extent of absolutism among european monarchs  some  such as perry anderson  argue that quite a few monarchs achieved levels of absolutist control over their states  while historians such as roger mettam dispute the very concept of in general  historians who disagree with the appellation of absolutism argue that most monarchs labeled as absolutist exerted no greater power over their subjects than any other non-absolutist  rulers  and these historians tend to emphasize the differences between the absolutist rhetoric of monarchs and the realities of the effective use of power by these absolute monarchs  renaissance historian william bouwsma summed up this contradiction nothing so clearly indicates the limits of royal power as the fact that governments were perennially in financial trouble  unable to tap the wealth of those most able to pay  and likely to stir up a costly revolt whenever they attempted to develop an adequate widely held story about louis xiv of france (1638–1715)  is that he proclaimed  l état  c est moi    i am the state     what louis did say was   the interests of the state come first  when one gives these priority  one labors for one s own good  these advantages to the state redounds to one s glory   although often criticized for his extravagances  such as the palace of versailles  he reigned over france for a long period  and some historians consider him a successful absolute monarch  more recently  revisionist historians have questioned whether louis  reign should be considered  absolute   given the reality of the balance of power between the monarch and the king of france concentrated in his person legislative  executive  and judicial powers  he was the supreme judicial authority  he could condemn men to death without the right of appeal  it was both his duty to punish offenses and stop them from being committed  from his judicial authority followed his power both to make laws and to annul of his steps in creating an absolute monarchy in france was to build the palace of versailles  where he lived with many of his nobles and other important people  in order to control and watch over was underpinned by a written constitution for the first time in europe in the 1665  kongeloven   king s law   of denmark-norway,  which ordered that the monarch  shall from this day forth be revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the earth by all his subjects  standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person  neither in spiritual nor temporal matters  except god this law consequently authorized the king to abolish all other centers of power  most important was the abolition of the council of the realm in brandenburg-prussia,  the concept of absolute monarch took a notable turn from the above with its emphasis on the monarch as the  first servant of the state   but it also echoed many of the important characteristics of absolutism  frederick william  r  1640–1688),  known as the great elector  used the uncertainties of the final stages of the thirty years  needed  to consolidate his territories into the dominant kingdom in northern germany  whilst increasing his power over his subjects  his actions largely originated the militaristic streak of the hohenzollern in 1653  the diet of brandenburg met for the last time and gave frederick william the power to raise taxes without its consent  a strong indicator of absolutism  frederick william enjoyed support from the nobles  who enabled the great elector to undermine the diet and other representative assemblies  the leading families saw their future in cooperation with the central government and worked to establish absolutist power the most significant indicator of the nobles  success was the establishment of two tax rates – one for the cities and the other for the countryside – to the great advantage of the latter  which the nobles ruled  the nobles served in the upper levels of the elector s army and bureaucracy  but they also won new prosperity for themselves  the support of the elector enabled the imposition of serfdom and the consolidation of land holdings into vast estates which provided for their wealth they became known as junkers  from the german for young lord  junger herr   frederick william faced resistance from representative assemblies and long-independent  cities in his realm  city leaders often revolted at the imposition of electorate authority  the last notable effort was the uprising of the city of königsberg which allied with the estates general of prussia to refuse to pay taxes  frederick william crushed this revolt in 1662,  by marching into the city with thousands of troops  a similar approach was used with the towns of 1905  the tsars of russia governed as absolute monarchs  peter i the great reduced the power of the russian nobility and strengthened the central power of the tsars  establishing a bureaucracy and a police state  this tradition of absolutism  known as tsarist autocracy  was expanded by catherine ii the great and her descendants  although alexander ii made some reforms and established an independent judicial system  russia did not have a representative assembly or a constitution until the 1905  revolution  however  the concept of absolutism was so ingrained in russia that the russian constitution of 1906  still described the tsar as an autocrat  russia became the last european country  excluding vatican city  to abolish absolutism  and it was the only one to do so as late as the 20th  century  the ottoman empire drafted its first constitution in 1877).the  form of government instituted in sweden under king charles xi and passed on to his son  charles xii is commonly referred to as absolute monarchy  however  the swedish monarch was never absolute in the sense that he wielded arbitrary power  the monarch still ruled under the law and could only legislate in agreement with the riksdag of the estates  rather  the absolutism introduced was the monarch s ability to run the government unfettered by the privy council  contrary to earlier practice  the absolute rule of charles xi was instituted by the crown and the riksdag in order to carry out the great reduction which would have been made impossible by the privy council which comprised the high nobility  after the death of charles xii in 1718,  the system of absolute rule was largely blamed for the ruination of the realm in the great northern war  and the reaction tipped the balance of power to the other extreme end of the spectrum  ushering in the age of liberty  after half a century of largely unrestricted parliamentary rule proved just as ruinous  king gustav iii seized back royal power in the coup d état of 1772,  and later once again abolished the privy council under the union and security act in 1789,  which  in turn  was rendered void in 1809  when gustav iv adolf was deposed in a coup and the constitution of 1809  was put in its place  the years between 1789  and 1809,  then  are also referred to as a period of absolute monarchy the popularity of the notion of absolute monarchy declined substantially after the american revolution and the french revolution  which promoted theories of government based on popular sovereignty many nations formerly with absolute monarchies  such as jordan  kuwait and morocco  have moved towards constitutional monarchy  although in some cases the monarch retains tremendous power  to the point that the parliament s influence on political life is negligible in bhutan  the government moved from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy following planned parliamentary elections to the tshogdu in 2003,  and the election of a national assembly in 2008.  nepal had several swings between constitutional rule and direct rule related to the nepalese civil war  the maoist insurgency  and the 2001  nepalese royal massacre  with the nepalese monarchy being abolished on may 28,  2008.  in tonga  the king had majority control of the legislative assembly until 2010.on  the other hand  liechtenstein has moved towards expanding the power of the monarch  the prince of liechtenstein was given expanded powers after a referendum amending the constitution of liechtenstein in 2003,  which led the bbc to describe the prince as an  absolute monarch ruling kim family of north korea  kim il-sung,  kim jong-il  and kim jong-un)  has been described as a de facto absolute or  hereditary in 2013,  clause 2  of article 10  of the new edited ten fundamental principles of the korean workers  party states that the party and revolution must be carried  eternally  by the  baekdu  kim s  qatar should be regarded as a constitutional is disputed saudi arabia is an absolute although  according to the basic law of saudi arabia adopted by royal decree in 1992,  the king must comply with shari a  islamic law  and the qur an  the qur an and the corpus of sunnah  traditions of the prophet muhammad  are declared to be the kingdom s constitution  but no written modern constitution has ever been written for saudi arabia  which remains one of two arab nations where no national elections have ever taken place since its the other being qatar  no political parties or national elections are and according to the economist s 2010  democracy index  the saudi government is the seventh most authoritarian regime from among the 167  countries sociology  and ethology as well as various other disciplines such as political science attempt to explain the rise of absolute monarchy ranging from extrapolation generally  to certain marxist explanations in terms of the class struggle as the underlying dynamic of human historical development generally and absolute monarchy in particular in the 17th  century  french legal theorist jean domat defended the concept of absolute monarchy in works such as  on social order and absolute monarchy   citing absolute monarchy as preserving natural order as god to norbert elias s the civilizing process (1939),  monarchs such as louis xiv could enjoy such great power because of the structure of the societies at that time  more precisely  they could play off against each other two rival classes  namely the rising bourgeoisie  who grew wealthy from commerce and industrial production  and the nobility  who lived off the land and administrative functions
