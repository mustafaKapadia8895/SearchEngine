 evaporative cooler -  wikipediaan evaporative cooler  also swamp cooler  desert cooler and wet air cooler  is a device that cools air through the evaporation of water  evaporative cooling differs from typical air conditioning systems  which use vapor-compression  or absorption refrigeration cycles  evaporative cooling works by exploiting water s large enthalpy of vaporization  the temperature of dry air can be dropped significantly through the phase transition of liquid water to water vapor  evaporation   this can cool air using much less energy than refrigeration  in extremely dry climates  evaporative cooling of air has the added benefit of conditioning the air with more moisture for the comfort of building occupants the cooling potential for evaporative cooling is dependent on the wet bulb depression  the difference between dry-bulb  temperature and wet-bulb  temperature  in arid climates  evaporative cooling can reduce energy consumption and total equipment for conditioning as an alternative to compressor-based  cooling  in climates not considered arid  indirect evaporative cooling can still take advantage of the evaporative cooling process without increasing humidity  passive evaporative cooling strategies offer the same benefits of mechanical evaporative cooling systems without the complexity of equipment and ductwork an earlier form of evaporative cooling  the windcatcher  was used in ancient egypt and persia thousands of years ago in the form of wind shafts on the roof  they caught the wind  passed it over subterranean water in a qanat and discharged the cooled air into the building  modern iranians have widely adopted powered evaporative coolers  coolere evaporative cooler was the subject of numerous us patents in the 20th  century  many of these  starting in suggested or assumed the use of excelsior  wood wool  pads as the elements to bring a large volume of water in contact with moving air to allow evaporation to occur  a typical design  as shown in a 1945  patent  includes a water reservoir  usually with level controlled by a float valve   a pump to circulate water over the excelsior pads and a centrifugal fan to draw air through the pads and into the this design and this material remain dominant in evaporative coolers in the american southwest  where they are also used to increase in the united states  the use of the term swamp cooler may be due to the odor of algae produced by early mounted evaporative cooling devices  car coolers  were used in some automobiles to cool interior air—often as aftermarket modern vapor-compression  air conditioning became widely available passive evaporative cooling techniques in buildings  such as evaporative cooling towers  have only been developed and studied in the last 30  years  in 1974,  william h  goettl invented the  combination refrigeration and evaporative cooling air conditioner  in arizona after noticing that evaporative cooling technology works better in arid climates rather than humidity but that a combination unit would be more effective  in 1986,  two researchers at the university of arizona  tucson  w  cunningham and t  thompson  constructed the first passive evaporative cooling tower in tucson  az  this performance data from this experimental facility became the foundation of today’s evaporative cooling tower design guidelines  developed by baruch coolers lower the temperature of air using the principle of evaporative cooling  unlike typical air conditioning systems which use vapor-compression  refrigeration or absorption refrigerator  evaporative cooling is the conversion of liquid water into vapor using the thermal energy in the air  resulting in a lower air temperature  the energy needed to evaporate the water is taken from the air in the form of sensible heat  which affects the temperature of the air  and converted into latent heat  the energy present in the water vapor component of the air  whilst the air remains at a constant enthalpy value  this conversion of sensible heat to latent heat is known as an isenthalpic process because it occurs at a constant enthalpy value  evaporative cooling therefore causes a drop in the temperature of air proportional to the sensible heat drop and an increase in humidity proportional to the latent heat gain  evaporative cooling can be visualized using a psychrometric chart by finding the initial air condition and moving along a line of constant enthalpy toward a state of higher simple example of natural evaporative cooling is perspiration  or sweat  secreted by the body  evaporation of which cools the body  the amount of heat transfer depends on the evaporation rate  however for each kilogram of water vaporized 2,257  kj of energy  about 890  btu per pound of pure water  at 95  °f (35  °c   are transferred  the evaporation rate depends on the temperature and humidity of the air  which is why sweat accumulates more on humid days  as it does not evaporate fast enough.vapor-compression  refrigeration uses evaporative cooling  but the evaporated vapor is within a sealed system  and is then compressed ready to evaporate again  using energy to do so  a simple evaporative cooler s water is evaporated into the environment  and not recovered  in an interior space cooling unit  the evaporated water is introduced into the space along with the now-cooled  air  in an evaporative tower the evaporated water is carried off in the airflow exhaust a closely related process  sublimation cooling differs from evaporative cooling in that a phase transition from solid to vapor  rather than liquid to vapor  occurs sublimation cooling has been observed to operate on a planetary scale on the planetoid pluto  where it has been called an anti-greenhouse  effect another application of a phase change to cooling is the "self-refrigerating"  beverage can  a separate compartment inside the can contains a desiccant and a liquid  just before drinking  a tab is pulled so that the desiccant comes into contact with the liquid and dissolves  as it does so it absorbs an amount of heat energy called the latent heat of fusion  evaporative cooling works with the phase change of liquid into vapor and the latent heat of vaporization  but the self-cooling  can uses a change from solid to liquid  and the latent heat of fusion to achieve the same result before the advent of refrigeration  evaporative cooling was used for millennia  a porous earthenware vessel would cool water by evaporation through its walls  frescoes from about 2500  bc show slaves fanning jars of water to cool a vessel could also be placed in a bowl of water  covered with a wet cloth dipping into the water  to keep milk or butter as fresh as cooling is a common form of cooling buildings for thermal comfort since it is relatively cheap and requires less energy than other forms of cooling the figure showing the salt lake city weather data represents the typical summer climate  june to september   the colored lines illustrate the potential of direct and indirect evaporative cooling strategies to expand the comfort range in summer time  it is mainly explained by the combination of a higher air speed on one hand and elevated indoor humidity when the region permits the direct evaporative cooling strategy on the other hand  evaporative cooling strategies that involve the humidification of the air should be implemented in dry condition where the increase in moisture content stays below recommendations for occupant’s comfort and indoor air quality  passive cooling towers lack the control that traditional hvac systems offer to occupants  however  the additional air movement provided into the space can improve occupant comfort evaporative cooling is most effective when the relative humidity is on the low side  limiting its popularity to dry climates  evaporative cooling raises the internal humidity level significantly  which desert inhabitants may appreciate as the moist air re-hydrates  dry skin and sinuses  therefore  assessing typical climate data is an essential procedure to determine the potential of evaporative cooling strategies for a building  the three most important climate considerations are dry-bulb  temperature  wet-bulb  temperature  and wet-bulb  depression during the summer design day  it is important to determine if the wet-bulb  depression can provide sufficient cooling during the summer design day  by subtracting the wet-bulb  depression from the outside dry-bulb  temperature  one can estimate the approximate air temperature leaving the evaporative cooler  it is important to consider that the ability for the exterior dry-bulb  temperature to reach the wet-bulb  temperature depends on the saturation efficiency  a general recommendation for applying direct evaporative cooling is to implement it in places where the wet-bulb  temperature of the outdoor air does not exceed 22  °c (71.6  however  in the example of salt lake city  the upper limit for the direct evaporative cooling on psychrometric chart is 20  °c (68  °f   despite this lower value  this climate is still suitable for this technique evaporative cooling is especially well suited for climates where the air is hot and humidity is low  in the united states  the western mountain states are good locations  with evaporative coolers prevalent in cities like denver  salt lake city  albuquerque  el paso  tucson  and fresno  evaporative air conditioning is also popular and well-suited  to the southern  temperate  part of australia  in dry  arid climates  the installation and operating cost of an evaporative cooler can be much lower than that of refrigerative air conditioning  often by 80%  or so  however  evaporative cooling and vapor-compression  air conditioning are sometimes used in combination to yield optimal cooling results  some evaporative coolers may also serve as humidifiers in the heating season  even in regions that are mostly arid  short periods of high humidity may prevent evaporative cooling from being an effective cooling strategy  an example of this event is the monsoon season in new mexico and southern arizona in july and august in locations with moderate humidity there are many cost-effective  uses for evaporative cooling  in addition to their widespread use in dry climates  for example  industrial plants  commercial kitchens  laundries  dry cleaners  greenhouses  spot cooling  loading docks  warehouses  factories  construction sites  athletic events  workshops  garages  and kennels  and confinement farming  poultry ranches  hog  and dairy  often employ evaporative cooling  in highly humid climates  evaporative cooling may have little thermal comfort benefit beyond the increased ventilation and air movement it provides trees transpire large amounts of water through pores in their leaves called stomata  and through this process of evaporative cooling  forests interact with climate at local and global cooling is commonly used in cryogenic applications  the vapor above a reservoir of cryogenic liquid is pumped away  and the liquid continuously evaporates as long as the liquid s vapor pressure is significant  evaporative cooling of ordinary helium forms a 1-k  pot  which can cool to at least 1.2  k  evaporative cooling of helium-3  can provide temperatures below 300  mk  these techniques can be used to make cryocoolers  or as components of lower-temperature  cryostats such as dilution refrigerators  as the temperature decreases  the vapor pressure of the liquid also falls  and cooling becomes less effective  this sets a lower limit to the temperature attainable with a given liquid evaporative cooling is also the last cooling step in order to reach the ultra-low  temperatures required for bose–einstein condensation  bec   here  so-called  forced evaporative cooling is used to selectively remove high-energetic    hot   atoms from an atom cloud until the remaining cloud is cooled below the bec transition temperature  for a cloud of 1  million alkali atoms  this temperature is about 1μk.although  robotic spacecraft use thermal radiation almost exclusively  many manned spacecraft have short missions that permit open-cycle  evaporative cooling  examples include the space shuttle  the apollo command service module  csm   lunar module and portable life support system  the apollo csm and the space shuttle also had radiators  and the shuttle could evaporate ammonia as well as water  the apollo spacecraft used sublimators  compact and largely passive devices that dump waste heat in water vapor  steam  that is vented to needed  when liquid water is exposed to vacuum it boils vigorously  carrying away enough heat to freeze the remainder to ice that covers the sublimator and automatically regulates the feedwater flow depending on the heat load  the water expended is often available in surplus from the fuel cells used by many manned spacecraft to produce electricity however the ice crystals from dumped urine  water etc   which are flying through space at orbital velocities  have been found to  sand blast  space craft most designs take advantage of the fact that water has one of the highest known enthalpy of vaporization  latent heat of vaporization  values of any common substance  because of this  evaporative coolers use only a fraction of the energy of vapor-compression  or absorption air conditioning systems  unfortunately  except in very dry climates  the single-stage   direct  cooler can increase relative humidity  rh  to a level that makes occupants uncomfortable  indirect and two-stage  evaporative coolers keep the rh lower direct evaporative cooling  open circuit  is used to lower the temperature and increase the humidity of air by using latent heat of evaporation  changing liquid water to water vapor  in this process  the energy in the air does not change  warm dry air is changed to cool moist air  the heat of the outside air is used to evaporate water  the rh increases to 70  to 90%  which reduces the cooling effect of human perspiration  the moist air has to be continually released to outside or else the air becomes saturated and evaporation stops  a mechanical direct evaporative cooler unit uses a fan to draw air through a wetted membrane  or pad  which provides a large surface area for the evaporation of water into the air  water is sprayed at the top of the pad so it can drip down into the membrane and continually keep the membrane saturated  any excess water that drips out from the bottom of the membrane is collected in a pan and recirculated to the top  single stage direct evaporative coolers are typically small in size as it only consists of the membrane  water pump  and centrifugal fan  the mineral content of the municipal water supply will cause scaling on the membrane  which will lead to clogging over the life of the membrane  depending on this mineral content and the evaporation rate  regular cleaning and maintenance is required to ensure optimal performance  generally  supply air from the single-stage  evaporative cooler will need to be exhausted directly (one-through  flow  because the high humidity of the supply air  few design solutions have been conceived to utilize the energy in the air like directing the exhaust air through two sheets of double glazed windows  thus reducing the solar energy absorbed through the compared to energy required to achieve the equivalent cooling load with a compressor  single stage evaporative coolers consume less passive direct evaporative cooling can occur anywhere that the evaporatively cooled water can cool a space without the assist of a fan  this can be achieved through use of fountains or more architectural designs such as the evaporative downdraft cooling tower  also called a “passive cooling tower”  the passive cooling tower design allows outside air to flow in through the top of a tower that is constructed within or next to the building  the outside air comes in contact with water inside the tower either through a wetted membrane or a mister  as water evaporates in the outside air  the air becomes cooler and less buoyant and creates a downward flow in the tower  at the bottom of the tower  an outlet allows the cooler air into the interior  similar to mechanical evaporative coolers  towers can be an attractive low-energy  solution for hot and dry climate as they only require a water pump to raise water to the top of the energy savings from using a passive direct evaporating cooling strategy depends on the climate and heat load  for arid climates with a great wet bulb depression  cooling towers can provide enough cooling during summer design conditions to be net zero  for example  a 371  m² (4,000  ft²  retail store in tucson  arizona with a sensible heat gain of 29.3  kj h (100,000  btu h  can be cooled entirely by two passive cooling towers providing 11890  m³ h (7,000  cfm  the zion national park visitor’s center  which uses two passive cooling towers  the cooling energy intensity was 14.5  mj m² (1.28  kbtu ft    which was 77%  less than a typical building in the western united states that uses 62.5  mj m² (5.5  a study of field performance results in kuwait revealed that power requirements for an evaporative cooler are approximately 75%  less than the power requirements for a conventional packaged unit evaporative cooling  closed circuit  is a cooling process that uses direct evaporative cooling in addition to some type of heat exchanger to transfer the cool energy to the supply air  the cooled moist air from the direct evaporative cooling process never comes in direct contact with the conditioned supply air  the moist air stream is released outside or used to cool other external devices such as solar cells which are more efficient if kept cool  one indirect cooler manufacturer uses the so-called  maisotsenko cycle which employs an iterative (multi-step)  heat exchanger that can reduce the temperature to below the wet-bulb  while no moisture is added to the incoming air the relative humidity  rh  does rise a little according to the temperature-rh  formula  still  the relatively dry air resulting from indirect evaporative cooling allows inhabitants  perspiration to evaporate more easily  increasing the relative effectiveness of this technique  indirect cooling is an effective strategy for hot-humid  climates that cannot afford to increase the moisture content of the supply air due to indoor air quality and human thermal comfort concerns  the following graphs describe the process of direct and indirect evaporative cooling with the changes in temperature  moisture content and relative humidity of the air passive indirect evaporative cooling strategies are rare because this strategy involves an architectural element to act as a heat exchanger  for example a roof   this element can be sprayed with water and cooled through the evaporation of the water on this element  these strategies are rare due to the high use of water  which also introduces the risk of water intrusion and compromising building structure in the first stage of a two-stage  cooler  warm air is pre-cooled  indirectly without adding humidity  by passing inside a heat exchanger that is cooled by evaporation on the outside   in the direct stage  the pre-cooled  air passes through a water-soaked  pad and picks up humidity as it cools  since the air supply is pre-cooled  in the first stage  less humidity is transferred in the direct stage  to reach the desired cooling temperatures  the result  according to manufacturers  is cooler air with a rh between 50-70%,  depending on the climate  compared to a traditional system that produces about 70–80%  relative humidity in the conditioned needed in a hybrid design  direct or indirect cooling has been combined with vapor-compression  or absorption air conditioning to increase the overall efficiency and or to reduce the temperature below the wet-bulb  limit traditionally  evaporative cooler pads consist of excelsior  aspen wood fiber  inside a containment net  but more modern materials  such as some plastics and melamine paper  are entering use as cooler-pad  media  modern rigid media  commonly 8"  or 12"  thick  adds more moisture  and thus cools air more than typically much thinner aspen another material which is sometimes used is corrugated arid and semi-arid  climates  the scarcity of water makes water consumption a concern in cooling system design  from the installed water research   420938  l (111,200  gal  of water were consumed during 2002  for the two passive cooling towers at zion national park visitor needed  however  such concerns are addressed by experts who note that electricity generation usually requires a lot of water  and evaporative coolers use far less electricity  and thus comparable water overall  and cost less overall  compared to direct solar exposure to the media pads increases the evaporation rate  sunlight may  however  degrade some media  in addition to heating up other elements of the evaporative cooling design  therefore  shading is advisable in most applications apart from fans used in mechanical evaporative cooling  pumps are the only other piece of mechanical equipment required for the evaporative cooling process in both mechanical and passive applications  pumps can be used for either recirculating the water to the wet media pad or providing water at very high pressure to a mister system for a passive cooling tower  pump specifications will vary depending on evaporation rates and media pad area  the zion national park visitor’s center uses a 250  w (1/3  hp  ducts and or open windows must be used at all times to allow air to continually escape the air conditioned area  otherwise  pressure develops and the fan blower in the system is unable to push much air through the media and into the air conditioned area  the evaporative system cannot function without exhausting the continuous supply of air from the air conditioned area to the outside  by optimizing the placement of the  cooled air  inlet  along with the layout of the house passages  related doors and room windows  the system can be used most effectively to direct the cooled air to the required areas  a well designed layout can very effectively scavenge and expel the hot air from desired areas without the need for an above ceiling ducted venting system  continuous airflow is essential  so the exhaust windows or vents must not restrict the volume and passage of air being introduced by the evaporative cooling machine  one must also be mindful of the outside wind direction  as for example a strong hot southerly wind will slow or restrict the exhausted air from a south facing window  it is always best to have the downwind windows open  while the upwind windows are closed typically  residential and industrial evaporative coolers use direct evaporation  and can be described as an enclosed metal or plastic box with vented sides  air is moved by a centrifugal fan or blower   usually driven by an electric motor with pulleys known as  sheaves  in hvac terminology  or a direct-driven  axial fan   and a water pump is used to wet the evaporative cooling pads  the cooling units can be mounted on the roof  down draft  or downflow   or exterior walls or windows  side draft  or horizontal flow  of buildings  to cool  the fan draws ambient air through vents on the unit s sides and through the damp pads  heat in the air evaporates water from the pads which are constantly re-dampened  to continue the cooling process  then cooled  moist air is delivered into the building via a vent in the roof or wall because the cooling air originates outside the building  one or more large vents must exist to allow air to move from inside to outside  air should only be allowed to pass once through the system  or the cooling effect will decrease  this is due to the air reaching the saturation point  often 15  or so air changes per hour  achs  occur in spaces served by evaporative coolers  a relatively high rate of air exchange cooling towers are structures for cooling water or other heat transfer media to near-ambient  wet-bulb  temperature  wet cooling towers operate on the evaporative cooling principle  but are optimized to cool the water rather than the air  cooling towers can often be found on large buildings or on industrial sites  they transfer heat to the environment from chillers  industrial processes  or the rankine power cycle  for example misting systems work by forcing water via a high pressure pump and tubing through a brass and stainless steel mist nozzle that has an orifice of about 5  micrometres  thereby producing a micro-fine  mist  the water droplets that create the mist are so small that they instantly flash evaporate  flash evaporation can reduce the surrounding air temperature by as much as 35  °f (20  °c  in just for patio systems  it is ideal to mount the mist line approximately 8  to 10  feet (2.4  to 3.0  m  above the ground for optimum cooling  misting is used for applications such as flowerbeds  pets  livestock  kennels  insect control  odor control  zoos  veterinary clinics  cooling of produce  and greenhouses a misting fan is similar to a humidifier  a fan blows a fine mist of water into the air  if the air is not too humid  the water evaporates  absorbing heat from the air  allowing the misting fan to also work as an air cooler  a misting fan may be used outdoors  especially in a dry climate  it may also be used indoors small portable battery-powered  misting fans  consisting of an electric fan and a hand-operated  water spray pump  are sold as novelty items  their effectiveness in everyday use is needed understanding evaporative cooling performance requires an understanding of psychrometrics  evaporative cooling performance is variable due to changes in external temperature and humidity level  a residential cooler should be able to decrease the temperature of air by 3  to 4  °c or in fahrenheit scale by 5  to 7  °f  it is simple to predict cooler performance from standard weather report information  because weather reports usually contain the dewpoint and relative humidity  but not the wet-bulb  temperature  a psychrometric chart or a simple computer program must be used to compute the wet bulb temperature  once the wet bulb temperature and the dry bulb temperature are identified  the cooling performance or leaving air temperature of the cooler may be determined for direct evaporative cooling  the direct saturation efficiency  ϵ   displaystyle  epsilon     measures in what extent the temperature of the air leaving the direct evaporative cooler is close to the wet-bulb  temperature of the entering air  the direct saturation efficiency can be determined as followevaporative media efficiency usually runs between 80%  to 90%.  most efficient systems can lower the dry air temperature to 95%  of the wet-bulb  temperature  the least efficient systems only achieve the evaporation efficiency drops very little over time typical aspen pads used in residential evaporative coolers offer around 85%  efficiency while explanation needed  type of evaporative media offer efficiencies of >90%  depending on air velocity  the celdek media is more often used in large commercial and industrial installations as an example  in las vegas  nevada  with a typical summer design day of 42  °c (108  °f  db/19  °c (66  °f  wb or about 8%  relative humidity  with 85%  efficiency  the leaving air temperature of a residential cooler would be however  either of two methods can be used to estimate performance some examples clarify this relationship  cooling examples extracted from the june 25,  2000  university of idaho publication   homewise   because evaporative coolers perform best in dry conditions  they are widely used and most effective in arid  desert regions such as the southwestern usa and northern mexico the same equation indicates why evaporative coolers are of limited use in highly humid environments  for example  a hot august day in tokyo may be 30  °c (86  °f   85%  relative humidity  1,005  hpa pressure  this gives dew point 27.2  °c (81.0  °f  and wet-bulb  temperature 27.88  °c (82.18  °f   according to the formula above  at 85%  efficiency air may be cooled only down to 28.2  °c (82.8  °f  which makes it quite impractical comparison of evaporative cooling to refrigeration-based  air conditioning less
