 hurricane debbie (1969)  -  wikipediahurricane debbie was an intense and long-lived  hurricane that formed during august 1969.  the fifth tropical cyclone  fourth named storm  third hurricane and second major hurricane of the 1969  atlantic hurricane season  debbie formed on august 14  in the southern atlantic ocean and took a general northwesterly path until turning northward into the central atlantic  the storm was characterized by numerous fluctuations in intensity  and it reached winds corresponding to category 3  status on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale on four separate occasions  the hurricane bypassed the island of bermuda to the southeast on august 22,  before ultimately brushing southeastern newfoundland with strong winds  it dissipated over the cold waters east of greenland  although debbie had little effect on land  it was extensively researched and was subject to a weather modification experiment by project stormfury  in which it was seeded with silver iodide a disturbance associated with a tropical wave strengthened into a tropical depression on august the system had significantly organized by august and it intensified into a tropical storm at 1200  utc that upon its designation  debbie was moving west-northwestward  at approximately 15  mph (24  km h  and it was predicted to gradually gain it attained category 1  hurricane strength on august 16  as it turned toward the northwest  it continued to mature  and at around 1200  utc the next day  it achieved winds corresponding to category 2  on the saffir-simpson  hurricane scale  on august 18,  debbie further intensified to category 3  status  making it a major the storm quickly downgraded  and by august 19  it was once again at minimal hurricane force  at roughly the same time  it turned more to the west  although it maintained a general northwesterly the abrupt weakening may have been the result of a seeding experiment carried out on the storm in an attempt to deteriorate by later in the day  debbie had begun to restrengthen  it resumed category 3  intensity on august 20,  despite a minor oscillation in magnitude during the day  at this point  the cyclone acquired peak winds of 120  mph (195  km h   shortly thereafter  its lowest recorded barometric pressure fell to 951  storm turned northward on august and eventually curved northeastward  debbie weakened to category 2  strength but  for the fourth time  restrengthened to major hurricane the hurricane then passed well to the southeast of although it is believed that if not for the presence of nearby hurricane camille which emerged into the atlantic from the united states on august 20,  debbie would have likely ended up further west  closer to the it maintained its severity through august 22  as it continued generally toward the august 23,  the storm began a weakening trend and it turned towards the the next day  the storm—having weakened to category 1  status—skirted the southeastern tip of debbie began to lose its tropical characteristics as it accelerated towards the and it weakened into a tropical storm early on august as it moved over increasingly cold waters  it dissipated east of was subject to an experiment called project stormfury  which attempted to weaken tropical cyclones by seeding them with silver the storm provided an excellent opportunity to test the underpinnings of project stormfury  in many ways it was the perfect storm for seeding  it did not threaten any land  it passed within range of seeding aircraft  and was intense with a distinct on august 18  and again on august 20,  thirteen planes flew out to the storm to monitor and seed it  on the first day  windspeeds fell by 31%.  on the second day  windspeeds fell by both changes were consistent with stormfury s working hypothesis  the results were so encouraging that  a greatly expanded research program was among other conclusions was the need for frequent seeding at close to hourly remained predominately at sea throughout its 3,000  mi (4,800  km  path  and as a result  it caused little the storm had little or no impact on the island of bermuda as it passed to the later  winds of 50  to 65  mph (80  to 105  km h  were recorded over eastern
