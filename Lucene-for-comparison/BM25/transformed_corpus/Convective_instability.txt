 convective instability -  wikipediain meteorology  convective instability or stability of an air mass refers to its ability to resist vertical motion  a stable atmosphere makes vertical movement difficult  and small vertical disturbances dampen out and disappear  in an unstable atmosphere  vertical air movements  such as in orographic lifting  where an air mass is displaced upwards as it is blown by wind up the rising slope of a mountain range  tend to become larger  resulting in turbulent airflow and convective activity  instability can lead to significant turbulence  extensive vertical clouds  and severe weather such as cooling and heating are phenomena of rising or descending air  rising air expands and cools due to the decrease in air pressure as altitude increases  the opposite is true of descending air  as atmospheric pressure increases  the temperature of descending air increases as it is compressed  adiabatic heating and adiabatic cooling are terms used to describe this temperature change the adiabatic lapse rate is the rate at which the temperature of a rising or falling air mass lowers or increases per distance of vertical displacement  the ambient or environmental lapse rate is the temperature change in the (non-displaced)  air per vertical distance  instability results from difference between the adiabatic lapse rate of an air mass and the ambient lapse rate in the the adiabatic lapse rate is lower than the ambient lapse rate  an air mass displaced upward cools less rapidly than the air in which it is moving  hence  such an air mass becomes warmer relative to the atmosphere  as warmer air is less dense  such an air mass would tend to continue to rise conversely  if the adiabatic lapse rate is higher than the ambient lapse rate  an air mass displaced upward cools more rapidly than the air in which it is moving  hence  such an airmass becomes cooler relative to the atmosphere  as cooler air is more dense  the rise of such an airmass would tend to be resisted when air rises  moist air cools at a lower rate than dry air  that is  for the same vertical movement  a parcel of moist air will be warmer than a parcel of dry air  this is because of the condensation of water vapor in the air parcel due to expansion cooling  as water vapor condenses  latent heat is released into the air parcel  moist air has more water vapor than dry air  so more latent heat is released into the parcel of moist air as it rises  dry air does not have as much water vapor  therefore dry air cools at a higher rate with vertical movement than moist air  as a result of the latent heat that is released during water vapor condensation  moist air has a relatively lower adiabatic lapse rate than dry air  this makes moist air generally less stable than dry air  see convective available potential energy the dry adiabatic lapse rate  for unsaturated air  is 3  °c (5.4  °f  per 1,000  vertical feet (300  m   the moist adiabatic lapse rate varies from 1.1  to 2.8  °c (2.0  to 5.0  °f  per 1,000  vertical feet (300  m  the combination of moisture and temperature determine the stability of the air and the resulting weather  cool  dry air is very stable and resists vertical movement  which leads to good and generally clear weather  the greatest instability occurs when the air is moist and warm  as it is in the tropical regions in the summer  typically  thunderstorms appear on a daily basis in these regions due to the instability of the surrounding air the ambient lapse rate differs in different meteorological conditions  but  on average  is 2  °c (3.6  °f  per 1,000  vertical feet (300  m
