 convergent boundary -  wikipediain plate tectonics  a convergent boundary  also known as a destructive plate boundary  is a region of active deformation where two or more tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere are near the end of their life cycle  this is in contrast to a constructive plate boundary  also known as a mid-ocean  ridge or spreading center   as a result of pressure  friction  and plate material melting in the mantle  earthquakes and volcanoes are common near destructive boundaries  where subduction zones or an area of continental collision  depending on the nature of the plates involved  occurs  the subducting plate in a subduction zone is normally oceanic crust  and moves beneath the other plate  which can be made of either oceanic or continental crust  during collisions between two continental plates  large mountain ranges  such as the himalayas are formed  in other regions  a divergent boundary or transform faults may be present the reason for the existence of convergent boundaries are the mid-ocean  ridges that were only beginning to be understood with the acceptance of the theory of plate tectonics in the mid-1960s.  the radioactive decay of elements within the rocks in the interior of the earth generates large amounts of heat that moves magma to the surface of the crust in a process called mantle convection  this results in new oceanic crust or sea floor being formed that slowly moves away from the ridges  sometimes called spreading centers  towards the subduction zones  in other words  new sea floor originates from the upwelling rock as it emerges from the depths of the mantle and it slowly cools as it is transported over the millennia to the collision or subduction zones where it is consumed or shallow earthquakes on subduction zone interfaces are the largest types of earthquakes  they accounted for 90%  of the total seismic moment released for the period 1900â€“1989,  but these events usually occur offshore and far from population centers  non-subduction  interface earthquakes also occur in the region of the trench including shallow upper plate shocks  deeper events within the downgoing slab  and events that are related to outer trench volcanic arc is formed on the continental plate  above the location of the downgoing oceanic slab  the volcanic arc is the surface expression of the magma that is generated by hydrous melting of the mantle above the downgoing slab  hydrated minerals  e g   phlogopite  lawsonite  amphibole  within the oceanic lithosphere become unstable at certain depths due to increased temperature and pressure  causing the crystal structure of the hydrated minerals break down and release water  the buoyant fluids then rise into the asthenosphere  where they lower the melting temperature of the mantle and cause partial melting  these melts rise to the surface and are the source of some of the most explosive volcanism on earth because of their high volumes of extremely pressurized gases when two plates with oceanic crust converge  they typically create an island arc as one plate is subducted below the other  the arc is formed from volcanoes which erupt through the overriding plate as the descending plate melts below it  the arc shape occurs because of the spherical surface of the earth  nick the peel of an orange with a knife and note the arc formed by the straight-edge  of the knife   a deep oceanic trench is located in front of such arcs where the descending slab dips downward  such as the mariana trench near the mariana islands some convergent margins have zones of active seafloor spreading behind the island arc  known as back-arc  basins  when one plate is composed of oceanic lithosphere and the other is composed of continental lithosphere  the denser oceanic plate is subducted  often forming an orogenic belt and associated mountain range  this type of convergent boundary is similar to the andes or the cascade range in north america an oceanic trench is found where the denser plate is subducted underneath the other plate  there is water in the rocks of the oceanic plate  because they are underwater   and as this plate moves further down into the subduction zone  much of the water contained in the plate is squeezed out when the plate begins to subduct  however  the recrystallization of ocean floor rocks  such as serpentinite  which are unstable in the upper mantle  recrystallize into olivine  causing dehydration through loss of hydroxyl groups  this addition of water to the mantle causes partial melting of the mantle  generating magma  which then rises  and which normally results in volcanoes  this normally happens at a certain depth  about 70  to 80  miles below the earth s surface  and so volcanoes are formed fairly close to  but not right next to  the trench
