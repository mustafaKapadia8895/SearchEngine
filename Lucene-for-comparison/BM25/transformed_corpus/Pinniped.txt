 pinniped -  wikipediapinnipeds   ˈpɪnɪˌpɛdz    from latin pinna  fin  and pes  pedis commonly known as are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous  fin-footed,  semiaquatic marine mammals  they comprise the extant families odobenidae  whose only living member is the walrus   otariidae  the eared seals  sea lions and fur seals   and phocidae  the earless seals  or true seals   there are 33  extant species of pinnipeds  and more than 50  extinct species have been described from fossils  while seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines  molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage  descended from one ancestral line   pinnipeds belong to the order carnivora and their closest living relatives are bears and musteloids  weasels  raccoons  skunks  and red pandas   having diverged about 50  million years ago seals range in size from the 1  m (3  ft 3  in  and 45  kg (99  lb  baikal seal to the 5  m (16  ft  and 3,200  kg (7,100  lb  southern elephant seal  which is also the largest several species exhibit sexual dimorphism  they have streamlined bodies and four limbs that are modified into flippers  though not as fast in the water as dolphins  seals are more flexible and agile  otariids use their front limbs primarily to propel themselves through the water  while phocids and walruses use their hind limbs  otariids and walruses have hind limbs that can be pulled under the body and used as legs on land  by comparison  terrestrial locomotion by phocids is more cumbersome  otariids have visible external ears  while phocids and walruses lack these  pinnipeds have well-developed  senses—their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water  and they have an advanced tactile system in their whiskers or vibrissae  some species are well adapted for diving to great depths  they have a layer of fat  or blubber  under the skin to keep warm in the cold water  and  other than the walrus  all species are covered in fur although pinnipeds are widespread  most species prefer the colder waters of the northern and southern hemispheres  they spend most of their lives in the water  but come ashore to mate  give birth  molt or escape from predators  like sharks and killer whales  they feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates  but a few  like the leopard seal  feed on large vertebrates  such as penguins and other seals  walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling  mollusks  male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female  polygyny   although the degree of polygyny varies with the species  the males of land-breeding  species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice-  or water-breeding  species  male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females  defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating  pups are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them  mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts  walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea  seals produce a number of vocalizations  notably the barks of california sea lions  the gong-like  calls of walruses and the complex songs of weddell seals the meat  blubber and fur coats of pinnipeds have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the arctic  seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide  they are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks  once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for their products  seals and walruses are now protected by international law  the japanese sea lion and the caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century  while the mediterranean monk seal and hawaiian monk seal are ranked endangered by the international union for conservation of nature  besides hunting  pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping  marine pollution  and conflicts with local people ringed

to recognize the pinnipeds as a distinct taxonomic unit  in 1811  he gave the name pinnipedia to both a family and an american zoologist joel asaph allen reviewed the world s pinnipeds in an 1880  monograph  history of north american pinnipeds  a monograph of the walruses  sea-lions,  sea-bears  and seals of north america  in this publication  he traced the history of names  gave keys to families and genera  described north american species and provided synopses of species in other parts of the in 1989,  annalisa berta and colleagues proposed the unranked clade pinnipedimorpha to contain the fossil genus enaliarctos and modern seals as a sister pinnipeds belong to the order carnivora and the suborder caniformia  known as dog-like  pinnipedia was historically considered its own suborder under of the three extant families  the otariidae and odobenidae are grouped in the superfamily while the phocidae belong to the superfamily are also known as eared seals due to the presence of pinnae  these animals rely on their well-developed  fore-flippers  to propel themselves through the water  they can also turn their hind-flippers  forward and  walk  on the anterior end of an otariid s frontal bones extends between the nasal bones  and the supraorbital foramen is large and flat horizontally  the supraspinatous fossas are divided by a  secondary spine  and the bronchi are divided otariids consist of two types  sea lions and fur seals  sea lions are distinguished by their rounder snouts and shorter  rougher pelage  while fur seals have more pointed snouts  longer fore-flippers  and thicker fur coats that include an undercoat and guard hairs  the former also tend to be larger than the five genera and seven species  one now extinct  of sea lion are known to exist  while two genera and nine species of fur seal exist  while sea lions and fur seals have historically been considered separate subfamilies  otariinae and arctocephalinae respectively   a 2001  genetic study found that the northern fur seal is more closely related to several sea lion this is supported by a 2006  molecular study that also found that the australian sea lion and new zealand sea lion are more closely related to arctocephalus than to other sea consists of only one living member  the modern walrus  this animal is easily distinguished from other extant pinnipeds by its larger size  exceeded only by the elephant seals   nearly hairless skin and long upper canines  known as tusks  like otariids  walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers  forward and can walk on land  when moving in water  the walrus relies on its hind-flippers  for locomotion  while its fore-flippers  are used for steering  in addition  the walrus lacks external ear walruses have pterygoid bones that are broad and thick  frontal bones that are v-shaped  at the anterior end and calcaneuses with pronounced tuberosity in the are known as true or  earless  seals  these animals lack external ear flaps and are incapable of turning their hind-flippers  forward  which makes them more cumbersome on land  in water  true seals swim by moving their hind-flippers  and lower body from side to phocids have thickened mastoids  enlarged entotympanic bones  everted pelvic bones and massive ankle bones  they also lack supraorbital processes on the frontal and have underdeveloped calcaneal a 2006  molecular study supports the division of phocids into two monophyletic subfamilies  monachinae  which consists of mirounga  monachini and lobodontini  and phocinae  which includes pusa  phoca  halichoerus  histriophoca  pagophilus  erignathus and a 2012  review of pinniped taxonomy  berta and morgan churchill suggested that  based on morphological and genetic criteria  there are 33  extant species and 29  subspecies of pinnipeds  although five of the latter lack sufficient support to be conclusively considered subspecies  they recommend that the genus arctocephalus be limited to arctocephalus pusillus  and they resurrected the name arctophoca for several species and subspecies formerly placed in more than 50  fossil species have been popular hypothesis suggested that pinnipeds are diphyletic  descended from two ancestral lines   with walruses and otariids sharing a recent common ancestor with bears and phocids sharing one with musteloidea  however  morphological and molecular evidence support a monophyletic nevertheless  there is some dispute as to whether pinnipeds are more closely related to bears or musteloids  as some studies support the former and others the pinnipeds split from other caniforms 50  million years ago  mya  during the their evolutionary link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007  discovery of puijila darwini in early miocene deposits in nunavut  canada  like a modern otter  puijila had a long tail  short limbs and webbed feet instead of flippers  however  its limbs and shoulders were more robust and puijila likely had been a quadrupedal swimmer–retaining a form of aquatic locomotion that give rise to the major swimming types employed by modern pinnipeds  the researchers who found puijila placed it in a clade with potamotherium  traditionally considered a mustelid  and enaliarctos  of the three  puijila was the least specialized for aquatic life  the discovery of puijila in a lake deposit suggests that pinniped evolution went through a freshwater transitional a fossil species of late oligocene early miocene (24–22  mya  california  closely resembled modern pinnipeds  it was adapted to an aquatic life with a flexible spine  and limbs modified into flippers  its teeth were adapted for shearing  like terrestrial carnivorans   and it may have stayed near shore more often than its extant relatives  enaliarctos was capable of swimming with both the fore-flippers  and hind-flippers,  but it may have been more specialized as a fore-flipper  one species  enaliarctos emlongi  exhibited notable sexual dimorphism  suggesting that this physical characteristic may have been an important driver of pinniped a closer relative of extant pinnipeds was pteronarctos  which lived in oregon 19–15  mya  as in modern seals  pteroarctos had an orbital wall that was not limited by certain facial bones  like the jugal or lacrimal bone   but was mostly shaped by the lineages of otariidae and odobenidae split almost 28  otariids originated in the north pacific  the earliest fossil pithanotaria  found in california  is dated to 11  mya  the callorhinus lineage split earlier at 16  mya  zalophus  eumetopias and otaria diverged next  with the latter colonizing the coast of south america  most of the other otariids diversified in the southern hemisphere  the earliest fossils of odobenidae—prototaria of japan and proneotherium of oregon—date to 18–16  mya  these primitive walruses had much shorter canines and lived on a fish diet rather than a specialized mollusk diet like the modern walrus  odobenids further diversified in the middle and late miocene  several species had enlarged upper and lower canines  the genera valenictus and odobenus developed elongated tusks  the lineage of the modern walrus may have spread from the north pacific to the caribbean  via the central american seaway  8–5  mya and subsequently made it to the north atlantic and returned to the north pacific via the arctic 1  mya  alternatively  this lineage may have spread from the north pacific to the arctic and subsequently the north atlantic during the ancestors of the otarioidea and phocoidea diverged 33  the phocidae are likely to have descended from the extinct family desmatophocidae in the north atlantic  desmatophocids lived 23–10  mya and had elongated skulls  fairly large eyes  cheekbones connected by a mortised structure and rounded cheek teeth  they also were sexually dimorphic and may have been capable of propelling themselves with both the foreflippers and are known to have existed for at least 15  million and molecular evidence supports a divergence of the monachinae and phocinae lineages 22  the fossil monachine monotherium and phocine leptophoca were found in southeastern north america  the deep split between the lineages of erignathus and cystophora 17  mya suggests that the phocines migrated eastward and northward from the north atlantic  the genera phoca and pusa could have arisen when a phocine lineage traveled from the paratethys sea to the arctic basin and subsequently went eastward  the ancestor of the baikal seal migrated into lake baikal from the arctic  via the siberian ice sheet  and became isolated there  the caspian seal s ancestor became isolated as the paratethys shrank  leaving the animal in a small remnant sea  the caspian the monochines diversified southward  monachus emerged in the mediterranean and migrated to the caribbean and then the central north the two extant elephant seal species diverged close to 4  mya after the panamanian isthmus was the lobodontine lineage emerged around 9  mya and colonized the southern ocean in response to have streamlined  spindle-shaped  bodies with reduced or non-existent  external ear flaps  rounded heads  flexible necks  limbs modified into flippers  and small pinniped skulls have large eye orbits  short snouts and a constricted interorbital they are unique among carnivorans in that their orbital walls are significantly shaped by the maxilla and are not limited by certain facial compared to other carnivorans  their teeth tend to be fewer in number  especially incisors and back molars   are pointed and cone-shaped,  and lack the walrus has unique upper canines that are elongated into the mammary glands and genitals of pinnipeds can retract into the range in size from the 1  m (3  ft 3  in  and 45  kg (99  lb  baikal seal to the 5  m (16  ft  and 3,200  kg (7,100  lb  southern elephant seal  overall  they tend to be larger than other carnivorans  the southern elephant seal is the largest several species have male-biased  sexual dimorphism that correlates with the degree of polygyny in a species  highly polygynous species like elephant seals are extremely sexually dimorphic  while less polygynous species have males and females that are closer in size  in lobodontine seals  females are slightly larger than males  males of sexually dimorphic species also tend to have secondary sex characteristics  such as the prominent proboscis of elephant seals  the inflatable red nasal membrane of hooded seals and the thick necks and manes of despite a correlation between size dimorphism and the degree of polygyny  some evidence suggests that size differences between the sexes originated due to ecological differences and prior to the development of all pinnipeds have fur coats  the exception being the walrus  which is only sparsely covered  even some fully furred species  particularly sea lions  are less haired than most land in species that live on ice  young pups have thicker coats than adults  the individual hairs on the coat  known collectively as lanugo  can trap heat from sunlight and keep the pup pinnipeds are typically countershaded  and are darker colored dorsally and lighter colored ventrally  which serves to eliminate shadows caused by light shining over the ocean water  the pure white fur of harp seal pups conceals them in their arctic some species  such as ribbon seals  ringed seals and leopard seals  have patterns of contrasting light and dark coloration  all fully furred species molt  phocids molt once a year  while otariids gradually molt all seals have a layer of subcutaneous fat known as blubber that is particularly thick in phocids and blubber serves both to keep the animals warm and to provide energy and nourishment when they are fasting  it can constitute as much as 50%  of a pinniped s body weight  pups are born with only a thin layer of blubber  but some species compensate for this with thick have a simple stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores  most species have neither a cecum nor a clear demarcation between the small and large intestines  the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the latter  small intestine lengths range from 8   california sea lion  to 25  times  elephant seal  the body length  the length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving  as the increased volume of the digestive tract serves as an extended storage compartment for partially digested food during submersion  pinnipeds do not have an as in most marine mammals  the kidneys are divided into small lobes and can effectively absorb water and filter out excess have two pairs of flippers on the front and back  the fore-flippers  and hind-flippers.  the elbows and ankles are enclosed within the pinnipeds tend to be slower swimmers than cetaceans  typically cruising at 5–15  kn (9–28  km h  6–17  mph  compared to around 20  kn (37  km h  23  mph  for several species of dolphin  seals are more agile and and some otariids  such as the california sea lion  are capable of bending their necks backwards far enough to reach their hind-flippers,  allowing them to make dorsal pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing drag  in addition to their streamlined bodies  they have smooth networks of muscle bundles in their skin that may increase laminar flow and make it easier for them to slip through water  they also lack arrector pili  so their fur can be streamlined as they swimming  otariids rely on their fore-flippers  for locomotion in a wing-like  manner similar to penguins and sea fore-flipper  movement is not continuous  and the animal glides between each compared to terrestrial carnivorans  the fore-limbs  of otariids are reduced in length  which gives the locomotor muscles at the shoulder and elbow joints greater mechanical the hind-flippers  serve as phocids and walruses swim by moving their hind-flippers  and lower body from side to while their fore-flippers  are mainly used for some species leap out of the water  which may allow then to travel faster  in addition  sea lions are known to  ride  waves  which probably helps them decrease their energy can move around on land  though not as well as terrestrial animals  otariids and walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers  forward and under the body so they can  walk  on all the fore-flippers  move in a transverse  rather than a sagittal fashion  otariids rely on the movements of their heads and necks more than their hind-flippers  during terrestrial by swinging their heads and necks  otariids create momentum while they are moving  sea lions have been recorded climbing up flights of stairs  phocids are less agile on land  they cannot pull their hind-flippers  forward  and move on land by lunging  bouncing and wiggling while their fore-flippers  keep them balanced  some species use their fore-flippers  to pull themselves forward  terrestrial locomotion is easier for phocids on ice  as they can sled eyes of pinnipeds are relatively large for their size and are positioned near the front of the head  one exception is the walrus  whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its this is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute a seal s eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air  the lens is mostly spherical  and much of the retina is equidistant from the lens center  the cornea has a flattened center where refraction is nearly equal in both water and air  pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized irises  the well-developed  dilator muscle gives the animals a great range in pupil dilation  when contracted  the pupil is typically pear-shaped,  although the bearded seal s is more diagonal  in species that live in shallow water  such as harbor seals and california sea lions  dilation varies little  while the deep-diving  elephant seals have much greater land  pinnipeds are near-sighted  in dim light  this is reduced in bright light  as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea s ability to bend light  they also have a well-developed  tapetum lucidum  a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods  this helps them see in low-light  ice-living  seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright  snowy environments  as such  they do not suffer snow pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision  as they lack flexible eye movement has been documented in the extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed  this and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their the corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving  as in many mammals and birds  pinnipeds possess nictitating pinniped ear is adapted for hearing underwater  where it can hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000  hz  in air  hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals  while they are capable of hearing a wide range of frequencies  e g  500  to 32,000  hz in the northern fur seal  compared to 20  to 20,000  hz in humans   their airborne hearing sensitivity is weaker one study of three species—the harbor seal  california sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing  the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water  and the elephant seal was better adapted for underwater although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on it is useless underwater as their nostrils are have well-developed  tactile senses  their mystacial vibrissae have ten times the innervation of terrestrial mammals  allowing them to effectively detect vibrations in the these vibrations are generated  for example  when a fish swims through water  detecting vibrations is useful when the animals are foraging and may add to or even replace vision  particularly in harbor seals have been observed following varying paths of another seal that swam ahead several minutes before  similar to a dog following a scent and even to discriminate the species and the size of the fish responsible for the blind ringed seals have even been observed successfully hunting on their own in lake saimaa  likely relying on their vibrissae to gain sensory information and catch terrestrial mammals  such as rodents  pinnipeds do not move their vibrissae over an object when examining it but instead extend their moveable whiskers and keep them in the same by holding their vibrissae steady  pinnipeds are able to maximize their detection the vibrissae of phocids are undulated and wavy while otariid and walrus vibrissae are research is ongoing to determine the function  if any  of these shapes on detection ability  the vibrissa s angle relative to the flow  not the shape  however  seems to be the most important the vibrissae of some otariids grow quite long—those of the antarctic fur seal can reach 41  cm (16  walruses have the most vibrissae  at 600–700  individual hairs  these are important for detecting their prey on the muddy sea floor  in addition to foraging  vibrissae may also play a role in navigation  spotted seals appear to use them to detect breathing holes in the diving  pinnipeds typically exhale to empty their lungs of half the and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle  and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper while terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory the middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives  preventing middle ear the heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate  the trachea is flexible enough to collapse under during deep dives  any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea  which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness  oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis  in addition  seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid  which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical main adaptations of the pinniped circulatory system for diving are the enlargement and increased complexity of veins to increase their capacity  retia mirabilia form blocks of tissue on the inner wall of the thoracic cavity and the body periphery  these tissue masses  which contain extensive contorted spirals of arteries and thin-walled  veins  act as blood reservoirs that increase oxygen stores for use during as with other diving mammals  pinnipeds have high amounts of hemoglobin and myoglobin stored in their blood and muscles  this allows them to stay submerged for long periods of time while still having enough oxygen  deep-diving  species such as elephant seals have blood volumes that make up to 20%  of their body weight  when diving  they reduce their heart rate and maintain blood flow only to the heart  brain and lungs  to keep their blood pressure stable  phocids have an elastic aorta that dissipates some energy of each conserve heat with their large and compact body size  insulating blubber and fur  and high in addition  the blood vessels in their flippers are adapted for countercurrent exchange  veins containing cool blood from the body extremities surround arteries  which contain warm blood received from the core of the body  heat from the arterial blood is transferred to the blood vessels  which then recirculate blood back to the the same adaptations that conserve heat while in water tend to inhibit heat loss when out of water  to counteract overheating  many species cool off by flipping sand onto their backs  adding a layer of cool  damp sand that enhances heat loss  the northern fur seal pants to help stay cool  while monk seals often dig holes in the sand to expose cooler layers to rest spend many months at a time at sea  so they must sleep in the water  scientists have recorded them sleeping for minutes at a time while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up  orientation  like other marine mammals  seals sleep in water with half of their brain awake so that they can detect and escape from when they are asleep on land  both sides of their brain go into sleep pinnipeds mainly inhabit polar and subpolar regions  particularly the north atlantic  the north pacific and the southern ocean  they are entirely absent from indo-malayan  monk seals and some otariids live in tropical and subtropical waters  seals usually require cool  nutrient-rich  waters with temperatures lower than 20  °c (68  °f   even those that live in warm or tropical climates live in areas that become cold and nutrient rich due to current only monk seals live in waters that are not typically cool or rich in the caspian seal and baikal seal are found in large landlocked bodies of water  the caspian sea and lake baikal respectively  as a whole  pinnipeds can be found in a variety of aquatic habitats  including coastal water  open ocean  brackish water and even freshwater lakes and rivers  most species inhabit coastal areas  though some travel offshore and feed in deep waters off oceanic islands  the baikal seal is the only freshwater species  though some ringed seals live in freshwater lakes in russia close to the baltic sea  in addition  harbor seals may visit estuaries  lakes and rivers and sometimes stay as long as a year  other species known to enter freshwater include california sea lions and south american sea pinnipeds also use a number of terrestrial habitats and substrates  both continental and island  in temperate and tropical areas  they haul-out  on to sandy and pebble beaches  rocky shores  shoals  mud flats  tide pools and in sea caves  some species also rest on man-made  structures  like piers  jetties  buoys and oil platforms  pinnipeds may move further inland and rest in sand dunes or vegetation  and may even climb polar-living  species haul-out  on to both fast ice and drift have an amphibious lifestyle  they spend most of their lives in the water  but haul-out  to mate  raise young  molt  rest  thermoregulate or escape from aquatic predators  several species are known to migrate vast distances  particularly in response to extreme environmental changes  like el niño or changes in ice cover  elephant seals stay at sea 8–10  months a year and migrate between breeding and molting sites  the northern elephant seal has one of the longest recorded migration distances for a mammal  at 18,000–21,000  km (11,000–13,000  mi   phocids tend to migrate more than traveling seals may use various features of their environment to reach their destination including geomagnetic fields  water and wind currents  the position of the sun and moon and the taste and temperature of the may dive during foraging or to avoid predators  when foraging  weddell seals typically dive for less than 15  minutes to depths of around 400  m (1,300  ft  but can dive for as long as 73  minutes and to depths of up to 600  m (2,000  ft   northern elephant seals commonly dive 350–650  m (1,150–2,130  ft  for as long as 20  minutes  they can also dive 1,259–4,100  m (4,131–13,451  ft  and for as long as 62  minutes  the dives of otariids tend to be shorter and less deep  they typically last 5–7  minutes with average depths to 30–45  m (98–148  ft   however  the new zealand sea lion has been recorded diving to a maximum of 460  m (1,510  ft  and a duration of 12  walruses do not often dive very deep  as they feed in shallow have lifespans averaging 25–30  years  females usually live longer  as males tend to fight and often die before reaching the longest recorded lifespans include 43  years for a wild female ringed seal and 46  years for a wild female grey the age at which a pinniped sexually matures can vary from 2–12  years depending on the species  females typically mature earlier than pinnipeds are carnivorous and predatory  as a whole  they mostly feed on fish and cephalopods  followed by crustaceans and bivalves  and then zooplankton and endothermic ("warm-blooded")  prey like sea while most species are generalist and opportunistic feeders  a few are specialists  examples include the crabeater seal  which primarily eats krill  the ringed seal  which eats mainly crustaceans  the ross seal and southern elephant seal  which specialize on squid  and the bearded seal and walrus  which feed on clams and other bottom-dwelling  pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively  the former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling  fish  slow-moving  or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey  solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters  bays and rivers  an exception to this is the northern elephant seal  which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean  in addition  walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison  when large schools of fish or squid are available  pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups  locating and herding their prey  some species  such as california and south american sea lions  may forage with cetaceans and sea typically consume their prey underwater where it is swallowed whole  prey that is too large or awkward is taken to the surface to be torn the leopard seal  a prolific predator of penguins  is known to violently swing its prey back and forth until it is the elaborately cusped teeth of filter-feeding  species  such as crabeater seals  allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic the walrus is unique in that it consumes its prey by suction feeding  using its tongue to suck the meat of a bivalve out of the while pinnipeds mostly hunt in the water  south american sea lions are known to chase down penguins on some species may swallow stones or pebbles for reasons not though they can drink seawater  pinnipeds get most of their fluid intake from the food they themselves are subject to predation  most species are preyed on by the killer whale or orca  to subdue and kill seals  orcas continuously ram them with their heads  slap them with their tails and fling them in the air  they are typically hunted by groups of 10  or fewer whales  but they are occasionally hunted by larger groups or by lone individuals  pups are more commonly taken by orcas  but adults can be targeted as well  large sharks are another major predator of pinnipeds—usually the great white shark but also the tiger shark and mako shark  sharks usually attack by ambushing them from below  the prey usually escapes  and seals are often seen with shark-inflicted  wounds  otariids typically have injuries in the hindquarters  while phocids usually have injuries on the are also targeted by terrestrial and pagophilic predators  the polar bear is well adapted for hunting arctic seals and walruses  particularly pups  bears are known to use sit-and-wait  tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water  other terrestrial predators include cougars  brown hyenas and various species of canids  which mostly target the pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines—an adult walrus is capable of killing polar when out at sea  northern elephant seals dive out of the reach of surface-hunting  orcas and white in the antarctic  which lacks terrestrial predators  pinniped species spend more time on the ice than their arctic arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual  appear more restless when hauled out  and rarely defecate on the ice  ringed seals build dens underneath fast ice for predation among pinnipeds does occur  the leopard seal is known to prey on numerous other species  especially the crabeater seal  leopard seals typically target crabeater pups  which form an important part of their diet from november to january  older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks  a 1977  study found that 75%  of a sample of 85  individual crabeaters had these walruses  despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling  invertebrates  occasionally prey on arctic seals  they kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin  steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals  northern fur seals and california sea lions  new zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species  and the south american sea lion may prey on south american fur mating system of pinnipeds varies from extreme polygyny to serial of the 33  species  20  breed on land  and the remaining 13  breed on species that breed on land are usually polygynous  as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with them as well as defend them from rivals  polygynous species include elephant seals  grey seals and most land-breeding  pinnipeds tend to mate on islands where there are fewer terrestrial predators  few islands are favorable for breeding  and those that are tend to be crowded  since the land they breed on is fixed  females return to the same sites for many years  the males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them  the males stay on land and try to mate with as many females as they can  some of them will even fast  if a male leaves the beach to feed  he will likely lose mating opportunities and his polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males  this dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks  longer canines and denser fur—all traits that help males in fights for females  increased body weight in males increases the length of time they can fast due to the ample energy reserves stored in the larger males also likely enjoy access to feeding grounds that smaller ones are unable to access due to their lower thermoregulatory ability and decreased energy in some instances  only the largest males are able to reach the furthest deepest foraging grounds where they enjoy maximum energetic yields that are unavailable to smaller males and seals  like the walrus and most phocids  breed on ice with copulation usually taking place in the water  a few land-breeding  species also mate in females of these species tend to aggregate less  in addition  since ice is less stable than solid land  breeding sites change location each year  and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season  hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding  species  an exception to this is the walrus  where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources  pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack some of these species are serially monogamous  including the harp seal  crabeater seal and hooded seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism  in lobodontine seals  females are slightly longer than males  walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding  species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of male pinnipeds have several strategies to ensure reproductive success  otariids establish territories containing resources that attract females  such as shade  tide pools or access to water  territorial boundaries are usually marked by natural breaks in the and males defend their territorial boundaries with threatening vocalizations and postures  but physical fights are usually individuals also return to the same territorial site each breeding season  in certain species  like the steller sea lion and northern fur seal  a dominant male can maintain a territory for as long as 2–3  months  females can usually move freely between territories and males are unable to coerce them  but in some species such as the northern fur seal  south american sea lion and australian sea lion  males can successfully contain females in their territories and prevent them from leaving  in some phocid species  like the harbor seal  weddell seal and bearded seal  the males have underwater territories called  maritories  near female haul-out  these are also maintained by the maritories of weddell seal males can overlap with female breathing holes in the systems are known to exist among some populations of these males cluster around females and try to attract them with elaborate courtship displays and lekking may also exist among california sea lions  south american fur seals  new zealand sea lions and harbor in some species  including elephant seals and grey seals  males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems of as many as 30–100  females  these males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference  they will  however  break off mating to chase off a grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over male harp seals  crabeater seals and hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a wait for them to reach or subdominant male pinnipeds may attempt to achieve reproductive success in other ways  subadult elephant seals will sneak into female clusters and try to blend in by pulling in their noses  they also harass and attempt to mate with females that head out to the water  in otariid species like the south american and australian sea lions  non-territorial  subadults form  gangs  and cause chaos within the breeding rookeries to increase their chances of mating with alternative mating strategies also exist in young male grey seals  which do have some female pinnipeds do appear to have some choice in mates  particularly in lek-breeding  species like the walrus  but also in elephant seals where the males try to dominate all the females that they want to mate when a female elephant seal or grey seal is mounted by an unwanted male  she tries to squirm and get away  while croaking and slapping him with her tail  this commotion attracts other males to the scene  and the most dominant will end the copulation and attempt to mate with the female dominant female elephant seals stay in the center of the colony where they are more likely to mate with a dominant male  while peripheral females are more likely to mate with female steller sea lions are known to solicit mating with their territorial the exception of the walrus  which has five-  to six-year-long  inter-birth  intervals  female pinnipeds enter estrous shortly after they give all species go through delayed implantation  wherein the embryo remains in suspended development for weeks or months before it is implanted in the uterus  delayed implantation postpones the birth of young until the female hauls-out  on land or until conditions for birthing are gestation in seals  including delayed implantation  typically lasts a for most species  birthing takes place in the spring and summer typically  single pups are twins are uncommon and have high mortality pups of most species are born unlike terrestrial mammals  pinniped milk has little to no pinnipeds have different strategies for maternal care and lactation  phocids such as elephant seals  grey seals and hooded seals remain on land or ice and fast during their relatively short lactation period–four days for the hooded seal and five weeks for elephant seals  the milk of these species consist of up to 60%  fat  allowing the young to grow fairly quickly  in particular  northern elephant seal pups gain 4  kg (9  lb  each day before they are weaned  some pups may try to steal extra milk from other nursing mothers and gain weight more quickly than others  alloparenting occurs in these fasting while most northern elephant seal mothers nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups  some do accept alien pups with their otariids and some phocids like the harbor seal  mothers fast and nurse their pups for a few days at a time  in between nursing bouts  the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea  these foraging trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks  depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites  while their mothers are away  the pups will lactation in otariids may last 6–11  months  in the galápagos fur seal it can last as long as 3  years  pups of these species are weaned at lower weights than their phocid walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at the female rests at the surface with its head held up  and the young suckle upside young pinnipeds typically learn to swim on their own and some species can even swim at birth  other species may wait days or weeks before entering the water  elephant seals do not swim until weeks after they are pinnipeds generally play little role in raising the male walruses may help inexperienced young as they learn to swim  and have even been recorded caring for male california sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from males can also pose threats to the safety of pups  in terrestrially breeding species  pups may get crushed by fighting subadult male south america sea lions sometimes abduct pups from their mothers and treat them like adult males treat females  this helps them gain experience in controlling females  pups can get severely injured or killed during can produce a number of vocalizations such as barks  grunts  rasps  rattles  growls  creaks  warbles  trills  chirps  chugs  clicks and whistles  vocals are produced both in air and underwater  otariids are more vocal on land  while phocids are more vocal in water  antarctic seals are more vocal on land or ice than arctic seals due to a lack of terrestrial and pagophliic predators like the polar male vocals are usually of lower frequencies than those of the vocalizations are particularly important during the breeding seasons  dominant male elephant seals advertise their status and threaten rivals with "clap-threats"  and loud drum-like  that may be modified by the male otariids have strong barks  growls  roars and  whickers   male walruses are known to produce distinctive gong-like  calls when attempting to attract females  they can also create somewhat musical sounds with their inflated weddell seal has perhaps the most elaborate vocal repertoire with separate sounds for airborne and underwater underwater vocals include trills  chugs  chirps  chugs and knocks  the calls appear to contain prefixes and suffixes that serve to emphasize a the underwater vocals of weddell seals can last 70  seconds  which is long for a marine mammal call  some calls have around seven rhythm patterns and are comparable to birdsongs and similar calls have been recorded in other lobodontine and in bearded in some pinniped species  there appear to be geographic differences in vocalizations  known as while certain species may even have individual variations in these differences are likely important for mothers and pups who need to remain in contact on crowded otariid females and their young use mother-pup  attraction calls to help them reunite when the mother returns from foraging at the calls are described are  loud  and female elephant seals make an unpulsed attraction call when responding to their young  and a harsh  pulsed call when threatened by other females  males or alien pups may also vocalize when playing  in distress or when prodding their mothers to allow them to most vocals are audible to the human ear  a captive leopard seal was recorded making ultrasonic calls underwater  in addition  the vocals of northern elephant seals may produce infrasonic vibrations  non-vocal  communication is not as common in pinnipeds as in cetaceans  nevertheless  when disturbed by intruders harbor seals and baikal seals may slap their fore-flippers  against their bodies as warnings  teeth chattering  hisses and exhalations are also made as aggressive warnings  visual displays also occur  weddell seals will make an s-shaped  posture when patrolling under the ice  and ross seals will display the stripes on their chests and teeth when male hooded seals use their inflatable nasal membranes to display to and attract a match-to-sample  task study  a single california sea lion was able to demonstrate an understanding of symmetry  transitivity and equivalence  a second seal was unable to complete the they demonstrate the ability to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language  though they only rarely used the signs semantically or in 2011,  a captive california sea lion named ronan was recorded bobbing its head in synchrony to musical rhythms  this  rhythmic entrainment  was previously seen only in humans  parrots and other birds possessing vocal in 1971,  a captive harbor seal named hoover was trained to imitate human words  phrases and for sea lions used in entertainment  trainers toss a ball at the animal so it may accidentally balance it or hold the ball on its nose  thereby gaining an understanding of the behavior desired  it may require a year to train a sea lion to perform a trick for the public  its long-term  memory allows it to perform a trick after at least three months of human cultures have depicted pinnipeds for millennia  the anthropologist  a  asbjørn jøn  has analysed beliefs of the celts of orkney and hebrides who believed in selkies—seals that could change into humans and walk on seals are also of great importance in the culture of the in inuit mythology  the goddess sedna rules over the sea and marine animals  she is depicted as a mermaid  occasionally with a seal s lower body  in one legend  seals  whales and other marine mammals were formed from her severed one of the earliest ancient greek coins depicts the head of a seal  and the animals were mentioned by homer and aristotle  the greeks believed that seals loved both the sea and sun and were considered to be under the protection of the gods poseidon and the moche people of ancient peru worshipped the sea and its animals  and often depicted sea lions in their in modern popular culture  pinnipeds are often depicted as playful and comical figures based on their performances in zoos  circuses and marine mammal parks pinnipeds can be found in facilities around the world  as their large size and playfulness make them popular seals have been kept in captivity since at least ancient rome and their trainability was noted by pliny the some modern exhibits have rocky backgrounds with artificial haul-out  sites and a pool  while others have pens with small rocky  elevated shelters where the animals can dive into their pools  more elaborate exhibits contain deep pools that can be viewed underwater with rock-mimicking  cement as haul-out  areas  the most common pinniped species kept in captivity is the california sea lion as it is abundant and easy to other species popularly kept in captivity include the grey seal and harbor seal  larger animals like walruses and steller sea lions are much less some organizations  such as the humane society of the united states and world animal protection  object to keeping pinnipeds and other marine mammals in captivity  they state that the exhibits could not be large enough to house animals that have evolved to be migratory  and a pool could never replace the size and biodiversity of the ocean  they also oppose using them for entertainment  claiming the tricks performed are  exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors  and distract the audience from the animal s unnatural sea lions are used in military applications by the u s  navy marine mammal program  including detecting naval mines and enemy divers  in the persian gulf  the animals have been trained to swim behind divers approaching a u s  naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver s leg  navy officials say that the sea lions can do this in seconds  before the enemy realizes what organizations like peta believe that such operations put the animals in the navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their mission is have hunted seals since the stone age  originally  seals were hit with clubs during haul-out.  eventually  seal hunters used harpoons to spear the animals from boats out at sea  and hooks for killing pups on ice or land  they were also trapped in nets  the use of firearms in seal hunting during the modern era drastically increased the number of killings  pinnipeds are typically hunted for their meat and blubber  the skins of fur seals and phocids are made into coats  and the tusks of walruses continue to be used for carvings or as there is a distinction between the subsistence hunting of seals by indigenous peoples of the arctic and commercial hunting  subsistence hunters typically use seal products for themselves and depend on them for national and international authorities have given special treatment to aboriginal hunters since their methods of killing are seen as less destructive and wasteful  this distinction is being questioned as indigenous people are using more modern weaponry and mechanized transport to hunt with  and are selling seal products in the marketplace  some anthropologists argue that the term  subsistence  should also apply to these cash-based  exchanges as long as they take place within local production and consumption  more than 100,000  phocids  especially ringed seals  as well as around 10,000  walruses are harvested annually by native sealing was historically just as important an industry as whaling  exploited species included harp seals  hooded seals  caspian seals  elephant seals  walruses and all species of fur the scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the after the canadian government reduced the length of the hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers  for example  antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting  the northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th  century  with only a small population remaining on guadalupe island  it has since recolonized much of its historic range  but has a population conversely  the mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range  which stretched from the mediterranean to the black sea and northwest africa  and only remains in the northeastern mediterranean and some parts of northwest species of pinniped continue to be harvested  the convention for the conservation of antarctic seals allows limited hunting of crabeater seals  leopard seals and weddell seals  however  weddell seal hunting is prohibited between september and february if the animal is over one year of age  to ensure breeding stocks are healthy  other species protected are southern elephant seals  ross seals and antarctic fur the government of canada permits the hunting of harp seals  this has been met with controversy and debate  proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated  pups are not taken  while opponents argue that it is irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining caribbean monk seal has been killed and exploited by europeans settlers and their descendants since 1494,  starting with christopher columbus himself  the seals were easy targets for organized sealers  fishermen  turtle hunters and buccaneers because they evolved with little pressure from terrestrial predators and were thus  genetically tame   in the bahamas  as many as 100  seals were slaughtered in one night  in the mid-nineteenth  century  the species was thought to have gone extinct until a small colony was found near the yucatán peninsula in 1886.  seal killings continued  and the last reliable report of the animal alive was in 1952.  the iucn declared it extinct in the japanese sea lion was common around the japanese islands  but overexploitation and competition from fisheries drastically decreased the population in the 1930s.  the last recorded individual was a juvenile in of 2013,  the international union for conservation of nature  iucn  recognizes 35  pinniped species  with the japanese sea lion and the caribbean monk seal recently extinct  ten more are considered at risk  as they are ranked  critically endangered   the mediterranean and hawaiian monk seals    endangered   galápagos fur seal  australian sea lion  caspian seal and galápagos sea lion   and  vulnerable   northern fur seal  hooded seal and new zealand sea lion   three species—the walrus  the ribbon seal  and the spotted seal—have a  data deficient  species that live in polar habitats are vulnerable to the effects of recent and ongoing climate change  particularly declines in sea there has been some debate over the cause of the decline of steller sea lions in alaska since the species have become so numerous that they conflict with local people  in the united states  pinnipeds are protected under the marine mammal protection act of 1972   mmpa   since that year  california sea lion populations have risen to 250,000.  these animals began exploiting more man-made  environments  like docks  for haul-out  sites  many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions  wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals  and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand use by sea sea lions also conflict with fisherman since both depend on the same fish in 2007,  mmpa was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from salmon runs at bonneville the 2007  law seeks to relieve pressure on the crashing pacific northwest salmon wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted to ward off the sea lions using bombs  rubber bullets and bean efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven critics like the humane society object to the killing of the sea lions  claiming that hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the similar conflicts have existed in south africa with brown fur seals  in the 1980s  and 1990s,  south african politicians and fisherman demanded that the fur seals be culled  believing that the animals competed with commercial fisheries  scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually have a negative effect on the fishing industry  and the culling option was dropped in are also threatened by humans indirectly  they are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries and accidentally swallow fishing hooks  gillnetting and seine netting is a significant cause of mortality in seals and other marine mammals  species commonly entangled include california sea lions  hawaiian monk seals  northern fur seals and brown fur pinnipeds are also affected by marine pollution  high levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are near the top of food chains and have large reserves of blubber  lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young  these pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers  decreased reproductivity and greater vulnerability to infectious other man-made  threats include habitat destruction by oil and gas exploitation  encroachment by and underwater
