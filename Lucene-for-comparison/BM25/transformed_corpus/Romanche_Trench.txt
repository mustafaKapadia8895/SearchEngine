 romanche trench -  wikipediathe romanche trench  also called the romanche furrow or romanche gap  is the third deepest of the major trenches of the atlantic ocean  after the puerto rico trench and the south sandwich trench  it bisects the mid-atlantic  ridge  mar  just north of the equator at the narrowest part of the atlantic between brazil and west africa  extending from 2°n  to 2°s  and from 16°w  to 20°w.  the trench has been formed by the actions of the romanche fracture zone  a portion of which is an active transform boundary offsetting sections of the mid-atlantic  trench has a depth of 7,761  m (25,463  ft   is 300  km (190  mi  long and has an average width of 19  km (12  mi  and allows for a major circulation of deep ocean basin water from the west atlantic to the east atlantic basins  deep water flow through the trench is from west to east with a rate of 3.6  sverdrups  million m³ s  of 1.57  °c (34.83  °f  north atlantic deep water  lnadw  is found around 3,600–4,000  metres (11,800–13,100  ft  below sea level and flows from the greenland and norwegian seas  it brings high salinity  oxygen  and freon concentrations towards the equator  antarctic bottom water  aabw  flows below the lnadw and reaches down to the seafloor  formed around antarctica  the aabw is cold  has low salinity  and high silicate concentration  as it flows north  it is constrained by numerous obstacles on the seafloor  in the basin on the eastern side of the mar the walvis ridge blocks the northward passage  for lnadw and aabw  the romanche and chain fracture zones  just south of the equator  are the only deep passages in the mar where interbasin exchange is possible  as aabw flows through the romanche fracture zone  salinity and temperature increase significantly  romanche fracture zone offsets the mid-atlantic  ridge by 900  km (560  mi   making it the largest equatorial fracture zone in the atlantic  according to the normal scenario for the opening of the south atlantic  it is spreading at a rate of 1.75  cm year (0.69  in year  and began forming about 50  ma  north of and parallel to the fracture zone is a transverse ridge which is particularly prominent over hundreds of kilometres east and west of the mab of the south atlantic  the western part of the transverse ridge consists of fragments of uplifted oceanic crust and upper mantle  the summit of the transverse ridge is capped by miocene shallow water limestones that reached above sea level 20  ma before subsiding abnormally fast  the eastern part of the transverse ridge  however  consists of a thick sequence of stratified material called the romanche sedimentary sequence  rss   the rss includes pelagic material from the early cretaceous (140  ma  which  coupled with the thickness of the sequence  does not fit with the normal scenario for the opening of the south atlantic around the aptian-albian  (125–100  the transverse ridge separates the present trench from an 800  km (500  mi)-long  aseismic valley where the romanche transform was located until about 10–8  ma  this transform migration was preceded by a process 25–17  ma during which the miocene shallow-water  platform mentioned above reached sea level as the transverse ridge was first uplifted  then deformed  and finally buried under the hydrothermal vents of the mar support many life forms  the romanche and chain fracture zones creates a huge gap in the mar and can act as a  subsea berlin wall  segregating the north atlantic communities from those in other swarms of hydrothermal shrimps reminiscent of those found from northern mar vent-sites  have been found on the northern part of the southern mar  bivalve communities have been reported around vents further south  these species await a formal description and it is not known whether or not they represent communities distinct from those on the northern the flow of nadw through the romanche and chain fracture zones may serve as a conduit for larval transport from the western north atlantic to the eastern south atlantic  for example  the caridean shrimp alvinocaris muricola inhabits cold seeps in both the gulf of mexico and the gulf of guinea  which clearly suggests a gene flow across the atlantic  but the amount of data is very limited and dispersal pathways are not fully 0°00′n  18°00′w﻿    ﻿0.000°n  18.000°w﻿    0.000;  -18.000
