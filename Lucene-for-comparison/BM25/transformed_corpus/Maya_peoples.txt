 maya peoples -  wikipediathe maya people  sometimes mayans  are a group of indigenous peoples of mesoamerica  they inhabit southern mexico  guatemala  belize  el salvador and honduras  the overarching term  maya  is a collective designation to include the peoples of the region that share some degree of cultural and linguistic heritage  however  the term embraces many distinct populations  societies  and ethnic groups that each have their own particular traditions  cultures  and historical identity the pre-columbian  maya population was approximately eight there were an estimated seven million maya living in this area at the start of the 21st  guatemala  southern mexico and the yucatán peninsula  belize  el salvador  and western honduras have managed to maintain numerous remnants of their ancient cultural heritage  some are quite integrated into the majority hispanicized mestizo cultures of the nations in which they reside  while others continue a more traditional  culturally distinct life  often speaking one of the mayan languages as a primary language the largest populations of contemporary maya inhabit guatemala  belize  and the western portions of honduras and el salvador  as well as large segments of population within the mexican states of yucatán  campeche  quintana roo  tabasco  and chiapas one of the largest groups of modern maya can be found in mexico s yucatán state and the neighboring states of campeche  quintana roo and in belize  these peoples commonly identify themselves simply as  maya  with no further ethnic subdivision  unlike in the highlands of western guatemala   they speak the language which anthropologists term  yucatec maya   but is identified by speakers and yucatecos simply as  maya   among maya speakers  spanish is commonly spoken as a second or first language there is a significant amount of confusion as to the correct terminology to use—maya or mayan—and the meaning of these words with reference to contemporary or pre-columbian  peoples  to maya peoples in different parts of mexico  guatemala  belize  and to languages or peoples  ahau was the katun when they founded the cah of mayapan  they were called maya men  in 8  ahau their lands were destroyed and they were scattered through out the peninsula  six katun after they were destroyed they ceased to be called maya  11  ahau waslinguists refer to the maya language as yucatec or yucatec maya to distinguish it from other mayan languages  this norm has often been misinterpreted to mean that the people are also called yucatec maya  that term refers only to the language  and the correct name for the people is simply maya  not mayans   maya is one language in the mayan language family  thus  to refer to maya as mayans would be similar to referring to spanish people as romantics because they speak a language belonging to the romance language confusion of the term maya mayan as an ethnic label occurs because maya women who use traditional dress identify by the ethnic term mestiza and not use a strategy of ethnic identification that juan castillo cocom refers to as  ethnoexodus —meaning that ethnic self-identification  as maya is quite variable  situational  and articulated not to processes of producing group identity  but of escaping from discriminatory processes of sociocultural yucatán s indigenous population was first exposed to europeans after a party of spanish shipwreck survivors came ashore in 1511.  one of the sailors  gonzalo guerrero  is reported to have taken up with a local woman and started a family  he became a counselor among a local polity near present-day  chetumal  later spanish expeditions to the region were led by córdoba in 1517,  grijalva in 1518,  and cortés in 1519.  from 1528  to 1540,  several attempts by francisco montejo to conquer the yucatán failed  his son  francisco de montejo the younger  fared almost as badly when he first took over  while desperately holding out at chichen itza  he lost 150  men in a single european diseases  massive recruitment of native warriors from campeche and champoton  and internal hatred between the xiu maya and the lords of cocom eventually turned the tide for montejo the younger  chichen itza was conquered by in 1542,  the western yucatán peninsula also surrendered to him historically  the population in the eastern half of the peninsula was less affected by and less integrated with hispanic culture than the western half  in the 21st  century in the yucatán peninsula  mexican states of campeche  yucatán and quintana roo   between 750,000  and 1,200,000  people speak mayan  however  three times more than that are of maya origins  hold ancient maya surnames  and do not speak mayan languages as their first language matthew restall  in his book the maya mentions a series of letters sent to the king of spain in the 16th  and 17th  centuries  the noble maya families at that time signed documents to the spanish royal family  surnames mentioned in those letters are pech  camal  xiu  ucan  canul  cocom  and tun  among others a large 19th-century  revolt by the native maya people of yucatán  mexico   known as the caste war of yucatán  was one of the most successful modern native american for a period the maya state of chan santa cruz was recognized as an independent nation by the british empire  particularly in terms of trading with british honduras francisco luna-kan  was elected governor of the state of yucatán from 1976  to 1982.  luna-kan  was born in mérida  yucatán  and he was a doctor of medicine  then a professor of medicine before his political offices  he was first appointed as overseer of the state s rural medical system  he was the first governor of the modern yucatán peninsula to be of full maya ancestry  in the early 21st  century  dozens of politicians  including deputies  majors and senators  are of full or mixed maya heritage from the yucatán peninsula according to the national institute of geography and informatics  mexico s inegi   in yucatán state there were 1.2  million mayan speakers in 2009,  representing 59.5%  of the due to this  the

regions of mexico that was least touched by the reforms of the mexican revolution  the zapatista army of national liberation  launched a rebellion against the mexican state  chiapas in january 1994,  declared itself to be an indigenous movement and drew its strongest and earliest support from chiapan maya  today its number of supporters is relevant   see also the ezln and the chiapas conflict maya groups in chiapas include the tzotzil and tzeltal  in the highlands of the state  the tojolabalis concentrated in the lowlands around las margaritas  and the ch ol in the jungle   see map the most traditional of maya groups are the lacandon  a small population avoiding contact with outsiders until the late 20th  century by living in small groups in the lacandon jungle  these lacandon maya came from the campeche petén area (north-east  of chiapas  and moved into the lacandon rain-forest  at the end of the 18th  century in the course of the 20th  century  and increasingly in the 1950s  and 1960s,  other people  mainly the maya and subsistence peasants from the highlands   also entered into the lacandon region  initially encouraged by the government  this immigration led to land-related  conflicts and an increasing pressure on the rainforest  to halt the migration  the government decided in 1971  to declare a large part of the forest (614,000  hectares  or 6140  km2)  a protected area  the montes azules biosphere reserve  they appointed only one small population group  the 66  lacandon families  as tenants  thus creating the lacandon community   thereby displacing 2000  tzeltal and ch ol families from 26  communities  and leaving non-lacandon  communities dependent on the government for granting their rights to land  in the decades that followed the government carried out numerous programs to keep the problems in the region under control  using land distribution as a political tool  as a way of ensuring loyalty from different campesino groups  this strategy of divide and rule led to great disaffection and tensions among population groups in the region   see also the chiapas conflict and the lacandon jungle  the maya population in belize is concentrated in the corozal  cayo  toledo and orange walk districts  but they are scattered throughout the country  the maya are thought to have been in belize and the yucatán region since the second millennium bc  much of belize s original maya population died as a result of new infectious diseases and conflicts between tribes and with europeans  they are divided into the yucatec  kekchi  and mopan  these three maya groups now inhabit the country the yucatec maya  many of whom came from yucatán  mexico to escape the caste war of the 1840s)  there have been evidence of several yucatec maya groups living by the yalbac area of belize and in the orange walk district near the present day lamanai at the time the british reach  the mopan  indigenous to belize but were forced out by the british  they returned from guatemala to evade slavery in the 19th  century   and kek chi  also fled from slavery in guatemala in the 19th  century   the later groups are chiefly found in the toledo mexican state of tabasco is home to the chontal maya in guatemala  indigenous people of maya descent comprise around 40%  of the the largest and most traditional maya populations are in the western highlands in the departments

succeeding centuries a series of land displacements  re-settlements,  persecutions and migrations resulted in a wider dispersal of q eqchi  communities  into other regions of guatemala  izabal  petén  el quiché   they are the 2nd  largest ethnic maya group in guatemala  after the k iche   and one of the largest and most widespread throughout central america in guatemala  the spanish colonial pattern of keeping the native population legally separate and subservient continued well into the 20th  needed  this resulted in many traditional customs being retained  as the only other option than traditional maya life open to most maya was entering the hispanic culture at the very bottom rung  because of this many guatemalan maya  especially women  continue to wear traditional clothing  that varies according to their specific local identity the southeastern region of guatemala  bordering with honduras  includes groups such as the ch orti   the northern lowland petén region includes the itza  whose language is near extinction but whose agro-forestry  practices  including use of dietary and medicinal plants may still tell us much about pre-colonial  management of the maya the 1980s  the indigenous maya community made up about two-thirds  of guatemala’s 10  million during his presidency (1982–1983),  efraín ríos montt instituted a campaign of state terror intended to destroy the mayas in the name of countering “communist subversion” and ridding the country of its indigenous needed in some areas  government forces killed about 40%  of the total population  the campaign destroyed at least 440  mayan villages  the army attacked inhabitants  and burned down their homes and 36  year long guatemalan civil war left more than 200,000  people dead and at least 100,000  women raped  most of the victims were january 26,  2012  former president ríos montt was formally indicted in guatemala and appeared in court for genocide and crimes against needed  for which he was

dresses  each village has its own distinctive pattern  making it possible to distinguish a person s home town  women s clothing consists of a shirt and a long skirt the maya religion is roman catholicism combined with the indigenous maya religion to form the unique syncretic religion which prevailed throughout the country and still does in the rural regions prior to 2010s  of  orthodoxing  the western rural areas by christian orthodox missionaries  beginning from negligible roots prior to 1960s,  however  protestant pentecostalism has grown to become the predominant religion of guatemala city and other urban centers  later to 2010s  that almost of all maya of several rural areas of west guatemala  living rural areas were mostly mass converted from catholicism or possibly maya religion due of various reasons to either eastern or oriental orthodoxy by late fr  andres giron and some other orthodox missionaries  and also smaller to mid-sized  towns also slowly converted as well since the unique religion is reflected in the local saint  maximón  who is associated with the subterranean force of masculine fertility and prostitution  always depicted in black  he wears a black hat and sits on a chair  often with a cigar placed in his mouth and a gun in his hand  with offerings of tobacco  alcohol  and coca-cola  at his feet  the locals know him as san simon of guatemala the popol vuh is the most significant work of guatemalan literature in the k iche  language  and one of the most important of pre-columbian  american literature  it is a compendium of maya stories and legends  aimed to preserve maya traditions  the first known version of this text dates from the 16th  century and is written in quiché transcribed in latin characters  it was translated into spanish by the dominican priest francisco ximénez in the beginning of the 18th  century  due to its combination of historical  mythical  and religious elements  it has been called the maya bible

 guatemalan writers that wrote in spanish there is an undeniable symbiotic relationship between cultural heritage  tourism  and a national identity  in the case of the maya  the many national identities have been constructed because of the growing demands placed on them by cultural tourism  by focusing on lifeways through costumes  rituals  diet  handicrafts  language  housing  or other features  the identity of the economy shifts from the sale of labor to that of the sale of tourism is now considered one of the largest scale movement of goods  services  and people in history and a significant catalyst for economic development and sociopolitical estimated that between 35  and 40  percent of tourism today is represented by cultural tourism or heritage tourism  this alternative to mass tourism offers opportunities for place-based  engagement that frames context for interaction by the lived space and everyday life of other peoples  as well as sites and objects of global historical in this production of tourism the use of historic symbols  signs  and topics form a new side that characterizes a nation and can play an active role in nation this type of tourism  people argue that ethno-commerce  may open unprecedented opportunities for creating value of various kinds  tourists travel with cultural expectations  which has created a touristic experience sometimes faced with the need to invent traditions of artificial and contrived attractions  often developed at the expense of local tradition and example of this can be seen in “mayanizing tourism on roatan island  honduras  archaeological perspectives on heritage  development  and indignity ” alejandro j  figueroa et al   combine archaeological data and ethnographic insights to explore a highly contested tourism economy in their discussion of how places on roatan island  honduras  have become increasingly “mayanized” over the past decade  as tour operators and developers continue to invent an idealized maya past for the island  non-maya  archaeological remains and cultural patrimony are constantly being threatened and destroyed  while heritage tourism provides economic opportunities for some  it can devalue contributions made by less familiar
