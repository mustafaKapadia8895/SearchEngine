 fifteen-twenty  fracture zone -  wikipediathe fifteen-twenty  or 15°20'  fracture zone  ftfz   also known as the cabo verde fracture zone  is s fracture zone located on the mid-atlantic  ridge  mar  in the central atlantic ocean between 14–16°n.  it is the current location of the migrating triple junction marking the boundaries between the north american  south american  and nubian the ftfz is roughly parallel to the north and south america—africa spreading direction and has a broad axial valley produced over the last ten million years by the northward-migrating  triple offsetting the mar by some 175  km  the ftfz is located on one of the slowest portions of the mar where the full spreading rate is 25  and south of the ftfz the axis of the mar is near-perpendicular  to the spreading direction and the spreading rate is 2.6  mm yr  the axial valley south of the ftfz is composed of short axial volcanic ridges separated by 8–18  km-long  en echelon deeps  while north of the ftfz the axial ridges are much longer and more and south of the ftfz the ocean floor is relatively smooth with long abyssal hills  probably detachment faults  aligned near-parallel  to the ridge axis  in contrast  close to the ftfz the terrain is more rugged and adorned with short  oblique fault scarps  associated with the transition between these two types of terrains  at about 15°50'n  and 14°30'n  respectively  are v-shaped,  south-propagating  structures  these transitional structures disappear away from the ridge  within the rugged terrain serpentinized peridotite and gabbro are capped with a thin layer of extrusive basalt  in the smooth areas the lithosphere is more magmatic in ftfz is flanked by two negative gravity anomalies associated with the accretion of igneous crust  the anomaly south of the ftfz is twice as large as the northern one  there are also geochemical variations across the fracture zone  on the southern side basalts are enriched morb (mid-ocean  ridge basalt  but on the northern side basalts change from enriched to depleted away from the ftfz  peridotites collected from south of the ftfz have an uncommon composition ascribed to a h2o-rich  or hot mantle surfaces known as megamullions or oceanic core complexes measure 25  km along-axis  and 10–15  km across  when found along other mid-ocean  ridges such structures occur at the inside corners of ridge discontinuities  but at the ftfz they occur on both sides of the ridge away from any non-transform  these structures and ultramafic rocks outcropping on either side of the mar  in contrast to other parts of the ridge  indicate considerably reduced magma supply near the ftfz  paradoxically  geochemical analyses of basalts near the ftfz instead suggest an enriched mantle source and the presence of a mantle models can explain these contradictions  a westward ridge jump could relocate an older megamullion on the original western flank to the opposite flank after which a new megamullion start to form on the new western flank  near the ftfz this would place the older megamullion in an outside corner while the younger develop in an inside corner  alternatively  an eastward ridge jump or migration could turn a west-dipping  detachment fault into an east-dipping  fault  which would also result in an older abandoned and a youger active megamullion  which is the case is currently not on the larger corrugated surfaces are two systems of smaller scale corrugations  one on a 1–3  km-scale,  roughly 200  m high  and another finer about 100–500  m wide  the latter occur up to 1  km from the ridge and is covered by elevated ridges running parallel to the spreading direction  about 10  m wide  hundreds of metres long  and 10  m tall  these in turn are covered with cm-scale  striations running in the same north american–south american–african triple junction is associated with the initial opening of the atlantic ocean and has had a complex tectonic history  it probably migrated from near 10°n  to its current location near the ftfz between 72.5  and 35.5  ma  both its location and that of the north america–south-american–caribbean  triple junction are debated  the initiation and evolution of triple junctions is often associated with mantle plumes  but  if this is the case near the ftfz  the limited supply of magma suggest an embryonic plume or a local  anomalous mantle composition  the relative movement between the north american and south american plates is very small  but the resulting deformation could possibly explain both off-axis  seismicity and the odd mantle 15°19′12″n  45°52′16″w﻿    ﻿15.320°n  45.871°w﻿    15.320;  -45.871
