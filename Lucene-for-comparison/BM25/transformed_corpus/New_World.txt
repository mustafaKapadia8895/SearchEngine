 new world -  wikipediathe new world is one of the names used for the majority of earth s western hemisphere  specifically the americas  including nearby islands such as those of the caribbean and bermuda  the term originated in the early 16th  century after europeans made landfall in what would later be called the americas in the age of discovery  expanding the geographical horizon of classical geographers  who had thought of the world as consisting of africa  europe  and asia  collectively now referred to as the old world  a k a  afro-eurasia).the  term was coined by florentine explorer amerigo vespucci  the americas were also referred to as the  fourth part of the terms  old world  vs   new world  are meaningful in historical context and for the purpose of distinguishing the world s major ecozones  and to classify plant and animal species that originated therein one can speak of the  new world  in a historical context  e g   when discussing the voyages of christopher columbus  the spanish conquest of yucatán and other events of the colonial period  for lack of alternatives  the term is also still useful to those discussing issues that concern the americas and the nearby oceanic islands  such as bermuda and clipperton island  collectively the term  new world  is used in a biological context  when one speaks of old world  palearctic  afrotropic  and new world species  nearctic  neotropic   biological taxonomists often attach the  new world  label to groups of species that are found exclusively in the americas  to distinguish them from their counterparts in the  old world   europe  africa and asia   e g  new world monkeys  new world vultures  new world warblers the label is also often used in agriculture  africa  asia  and europe share a common agricultural history stemming from the neolithic revolution  and the same domesticated plants and animals spread through these three continents thousands of years ago  making them largely indistinct and useful to classify together as  old world   common old world crops  e g   barley  lentils  oats  peas  rye  wheat   and domesticated animals  e g   cattle  chickens  goats  horses  pigs  sheep  did not exist in the americas until they were introduced by post-columbian  contact in the 1490s   see  columbian exchange    conversely  many common crops were originally domesticated in the americas before they spread worldwide after columbian contact  and are still often referred to as  new world crops   common beans  phaseolus   maiz  and squash – the  three sisters  – as well as the avocado  tomato  and wide varieties of capsicum  bell pepper  chili pepper  etc    and the turkey were originally domesticated by pre-columbian  peoples in mesoamerica  while agriculturalists in the andean region of south america brought forth the cassava  peanut  potato  quinoa and domesticated animals like the alpaca  guinea pig and llama  other famous new world crops include the cashew  cocoa  rubber  sunflower  tobacco  and vanilla  and fruits like the guava  papaya and pineapple  there are rare instances of overlap  e g   the calabash (bottle-gourd),  cotton  and yam  and the dog  are believed to have been domesticated separately in both the old and new world  their early forms possibly brought along by paleo-indians  from asia during the last glacial period in wine terminology   new world  has a different definition   new world wines  include not only north american and south american wines  but also those from south africa  australia  new zealand  and all other locations outside the traditional wine-growing  regions of europe  north africa and the near term  new world    mundus novus   was first coined by the florentine explorer amerigo vespucci  in a letter written to his friend and former patron lorenzo di pier francesco de  medici in the spring of 1503,  and published  in latin  in 1503–04  under the title mundus novus  vespucci s letter contains arguably the first explicit articulation in print of the hypothesis that the lands discovered by european navigators to the west were not the edges of asia  as asserted by christopher columbus  but rather an entirely different continent  a  new first approached this realization in june 1502,  during a famous chance meeting between two different expeditions at the watering stop of  bezeguiche   the bay of dakar  senegal  – his own outgoing expedition  on its way to chart the coast of newly discovered brazil  and the vanguard ships of the second portuguese india armada of pedro álvares cabral  returning home from india  having already visited the americas in prior years  vespucci probably found it difficult to reconcile what he had already seen in the west indies  with what the returning sailors told him of the east indies  vespucci wrote a preliminary letter to lorenzo  while anchored at bezeguiche  which he sent back with the portuguese fleet – at this point only expressing a certain puzzlement about his vespucci was finally convinced when he proceeded on his mapping expedition through 1501–02,  covering the huge stretch of coast of eastern brazil  after returning from brazil  in the spring of 1503,  amerigo vespucci composed the mundus novus letter in lisbon to lorenzo in florence  with its famous opening passed days i wrote very fully to you of my return from new countries  which have been found and explored with the ships  at the cost and by the command of this most serene king of portugal  and it is lawful to call it a new world  because none of these countries were known to our ancestors and all who hear about them they will be entirely new  for the opinion of the ancients was  that the greater part of the world beyond the equinoctial line to the south was not land  but only sea  which they have called the atlantic  and even if they have affirmed that any continent is there  they have given many reasons for denying it is inhabited  but this opinion is false  and entirely opposed to the truth  my last voyage has proved it  for i have found a continent in that southern part  full of animals and more populous than our europe  or asia  or africa  and even more temperate and pleasant than any other region known to us vespucci s letter was a publishing sensation in europe  immediately  and repeatedly  reprinted in several other amerigo vespucci is usually credited for coming up with the term  new world   mundus novus  for the americas in his 1503  letter  certainly giving it its popular cachet  similar terms had nonetheless been used and applied before him the venetian explorer alvise cadamosto had used the term  un altro mundo    another world   to refer to sub-saharan  africa  which he explored in 1455  and 1456  on behalf of the however  this was merely a literary flourish  not a suggestion of a new  fourth  part of the world  cadamosto was quite aware sub-saharan  africa was firmly part of the african continent the italian-born  spanish chronicler peter martyr d anghiera often shares credit with vespucci for designating the americas as a new peter martyr used the term orbe novo  literally   new globe   but often translated as  new world   in the title of his history of the discovery of the americas as a whole  which began to appear in 1511   cosmologically   orbis  as used here refers to the whole hemisphere  while  mundus  refers to the land within peter martyr had been writing and circulating private letters commenting on columbus s discoveries since 1493  and  from the start  doubted columbus s claims to have reached east asia   the indies    and consequently came up with alternative names to refer to only a few weeks after columbus s return from his first voyage  peter martyr wrote letters referring to columbus s discovered lands as the  western antipodes    antipodibus occiduis   letter of may 14,  the  new hemisphere of the earth    novo terrarum hemisphaerio   september 13,  and in a letter dated november 1,  1493,  refers to columbus as the  discoverer of the new globe    colonus ille novi orbis a year later  october 20,  1494),  peter martyr again refers to the marvels of the new globe   novo orbe   and the  western hemisphere    ab occidente columbus touched the continent of south america in his 1498  third voyage  in his own 1499  letter to the catholic monarchs of spain  reporting the results of his third voyage  columbus relates how the massive waters of the orinoco delta rushing into the gulf of paria implied that a previously unknown continent must lie behind however  bowing to the classical tripartite division of the world  columbus discards that hypothesis and proposes instead that the south american landmass is not a  fourth  continent  but rather the terrestrial paradise of biblical tradition  not a previously unknown  new  part of the world  but a land already  known   but location undiscovered  by in another letter  to the nurse of prince john  written 1500),  columbus refers to having reached a  new heavens and world    nuevo cielo e and that he had placed  another world    otro mundo   under the dominion of the kings of vespucci passage above applied the  new world  label to merely the continental landmass of south at the time  most of the continent of north america was not yet discovered  and vespucci s comments did not eliminate the possibility that the islands of the antilles discovered earlier by christopher columbus might still be the eastern edges of asia  as columbus continued to insist down to his dying a critical step in the transition was the conference of navigators  junta de navegantes  assembled by the spanish monarchs at toro in 1505,  and continued at burgos in 1508,  to digest all existing information about the indies  come to an agreement on what had really been discovered  and set out the future goals of spanish exploration  amerigo vespucci attended both conferences  and seems to have had an outsized influence on them – vespucci ended up being appointed the first piloto mayor  the chief of navigation of spain  at although the proceedings of the toro-burgos  conferences are missing  it is almost certain that vespucci articulated his recent  new world  thesis to his fellow navigators there  it was during these conferences when spanish officials seem to have finally accepted that the antilles and the known stretch of central america were definitely not the indies they had originally sought  and columbus had insisted they were  and set out the new goal for spanish explorers  to find a sea passage or strait through the americas which would permit them to sail to asia in english usage the term  new world  was problematic and only accepted relatively it became generally accepted after vespucci that columbus s discoveries were not asia but a  new world   the geographic relationship between the two continents was still that there must be a large ocean between asia and the americas was implied by the known existence of vast continuous sea along the coasts of east asia  given the size of the earth as calculated by eratosthenes this left a large space between asia and the newly discovered lands even prior to vespucci  several maps  e g  the cantino planisphere of 1502  and the canerio map of 1504,  placed a large open ocean between china on the east side of the map  and the inchoate largely water-surrounded  north american and south american discoveries on the western side of map  however  out of uncertainty  they depicted a finger of the asian land mass stretching across the top to the eastern edge of the map  suggesting it carried over into the western hemisphere  e g  the cantino planisphere denotes greenland as  punta d asia  –  edge of asia    some maps  e g  the 1506  contarini–rosselli map and the 1508  johannes ruysch map  bowing to ptolemaic authority and columbus s assertions  have the northern asian landmass stretching well into the western hemisphere and merging with known north america  labrador  newfoundland  etc    these maps place the island of japan near cuba and leave the south american continent – vespucci s  new world  proper – detached and floating below by the waldseemüller map of 1507,  which accompanied the famous cosmographiae introductio volume  which includes reprints of vespucci s letters  comes closest to modernity by placing a completely open sea  with no stretching land fingers  between asia on the eastern side and the new world  being represented two times in the same map in a different way  with and without a sea passage in the middle of what is now named central america  on the western side – which  on what is now named south america  that same map famously labels simply  america   however  martin waldseemüller s map of 1516  retreats considerably from his earlier map and back to classical authority  with the asian land mass merging into north america  which he now calls terra de cuba asie partis   and quietly drops the  america  label from south america  calling it merely terra western coast of the new world – the pacific ocean – was only discovered in 1513  by vasco núñez de balboa  but it would take a few more years – ferdinand magellan s voyage of 1519–22  – to determine that the pacific definitely formed a single large body of water separating asia from the americas  it would be several more years before the pacific coast of north america was mapped  dispelling lingering doubts  of course  until the discovery of the bering straits in the 17th  century  there was no absolute confirmation that asia and north america were not connected  and some european maps of the 16th  century still continued to hopefully depict north america connected by a land bridge to asia  e g  the 1533
