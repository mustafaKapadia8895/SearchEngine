 hurricane alex (2016)  -  wikipediahurricane alex was the first atlantic hurricane in january since hurricane alice in 1955,  and the first to form in the month since 1938.  the first tropical cyclone of the 2016  atlantic hurricane season  alex originated as an extratropical cyclone near the bahamas on january 7,  2016.  the system initially traveled northeast  passing bermuda on january 8,  before turning southeast  it subsequently deepened and acquired hurricane-force  winds by january 10.  slight weakening took place thereafter  and the system eventually turned east and northeast as it acquired tropical characteristics  on january 12,  it developed into a subtropical cyclone well south of the azores  becoming the first tropical or subtropical system during january in the north atlantic since an unnamed storm in 1978.  as it turned north-northeast,  alex transitioned into a full-fledged  tropical cyclone on january 14  and became a hurricane  the storm peaked as a category 1  on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale with maximum sustained winds of 85  mph (140  km h  and a barometric pressure of 981  mbar  hpa  28.97  inhg   after weakening slightly  alex made landfall on terceira island as a tropical storm the next day  concurrently  alex began transitioning back into an extratropical cyclone  it completed this cycle hours after moving away from the azores  the system ultimately merged with another extratropical cyclone over the labrador sea on january 17.the  hurricane prompted the issuance of hurricane and tropical storm warnings for the azores and the closure of schools and businesses  alex ultimately brought gusty winds and heavy rain to the archipelago  causing generally minor damage  one person died from a heart attack when the inclement weather prevented a helicopter from transporting them to a hospital as currently defined  the atlantic hurricane season lasts from june 1  to november 30,  the period in which tropical cyclones are most likely to develop across the basin  occasionally  systems develop outside the most frequently in may or activity in january is considered extremely rare  with only five other known instances since 1851:  an unnamed hurricane in 1938,  an unnamed tropical storm in 1951,  hurricane alice in 1954–55,  an unnamed storm in 1978,  and tropical storm zeta in since alice originated in december 1954,  alex is only the second hurricane to develop solely within january  after the 1938  when alex made landfall on terceira as a strong tropical storm this marked only the second time that an atlantic tropical cyclone has made landfall in january  with the other being hurricane alice of 1955  which made landfall on saint martin and in addition to forming well outside of hurricane season  alex developed unusually far north and east  becoming only the second hurricane to form north of 30°n  and east of to alex  hurricane pali developed over the central pacific in early january  and persisted through the formation of alex  this marked the first known occurrence of simultaneous january tropical cyclones between the two early january 2016,  a stationary front was draped across the western caribbean  a non-tropical  low developed along this boundary over northwestern cuba by january moving northeast ahead of the subtropical jet stream  the system acquired a surface vortex the following day to the northeast of the initial conditions  including strong wind shear  low sea surface temperatures  and dry inhibited formation of a tropical cyclone as the storm moved northeast toward the large system featured gale-force  winds  with maximum sustained winds of 60–65  mph (95–100  on january 8,  the system passed about 75  mi (120  km  north of bermuda  bringing strong winds and heavy rain to the on january 9,  an anomalous blocking pattern prevented the cyclone from continuing along a seasonal northeasterly track  instead  the storm turned east-southeast  into a region slightly more favorable for subtropical hurricane-force  winds developed around the core of the cyclone on january 10  as it deepened to 979  mbar  hpa  28.91  though convective activity near the center remained separated from the jet stream  the cyclone dove south-southeast  over the central atlantic around a mid-latitude  slight weakening took place on january structural changes took place on january 12:  frontal boundaries separated from the core of the cyclone  convection developed atop the circulation  and it acquired a weak warm-core.  all these factors  alongside the system being co-located  with an upper-level  low  indicated its transition into a subtropical cyclone by 18:00  utc  upon doing so  the system received the name though relatively shallow  owing to the seasonally low level of the tropopause  convection was deemed deep enough for at this time  the subtropical storm was situated 1,150  mi (1,850  km  west-southwest  of the canary the trough that previously enabled the sharp southward turn later steered alex to the east-northeast  and later operationally  alex was not classified as a subtropical storm until late on january eye feature soon appeared within a complex of several banding features  marking the 20  mi (25  km  wide feature cleared out early on january 14  and was surrounded by a ring of −75  °f (−60  °c  cloud tops  as it moved away from the upper-level  low it was previously situated under  alex acquired a deeper warm core and upper-level  outflow became established  indicating the system was becoming more despite moving over 72  °f (22  °c  waters  alex continued to deepen and transitioned into a full-fledged  tropical cyclone by 06:00  the transition was enabled by colder-than-average  upper-tropospheric  temperatures which created greater instability than would otherwise be upon transitioning into a tropical cyclone  satellite intensity estimates—using the dvorak technique—indicated alex achieved hurricane strength  soon thereafter  alex achieved its peak intensity as a tropical cyclone with winds of 85  mph (140  km h  and a barometric pressure of 981  mbar  hpa  28.97  inhg   this made it a category 1  on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind alex moved north toward the azores  decreasing sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear caused it to weaken late on january 14  and into january the hurricane s eyewall opened up and its convective structure decayed  indicating the start of its transition back into an extratropical becoming increasingly tilted with height due to alex weakened to a tropical storm before making landfall over terceira island at 13:15  utc with winds of 65  mph (100  less than five hours later  the system completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone  with its circulation becoming more elongated and the radius of maximum winds expanding furthermore  the overall structure became more  comma shaped   a feature of frontal turning northwest  the system deepened slightly to 978  mbar  hpa  28.88  inhg  as it approached greenland  hurricane-force  winds developed along the southeastern coast of greenland due to interaction with the island s mountains  rather than the result of the storm intensifying  by 06:00  utc on january 17,  the remnants of alex were absorbed by a larger extratropical low over the north precursor to alex brought gale-force  winds and heavy rain to bermuda on january 8.  gusts to 60  mph (97  km h  disrupted air travel  downed trees  and left sporadic power outages  while waves as high as 20  ft (6  m  necessitated small craft advisories for the ferry services to and from cavello bay  dockyard  belmont  hodsdon’s ferry  and lower ferry were during the three days in which the system impacted the territory  1.33  in (34  mm  of rain fell at bermuda international alex s classification as a hurricane on january 14,  the azores meteorological service issued a hurricane warning for the islands of faial  pico  são jorge  graciosa  and terceira  they also issued a tropical storm warning for são miguel and santa a red alert—the highest stage for meteorological warnings—was declared for central and eastern homeowners protected doors and windows with plywood and sandbags in anticipation of damaging winds and flooding  officials closed schools and administrative buildings for the duration of the hurricane on january sata air açores cancelled 33  domestic and international flights for the morning of january 15,  stranding more than 700  the hurricane and tropical storm warnings were discontinued after alex s passage on january first hurricane to impact the azores since hurricane gordon in 2012,  alex brought heavy rain and gusty winds to the it is the only known hurricane to track within 230  mi (370  km  of the azores outside of august and rainfall totals reached 4.04  in (103  mm  in lagoa  são and 3.71  in (94  mm  in angra do heroísmo  wind gusts exceeded 50  mph (80  km h  on santa maria island and peaked at 57  mph (92  km h  in ponta delgada  são the strong winds brought down trees  inflicted damage on some roofs  and triggered scattered power outages  additionally  minor flooding was six homes in ponta delgada sustained flood damage and another had its roof landslides occurred across parts of the central islands  though they caused only limited the overall effects of the storm were less than initially possibly due to the maximum winds being located far from the center as alex underwent extratropical the hurricane indirectly led to one death—the person suffered a heart attack unrelated to the storm—when an island health unit helicopter was unable to take off due to turbulent
