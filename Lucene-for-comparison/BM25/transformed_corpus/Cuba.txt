afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of fidel since 1965,  the state has been governed by the communist party of cuba  a point of contention during the cold war between the

vanguard communist party is enshrined in the constitution  independent observers have accused the cuban government of numerous human rights abuses  including arbitrary imprisonment culturally  cuba is considered part of latin it is a multiethnic country whose people  culture and customs derive from diverse origins  including the aboriginal taíno and ciboney peoples  the long period of spanish

receive wwf s definition of sustainable believe the name cuba comes from the taíno language  however  its exact derivation the exact meaning of the name is unclear but it may be translated either as  where fertile land is abundant  or  great place  authors who believe that christopher columbus was portuguese state that cuba was named by columbus for the town of cuba in the district of beja in the arrival of the spanish  cuba was inhabited by three distinct tribes of indigenous peoples of the americas  the taíno  an arawak people   the guanajatabey  and the ciboney people the ancestors of the ciboney migrated from the mainland of south america  with the earliest sites dated to 5,000  taíno arrived from hispanola sometime in the 3rd  century a d  when columbus arrived they were the dominant culture in cuba  having an estimated population of taíno were farmers  while the ciboney were farmers as well as fishers and hunter-gatherers.after  first landing on an island then called guanahani  bahamas  on october 12,  christopher columbus commanded his three ships  la pinta  la niña and the santa maría  to land on cuba s northeastern coast on october 28,   this was near what is now bariay  holguín province   columbus claimed the island for the new kingdom of and named it isla juana after juan  prince of 1511,  the first spanish settlement was founded by diego velázquez de cuéllar at baracoa  other towns soon followed  including san cristobal de la habana  founded in 1515,  which later became the capital  the native taíno were forced to work under the encomienda which resembled a feudal system in medieval within a century the indigenous people were virtually wiped out due to multiple factors  primarily eurasian infectious diseases  to which they had no natural resistance  immunity   aggravated by harsh conditions of the repressive colonial in 1529,  a measles outbreak in cuba killed two-thirds  of those few natives who had previously survived may 18,  1539,  conquistador hernando de soto departed from havana at the head of some 600  followers into a vast expedition through the southeastern united states  starting at la florida  in search of gold  treasure  fame and on september 1,  1548,  dr  gonzalo perez de angulo was appointed governor of cuba  he arrived in santiago  cuba on november 4,  1549  and immediately declared the liberty of all he became cuba s first permanent governor to reside in havana instead of santiago  and he built havana s first church made of after the french took havana in 1555,  the governor s son  francisco de angulo  went to developed slowly and  unlike the plantation islands of the caribbean  had a diversified agriculture  but what was most important was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the spanish colonial empire  by the mid-18th  century  its colonists held 50,000  slaves  compared to 60,000  in barbados  300,000  in virginia  both british colonies  and 450,000  in french saint-domingue,  which had large-scale  sugar cane seven years  war  which erupted in 1754  across three continents  eventually arrived in the spanish caribbean  spain s alliance with the french pitched them into direct conflict with the british  and in 1762  a british expedition of five warships and 4,000  troops set out from portsmouth to capture cuba  the british arrived on june 6,  and by august had havana under when havana surrendered  the admiral of the british fleet  george keppel  the 3rd  earl of albemarle  entered the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western part of the island  the british immediately opened up trade with their north american and caribbean colonies  causing a rapid transformation of cuban society  they imported food  horses and other goods into the city  as well as thousands of slaves from west africa to work on the under developed sugar havana  which had become the third-largest  city in the americas  was to enter an era of sustained development and increasing ties with north america during this period  the british occupation of the city proved short-lived.  pressure from london sugar merchants  fearing a decline in sugar prices  forced negotiations with the spanish over colonial territories  less than a year after britain seized havana  it signed the peace of paris together with france and spain  ending the seven years  war  the treaty gave britain florida in exchange for cuba  the french had recommended this to spain  advising that declining to give up florida could result in spain instead losing mexico and much of the south american mainland to the many in britain were disappointed  believing that florida was a poor return for cuba and britain s other gains in the war the real engine for the growth of cuba s commerce in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was the haitian revolution  when the enslaved peoples of what had been the caribbean s richest colony freed themselves through violent revolt  cuban planters perceived the region s changing circumstances with both a sense of fear and opportunity  they were afraid because of the prospect that slaves might revolt in cuba  too  and numerous prohibitions during the 1790s  on the sale of slaves in cuba that had previously been slaves in french colonies underscored this anxiety  the planters saw opportunity  however  because they thought that they could exploit the situation by transforming cuba into the slave society and sugar-producing   pearl of the antilles  that haiti had been before the as the historian ada ferrer has written   at a basic level  liberation in saint-domingue  helped entrench its denial in cuba  as slavery and colonialism collapsed in the french colony  the spanish island underwent transformations that were almost the mirror image of estimates suggest that between 1790  and 1820  some 325,000  africans were imported to cuba as slaves  which was four times the amount that had arrived between 1760  and a smaller proportion of the population of cuba was enslaved  at times slaves arose in revolt  in 1812  the aponte slave rebellion took place but it was population of cuba in 1817  was 630,980,  of which 291,021  were white  115,691  free people of color (mixed-race),  and 224,268  black this was a much higher proportion of free blacks to slaves than in virginia  for instance  or the other caribbean islands  historians such as swedish magnus mõrner  who studied slavery in latin america  found that manumissions increased when slave economies were in decline  as in 18th-century  cuba and early 19th-century  maryland of the united part due to cuban slaves working primarily in urbanized settings  by the 19th  century  there had developed the practice of coartacion  or  buying oneself out of slavery   a  uniquely cuban development   according to historian herbert s  due to a shortage of white labor  blacks dominated urban industries  to such an extent that when whites in large numbers came to cuba in the middle of the nineteenth century  they were unable to displace negro a system of diversified agriculture  with small farms and fewer slaves  served to supply the cities with produce and other the 1820s,  when the rest of spain s empire in latin america rebelled and formed independent states  cuba remained loyal  its economy was based on serving the empire  by 1860,  cuba had 213,167  free people of color  39%  of its non-white  population of by contrast  virginia with about the same number of blacks  had only 58,042  or 11%  who were free  the rest were in the antebellum years  virginia discouraged manumissions after the nat turner s slave rebellion of 1831  and strengthened restrictions against free blacks  as did other southern states  in addition  there was a high demand for slaves  and virginia planters sold many in the internal domestic slave trade  to be shipped or taken overland to the deep south  which had greatly expanded its cotton production full independence from spain was the goal of a rebellion in 1868  led by planter carlos manuel de céspedes  de céspedes  a sugar planter  freed his slaves to fight with him for an independent cuba  on december 27,  1868,  he issued a decree condemning slavery in theory but accepting it in practice and declaring free any slaves whose masters present them for military the 1868  rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the ten years  war  two thousand cuban chinese joined the rebels  chinese had been imported as indentured laborers  a monument in havana honours the

spain promising greater autonomy to cuba  in 1879–1880,  cuban patriot calixto garcía attempted to start another war known as the little war but did not receive enough slavery in cuba was abolished in

is 110,860  km2  (42,803  sq mi  including coastal and territorial waters with the entire island south of the tropic of cancer  the local climate is tropical  moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round.  the temperature is also shaped by the caribbean current  which brings in warm water from the equator  this makes the climate of cuba warmer than that of hong kong  which is at around the same latitude as cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate  in general  with local variations   there is a drier season from november to april  and a rainier season from may to october  the average temperature is 21  °c (69.8  °f  in january and 27  °c (80.6  °f  in july  the warm temperatures of the caribbean sea and the fact that cuba sits across the entrance to the gulf of mexico combine to make the country prone to frequent hurricanes  these are most common in september and october hurricane irma hit the island on september 8,  2017,  with winds of 260  kilometres per at the camagüey archipelago  the storm reached ciego de avila province around midnight and continued to pound cuba the next the worst damage was in the keys north of the main island

january 24,  revision comprises an action plan with time limits for each item  and an indication of the governmental body responsible for delivery  that document contains virtually no information about biodiversity  however  the country s fourth national report to the cbd contains a detailed breakdown of the numbers of species of each kingdom of life recorded from cuba  the main groups being  animals (17,801  species   bacteria (270),  chromista (707),  fungi  including lichen-forming  species (5844),  plants (9107)  and protozoa elsewhere in the world  vertebrate animals and flowering plants are well documented  so the recorded numbers of species are probably close to the true numbers  for most or all other groups  the true numbers of species occurring in cuba are likely to exceed  often considerably  the numbers recorded so far according to the official census of 2010,  cuba s population was 11,241,161,  comprising 5,628,996  men and 5,612,165  its birth rate (9.88  births per thousand population in is one of the lowest in the western hemisphere  although the country s population has grown by about four million people since 1961,  the rate of growth slowed during that period  and the population began to decline in 2006,  due in the country s low fertility rate (1.43  children per woman  coupled with this drop in fertility is among the largest in the western and is attributed largely to unrestricted access to legal abortion  cuba s abortion rate was 58.6  per 1000  pregnancies in 1996,  compared to an average of 35  in the caribbean  27  in latin america overall  and 48  in europe  similarly  the use of contraceptives is also widespread  estimated at 79%  of the female population  in the upper third of countries in the western population is multiethnic  reflecting its complex colonial origins  intermarriage between diverse groups is widespread  and consequently there is some discrepancy in reports of the country s racial composition  whereas the institute for cuban and cuban-american  studies at the university of miami determined that 62%  of cubans are the 2002  cuban census found that a similar proportion of the population  65.05%,  was

lineages were european (82%)  and african (18%),  indicating the historical bias towards mating between foreign men and native women rather than the contributions in cubans as inferred from autosomal

waves of canarian  catalan  andalusian  galician  and other spanish people immigrated to cuba  between 1899–1930  alone  close to a million spaniards entered the country  though many would eventually return to other prominent immigrant groups included portuguese  italian  russian  dutch  greek  british  and irish  as well as small number of descendants of u s  citizens who arrived in cuba in the late 19th  and early 20th  centuries.post-revolution  cuba has been characterized by significant levels of emigration  which has led to a large and influential diaspora community  during the three decades after january 1959,  more than one million cubans of all social classes — constituting 10%  of the total population — emigrated to the united states  a proportion that matches the extent of emigration to the u s  from the caribbean as a whole during that other common destinations include spain  the united kingdom  canada  mexico  and sweden  among others  those who left the country

respectively  and pope francis visited cuba in september prior to each papal visit  the cuban government pardoned prisoners as a humanitarian government s relaxation of restrictions on house churches
