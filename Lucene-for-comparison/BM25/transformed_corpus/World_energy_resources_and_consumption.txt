 world energy consumption -  wikipediaworld energy consumption is the total energy used by the entire human civilization  typically measured per year  it involves all energy harnessed from every energy source applied towards humanity s endeavours across every single industrial and technological sector  across every country  it does not include energy from food  and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented  being the power source metric of civilization  world energy consumption has deep implications for humanity s socio-economic-political  sphere institutions such as the international energy agency  iea   the u s  energy information administration  eia   and the european environment agency record and publish energy data periodically  improved data and understanding of world energy consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns  which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions closely related to energy consumption is the concept of total primary energy supply  tpes   which -  on a global level -  is the sum of energy production minus storage changes  since changes of energy storage over the year are minor  tpes values can be used as an estimator for energy consumption  however  tpes ignores conversion efficiency  overstating forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency  e g  coal  gas and nuclear  and understating forms already accounted for in converted forms  e g  photovoltaic or hydroelectricity   the iea estimates that  in 2013,  total primary energy supply  tpes  was 1.575  × 1017  wh    157.5  pwh  5.67  × 1020  joules  or 13,541  from 2000–2012  coal was the source of energy with the largest growth  the use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth  followed by hydropower and renewable energy  renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period  the demand for nuclear energy decreased  in part due to nuclear disasters  e g  three mile island 1979,  chernobyl 1986,  and fukushima 2011,  expenditures on energy totalled over 6  trillion usd  or about 10%  of the world gross domestic product  gdp   europe spends close to one-quarter  of the world s energy expenditures  north america close to 20%,  and japan total primary energy supply  tpes   or  primary energy  differs from the world final energy consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers  for instance  when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline  so that it can be used in a car  and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers  world final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the world s primary energy that is used in its final form by humanity in 2014,  world primary energy supply amounted to 155,481  terawatt-hour   twh  or 13,541  mtoe  while the world final energy consumption was 109,613  twh or about 29.5%  less than the total world final energy consumption includes products as lubricants  asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel  this non-energy  use amounted to 9,404  twh (809  mtoe  in the end of 2014,  the total installed global power generating capacity is nearly 6.142  tw  million mw  which does not include the dg sets not connected to local electricity in 2014,  world energy consumption for electricity generation was coal 40.8%,  natural gas 21.6%,  nuclear 10.6%,  hydro 16.4%,   others   solar  wind  geothermal  biomass  etc   6.3%  and oil 4.3%.  coal and natural gas were the most popular energy fuels for generating electricity  the world s electricity consumption was 18,608  needed  in 2012.  this figure is about 18%  smaller than the generated electricity  due to grid losses  storage losses  and self-consumption  from power plants  gross generation   cogeneration  chp  power stations use some of the energy that is otherwise wasted for heating buildings or in industrial processes.2014  world electricity generation (23,816  twh  by source  iea  united states energy information administration regularly publishes a report on world consumption for most types of primary energy resources  for 2013,  estimated world energy consumption was 5.67  × 1020  joules  or 157,481  twh  according to the iea the total world energy consumption was 143,851  twh in 2008,  133,602  twh in 2005,  117,687  twh in 2000,  and 102,569  twh in 1990.  total world electricity consumption was 19,504  twh in 2013,  16,503  twh in 2008,  15,105  twh in 2005,  and 12,116  twh in in 2012  approximately 22%  of world energy was consumed in north america  5%  was consumed south and central america  23%  was consumed in europe and eurasia  3%  was consumed in africa  and 40%  was consumed in the asia pacific there has been a large increase in international agreements and national energy action plans  such as the eu 2009  renewable energy directive  to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as oil  coal  and natural one such initiative was the united nations development programme s world energy assessment in 2000  that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy from 2000–2012  renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history  with a consumption increase of 176.5  million tonnes of oil  during this period  oil  coal  and natural gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy  the following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as oil  coal  and natural gas as well as renewable sources of energy during this energy consumption growth in the g20  slowed down to 2%  in 2011,  after the strong increase of 2010.  the economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth  for several years now  the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish chinese and indian markets  while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies  high oil prices  resulting in stable or decreasing energy to iea data from 1990  to 2008,  the average energy use per person increased 10%  while world population increased 27%.  regional energy use also grew from 1990  to 2008:  the middle east increased by 170%,  china by 146%,  india by 91%,  africa by 70%,  latin america by 66%,  the usa by 20%,  the eu-27  block by 7%,  and world overall grew by 39%.in  2008,  total worldwide primary energy consumption was 132,000  terawatt-hours   twh  or 474  exajoules in 2012,  primary energy demand increased to 158,000  twh (567  consumption in the g20  increased by more than 5%  in 2010  after a slight decline of 2009.  in 2009,  world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30  years by 1.1%,  or about 130  million tonnes of oil equivalent  mtoe   as a result of the financial and economic crisis  which reduced world gdp by 0.6%  in evolution is the result of two contrasting trends  energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries  specifically in asia (+4%).  conversely  in oecd  consumption was severely cut by 4.7%  in 2009  and was thus almost down to its 2000  levels  in north america  europe and the cis  consumptions shrank by 4.5%,  5%  and 8.5%  respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity  china became the world s largest energy consumer (18%  of the total  since its consumption surged by 8%  during 2009   up from 4%  in 2008).  oil remained the largest energy source (33%)  despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time  coal posted a growing role in the world s energy consumption  in 2009,  it accounted for 27%  of the total most energy is used in the country of origin  since it is cheaper to transport final products than raw materials  in 2008,  the share export of the total energy production by fuel was  oil 50%  (1,952/3,941  mt   gas 25%  (800/3,149  bcm  and hard coal 14%  (793/5,845  of the world s high energy resources are from the conversion of the sun s rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet  some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy  some is directly or indirectly usable  for example  via solar pv thermal  wind  hydro-  or wave power  the total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361  watts per square meter  see solar constant   though it fluctuates by about 6.9%  during the year due to the earth s varying distance from the sun  this value  after multiplication by the cross-sectional  area intercepted by the earth  is the total rate of solar energy received by the planet  about half  89,000  tw  reaches the earth s estimates of remaining non-renewable  worldwide energy resources vary  with the remaining fossil fuels totaling an estimated 0.4  yottajoule  yj  or 4  × 1023  joules  and the available nuclear fuel such as uranium exceeding 2.5  yj  fossil fuels range from 0.6  to 3  yj if estimates of reserves of methane clathrates are accurate and become technically extractable  the total power flux from the sun intercepting the earth is 5.5  yj per year  though not all of this is available for human consumption  the iea estimates for the world to meet global energy demand for the two decades from 2015  to 2035  it will require investment of $48  trillion and  credible policy to iea (2012)  the goal of limiting warming to 2  °c is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes  if action is not taken before 2017,  co2  emissions would be locked-in  by energy infrastructure existing in 2017.  fossil fuels are dominant in the global energy mix  supported by $523  billion subsidies in 2011,  up almost 30%  on 2010  and six times more than subsidies to warming emissions resulting from energy production are an environmental problem  efforts to resolve this include the kyoto protocol  which is a un agreement aiming to reduce harmful climate impacts  which a number of nations have signed  limiting global temperature increase to 2  degrees celsius  thought to be a risk by the sei  is now doubtful to limit global temperature to a hypothetical 2  degrees celsius rise would demand a 75%  decline in carbon emissions in industrial countries by 2050,  if the population is 10  billion in across 40  years  this averages to a 2%  decrease every year  in 2011,  the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem  hypothetically  according to robert engelman  worldwatch institute   in order to prevent collapse  human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population gases are not the only emissions of energy production and consumption  large amounts of pollutants such as sulphurous oxides  sox   nitrous oxides  nox   and particulate matter  pm  are produced from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass  the world health organisation estimates that 7  million premature deaths are caused each year by air biomass combustion is a major in addition to producing air pollution like fossil fuel combustion  most biomass has high co2  primary energy supply of 13,699  mega-toe  by source in 2014   iea  twentieth century saw a rapid twenty-fold  increase in the use of fossil fuels  between 1980  and 2006,  the worldwide annual growth rate was according to the us energy information administration s 2006  estimate  the estimated 471.8  ej total consumption in 2004,  was divided as given in the table above  with fossil fuels supplying 86%  of the world s energy in 2000,  china accounted for 28%  of world coal consumption  other asia consumed 19%,  north america 25%  and the eu 14%.  the single greatest coal-consuming  country is china  its share of the world coal production was 28%  in 2000  and rose to 48%  in 2009.  in contrast to china s ~70%  increase in coal consumption  world coal use increased 48%  from 2000  to 2009.  in practice  the majority of this growth occurred in china and the rest in other china s energy consumption is mostly driven by the industry sector  the majority of which comes from coal annual coal production increased 1,905  mt or 32%  in 6  years in 2011  compared to 2005,  of which over 70%  was in china and 8%  in india  coal production was in 2011  7,783  mt  and 2009  6,903  mt  equal to 12.7%  production increase in two production and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008,  proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150  years  this is much more than needed for an irreversible climate catastrophe  coal is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the world  according to james hansen the single most important action needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce co2  emissions from indonesia and australia exported together 57.1%  of the world coal export in 2011.  china  japan  south korea  india and taiwan had 65%  share of all the world coal import in fueled the industrial revolution in the 18th  and 19th  century  with the advent of the automobile  aeroplanes and the spreading use of electricity  oil became the dominant fuel during the twentieth century  the growth of oil as the largest fossil fuel was further enabled by steadily dropping prices from 1920  until 1973.  after the oil shocks of 1973  and 1979,  during which the price of oil increased from 5  to 45  us dollars per barrel  there was a shift away from coal  natural gas  and nuclear became the fuels of choice for electricity generation and conservation measures increased energy efficiency  in the u s  the average car more than doubled the number of miles per gallon  japan  which bore the brunt of the oil shocks  made spectacular improvements and now has the highest energy efficiency in the from 1965  to 2008,  the use of fossil fuels has continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased  from 2003  to 2008,  coal was the fastest growing fossil is estimated that between 100  and 135  billion tonnes of oil has been consumed between 1850  and the 2009,  the world use of natural gas grew 31%  compared to 2000.  66%  of this growth was outside eu  north america  latin america  and russia  others include the middle east  asia  and africa  the gas supply increased also in the previous regions  8.6%  in the eu and 16%  in the north america of 1  july 2016,  the world had 444  operable grid-electric  nuclear power reactors with 62  others under since commercial nuclear energy began in the mid 1950s,  2008  was the first year that no new nuclear power plant was connected to the grid  although two were connected in generation of nuclear power has been on a slight downward trend since 2007,  decreasing 1.8%  in 2009  to 2558  twh  and another 1.6%  in 2011  to 2518  twh  despite increases in production from most countries worldwide  because those increases were more than offset by decreases in germany and japan  nuclear power met 11.7%  of the world s electricity demand in 2011.  source  energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources that are not significantly depleted by their use  such as sunlight  wind  rain  tides  waves and geothermal renewable energy is gradually replacing conventional fuels in four distinct areas  electricity generation  hot water space heating  motor fuels  and rural (off-grid)  energy on ren21's  2014  report  renewables contributed 19  percent to our energy consumption and 22  percent to our electricity generation in 2012  and 2013,  respectively  this energy consumption is divided as 9%  coming from traditional biomass  4.2%  as heat energy (non-biomass),  3.8%  hydro electricity and 2%  electricity from wind  solar  geothermal  and biomass  worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than us$214  billion in 2013,  with countries like china and the united states heavily investing in wind  hydro  solar and renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas  in contrast to other energy sources  which are concentrated in a limited number of countries  rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security  climate change

ever-evolving  technologies  solar energy technologies include solar heating  solar photovoltaics  concentrated solar power and solar architecture  which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces  the international energy agency projected that solar power could provide  a third of the global final energy demand after 2060,  while co2  emissions would be reduced to very low solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture  convert and distribute solar energy  active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy  passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the sun  selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties  and designing spaces that naturally circulate air  from 2012  to 2016  solar capacity tripled and now provides 1.3%  of global
