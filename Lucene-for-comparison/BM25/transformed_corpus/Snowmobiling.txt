 snowmobile -  wikipediaa snowmobile  also known as a snowmachine  is a vehicle designed for winter travel and recreation on snow  it is designed to be operated on snow and ice and does not require a road or trail but most are driven on open terrain or trails  snowmobiling is a sport that many people have taken on as a serious hobby older snowmobiles could generally accommodate two people  however  most snowmobiles manufactured in the last twenty-five  years have been designed for a single rider  snowmobiles built with the ability to carry two riders are referred to as "2-up"  snowmobiles or  touring  models and make up an extremely small share of the market  snowmobiles do not have any enclosures  except for a windshield  and their engines normally drive a continuous track at the rear  skis at the front provide directional control early snowmobiles used rubber tracks  but modern snowmobiles  tracks are typically made of a kevlar composite  originally  snowmobiles were powered by two-stroke  gasoline internal combustion engines and since the mid-2000s  four-stroke  engines have also entered the market the second half of the 20th  century saw the rise of recreational snowmobiling  whose riders are called snowmobilers or sledders  recreational riding is known as snowcross racing  trail riding  freestyle  mountain climbing  boondocking  carving  ditchbanging and grass drags  in the summertime snowmobilers can drag race on grass  asphalt strips  or even across water  see snowmobile skipping   snowmobiles are sometimes modified to compete in long-distance  off-road  races such as trevor erickson s #901  entry in the 2014  vegas to reno race  see  snowmobile to reno  in 1911  a 24  year old  harold j  kalenze  pronounced collins  patent the vehicle propeller in brandon  manitoba  1915  ray h  muscott of waters  michigan  received the canadian patent for his motor sleigh  or  traineau automobile   and on june 27,  1916,  he received the first united states patent for a snow-vehicle  using the now recognized format of rear track s  and front many individuals later modified ford model ts with the undercarriage replaced by tracks and skis following this design  they were popular for rural mail delivery for a time  the common name for these conversion of cars and small trucks was challenges of cross-country  transportation in the winter led to the invention of the snowmobile  an all-terrain  vehicle specifically designed for travel across deep snow where other vehicles during the 20th  century  rapidly evolving designs produced machines that were two-person  tracked vehicles powered by gas engines that enabled them to tow a sled or travel  initially at low-to-moderate  speeds  depending on snow conditions  terrain and obstacles protruding above the snow like brush and trees  where early designs had 10  horsepower (7.5  kw  two-stroke  engines  there has been a move toward newer style 2-stroke  and 4-stroke  gasoline engines  some with over 200  hp (150  kw  the origin of the snowmobile  or sled  as they are often referred is not the work of any one inventor but more a process of advances in engines for the propulsion of vehicles and supporting devices over snow  it parallels the development of the automobile and later aviation  often inventors using the same components for a different needed wisconsinites experimented with over-snow  vehicles before 1900,  experimenting with bicycles equipped with runners and gripping fins  steam-propelled  sleighs  and  later  model t fords converted with rear tractor treads and skis in front  a patent (554.482)  for the sled-propeller  design  without a model  was submitted on sept  5,  1895  by inventors william j  culman and william b  follis of brule  in the first races held near three lakes in 1926,  104  of these  snowbuggies  started  carl eliason of sayner developed the prototype of the modern snowmobile in the 1920s  when he mounted a two-cylinder  motorcycle engine on a long sled  steered it with skis under the front  and propelled it with single  endless eliason made 40  snowmobiles  patented in upon receiving an order for 200  from finland  he sold his patent to the fwd company of clintonville  they made 300  for military use  then transferred the patent to a canadian subsidiary the american motor sleigh was a short-lived  novelty vehicle produced in boston in 1905.  designed for travel on snow  it consisted of a sleigh body mounted on a framework that held an engine  a drive-shaft  system  and although considered an interesting novelty  sales were low and production ceased in aerosani  propeller-driven  and running on skis  was built in 1909–1910  by russian inventor igor sikorsky of helicopter aerosanis were used by the soviet red army during the winter war and world war there is some dispute over whether aerosanis count as snowmobiles because they were not propelled by kégresse designed an original caterpillar tracks system  called the kégresse track  while working for tsar nicholas ii of russia between 1906  and 1916.  these used a flexible belt rather than interlocking metal segments and could be fitted to a conventional car or truck to turn it into a half-track,  suitable for use over soft ground  including snow  conventional front wheels and steering were used but the wheel could be fitted with skis as seen in the upper right image  he applied it to several cars in the royal garage including rolls-royce  cars and packard trucks  although this was not a snowmobile  it is an ancestor of the modern concept the relatively dry snow conditions of the united states midwest suited the converted ford model ts and other like vehicles  but they were not suitable for humid snow areas such as southern quebec and new england  this led joseph-armand  bombardier from the small town of valcourt  quebec  to invent a different caterpillar track system suitable for all kinds of snow conditions  bombardier had already made some  metal  tracked vehicles since 1928,  but his new revolutionary track traction system  a toothed wheel covered in rubber  and a rubber-and-cotton  track that wraps around the back wheels  was his first major invention  he started production of the b-7,  an enclosed  seven-passenger  snowmobile  in 1937,  and introduced the b-12,  a twelve-passenger  model  in 1942.  the b-7  had a v-8  flathead engine from ford motor company  the b-12  had a flathead in line six-cylinder  engine from chrysler industrial  and 2,817  units were produced until 1951.  it was used in many applications  such as ambulances  canada post vehicles  winter  school buses   forestry machines  and even army vehicles in world war ii  bombardier had always dreamed of a smaller version  more like the size of a motor scooter numerous people had ideas for a smaller personal snowmobile  in 1914,  o  m  erickson and art olsen of the p n  bushnell company in aberdeen  south dakota  built an open two-seater  "motor-bob"  out of an indian motorcycle modified with a cowl-cover,  side-by-side  seating  and a set of sled-runners  fore and aft  while it did not have the tracks of a true snowmobile  its appearance was otherwise similar to the modern version and is one of the earliest examples of a personal motorized 1951  dr  fritz riemerschmid devised what he called a snow scooter  the machine had a track mounted beneath a snowboard like base  on top of which were an enclosed engine with motorcycle like seat and fuel tank  the vehicle was steered via a steering wheel and cables linked to two small skis on outriggers either side of the the mid-1950s,  a united states firm built a  snowmobile the arctic area of alaska that had the drive train reversed of today s snowmobiles with two front wheels—the larger one behind the smaller one—with tires driving an endless loop track   little is known about this  snowmobile  meant to haul cargo and trade goods to isolated and allen hetteen and david johnson of roseau  minnesota  were among the first to build a practical snowmobile in 1955–1956,  but the early machines were heavy (1,000  lb or 450  kg  and slow (20  mph or 32  km h   their company  hetteen hoist   derrick co   became polaris was only in 1960,  when engines became lighter and smaller than before  that joseph-armand  bombardier invented what we now know as the modern snowmobile in its open-cockpit  one-  or two-person  form  and started selling it under the brand name ski-doo  through his company bombardier inc   now manufactured by bombardier recreational products  competitors copied and improved his design  in the 1970s  there were over a hundred snowmobile from 1970  to 1973,  two million machines were sold  peaking at 500,000  sold in many of the snowmobile companies were small and the biggest manufacturers were often attempts by motorcycle makers and outboard motor makers to branch off in a new market  most of these companies went bankrupt or were acquired by larger companies during the 1973  oil crisis and succeeding recessions  sales rebounded to 260,000  in 1997  but gradually decreased afterwards  influenced by warmer winters and the use during all four seasons of small one-  or two-person  atvs alpina snowmobiles are manufactured in vicenza  italy  by alpina s r l   a manufacturer of various on-snow  implements that had been building dual-track  snowmobiles since are two manufacturers of dual-track  snowmobiles  one is alpina and the other is a russian sled called buran  bombardier discontinued manufacturing its dual-track  model  the elite  in needed alpina manufactures one basic dual-track  snowmobile design  in 2002  the sherpa was introduced and is the model name for the four-stroke  machine  prior to introducing the sherpa  alpina offered a 2-stroke  series designated the superclass  the four-stroke  sherpa is currently the top machine in production  a new version of the superclass has been released in 2017,  with a lot of innovations and a new 4-stroke  engine the sherpa and superclass series shared the same basic dual-track  platform  twin 20  in × 156  in (510  mm × 3,960  mm  tracks with dual skis up front power for the sherpa is supplied by a 1.6l  in-line  four-cylinder  gasoline automotive engine  the new superclass power is provided by a 1.2l  3-cylinder  4-stroke  gasoline engine the sherpa and superclass are designed as working snowmobiles for carrying supplies  pulling cargo sleds  pulling trail grooming implements  carrying several passengers  and negotiating deep snow engine and transmission combination are designed to deliver optimum power to pull or carry large loads while top-end  speeds are kept below 52  mph (84  km h   depending on the model  the large footprint of the dual tracks and dual skis allows the sherpa and superclass to  float  on top of deep snow and not sink in and get stuck as of the snowmobile market has been shared between the four large north american makers  bombardier recreational products  brp   arctic cat  yamaha  and polaris  and some specialized makers like the quebec-based  ad boivin  manufacturer of the snow and the european alpina modern snowmobiles can achieve speeds in excess of 150  mph (240  km h   drag racing snowmobiles can reach speeds in excess of 200  mph (320  km h  snowmobiles are widely used in arctic territories for travel  however  the small arctic population means a correspondingly small market  most snowmobiles are sold for recreational purposes  in places where snow cover is stable during winter  the number of snowmobiles in europe and other parts of the world is low  but growing snowmobiles designed to perform various work tasks have been available for many years with dual tracks from such manufacturers as aktiv  sweden   who made the grizzly  ockelbo  sweden   who made the 8000,  and bombardier who made the alpine and later the alpine ii  currently there are two manufacturers of dual-track  snowmobiles  russia s needed  and the italian alpina snowmobiles  under the name sherpa and superclass  an odd version of snowmobile is the swedish larven  made by the lenko company of östersund  from the 1960s  until the end of the 1980s.  it was a very small and basic design  with just an engine in the rear and a track  the driver sat on it and steered using skis on his modern snowmobiles are powered by either a four-  or two-stroke  internal combustion engine  historically  snowmobiles have always used two-stroke  engines because of their reduced complexity  weight and cost  compared to a similarly powered four-stroke.  however  four-stroke  powered snowmobiles have been gaining popularity steadily in the last fifteen or so years  with manufacturer yamaha producing four-stroke  snowmobiles only  the whistler blackcomb ski resort is testing electric snowmobiles with lower noise and shorter and similar vehicles first snowmobiles made do with as little as 5  horsepower (3.7  kw  engines  but engine sizes and efficiency have improved drastically  in the early 1990s,  the biggest engines available  typically 600-650cc  range  produced around 115  hp (86  kw   as of 2010,  several snowmobiles are available with engines sizes up to 1,200  cc  producing 150+  hp  as well as several models with up to 1,000  cc engines producing closer to 180  hp (130  kw   recently  some models are turbo-charged,  resulting in dramatic increase of engine horsepower  snowmobiles are capable of moving across steep hillsides without sliding down-slope  if the rider transfers their weight towards the uphill side  a process called side-hilling.mountain  sleds permit access in remote areas with deep snow  which was nearly impossible a few decades ago  this is mainly due to alterations  enhancements  and additions of original trail model designs such as weight  weight distribution  track length  paddle depth  and power  technology and design advances in mountain snowmobiles have improved since 2003  with ski-doo's  introduction of the  rev  framework platform  most 2-stroke  mountain snowmobiles have a top engine size of 800  cc  producing around 150  hp (110  kw   although some 1,000  cc factory machines have been produced  these may not be as popular as many 800  cc models outperform them because of weight and an increase of unneeded power cornices and other kinds of jumps are sought after for aerial maneuvers  riders often search for non-tracked,  virgin terrain and are known to  trailblaze  or  boondock  deep into remote territory where there is absolutely no visible path to follow  however  this type of trailblazing is dangerous as contact with buried rocks  logs  and frozen ground can cause extensive damage and injuries  riders look for large open fields of fresh snow where they can carve  some riders use extensively modified snowmobiles  customized with aftermarket accessories like handle-bar  risers  handguards  custom lightweight hoods  windshields  and seats  running board supports  studs  and numerous other modifications that increase power and maneuverability  many of these customizations can now be purchased straight off the showroom floor on stock models trail snowmobiles improved in the past 15  as well  many of them borrowed from endeavors to produce winning mountain sleds   heavy  muscle sleds  can produce speeds in excess of 100  mph (160  km h  due to powerful engines  up to 1,200  cc stock  and custom engines exceeding 1,200  cc   short tracks  and good traction on groomed trails  sno-cross  oriented snowmobiles often have an engine size cap of 440  or 600  cc  but lighter machines with redesigned stances  formats  and weight control have produced extremely fast and quickly accelerating race sleds the environmental impact of snowmobiles has been the subject of much debate  governments have been reacting slowly to noise and air pollution  partly because of lobbying from manufacturers and snowmobilers  for instance  in 1999,  the canadian government adopted the canadian environmental protection act  1999,  but the set of rules governing pollution emissions for off-road  vehicles was only released in january in another example of regulation  only four-stroke  snowmobiles are allowed in yellowstone national park since a bylaw was recently passed to minimize co2  emissions and in yellowstone  snowmobiles account for 80%  of total hydrocarbon emissions and 50%  of carbon monoxide emissions in the winter  this is just less than 2%  and 1%  respectively of the overall annual pollution within the park  snowmobiles are only allowed to be ridden on the unplowed roads used in the summer  and riding off the roads is prohibited  this accounts for less than 1%  (0.002%)  of the park area most snowmobiles are still powered by two-stroke  engines  although alpina and yamaha have been using four-strokes  since 2002  and 2003,  respectively  however  in the last decade several manufacturers have been successful in designing less polluting motors  and putting most of them in production  yamaha and arctic-cat  were the first to mass-produce  four-stroke  models  which are significantly less polluting than the early two-stroke  machines  alpina offers only 4-stroke  efi engines equipped with a catalytic converter and dual oxygen-probe.  bombardier s e-tec  two-stroke  motors emit 85%  less pollutants than previous carbureted 2-strokes.  polaris has developed a fuel-injection  technology called  cleanfire injection  on their 2  strokes  the industry is also working on a direct-injected   clean two strokes  that is better in terms of nox emissions independent researchers  undergraduates and graduate students participate in contests to lessen the impact of emissions from snowmobiles  the clean snow mobile challenge is held yearly at michigan technological university regrouping the entries from universities from across united states and some of the participants in recent years have been the école polytechnique de montréal with a quasiturbine and students from école de technologie supérieure of the uqam with a less polluting two-stroke  engine using e85  and direct noise restrictions have been enacted by law for both production of snowmobiles and aftermarket components  for instance  in quebec  canada  noise levels must be 78  decibels or less at 20  meters from a snowmobile as of 2009,  snowmobiles produce 90%  less noise than in the but there are still numerous efforts to reduce noise focus on suppressing mechanical noise of the suspension components and arctic cat in 2005  introduced  silent track technology  on touring models such as the t660  turbo  bearcat  and some m-series  sleds  ski-doo  has since then also used comparative  silent track technology  on some models the use of aftermarket exhaust systems   cans  or  silencers   is controversial  these replace the stock muffler with a less restrictive system that is usually claimed to increase power output of the engine  however  these aftermarket exhausts are often much louder than those from the factory  with only some being slightly quieter than a completely open  unbaffled system  most  if not all  local snowmobile clubs  that maintain and groom trail systems  do not recommend them because of noise  local and state authorities have set up checkpoints on high-traffic  trails  checking for excessively loud systems and issuing citations  typically these systems are installed on 2-stroke  powered machines  giving the distinctive  braap  sound   however  in recent years aftermarket companies have released silencers for 4-stroke  models as well since the invention of snowmobiles  isolated communities of northern north america have always had a demand for them  however  the early snowmobiles designs were not economical or functional enough for the harsh environment of northern north america  joseph-armand  bombardier started producing the ski-doo  in 1959  at the request of a the priest had asked bombardier to make an economical and reliable means of winter the ski-doo  greatly changed life in northern north america s isolated communities  where ski-doo  replaced sled dogs by the end of the the ski-doo  also greatly improved communication between isolated snowmobiles are also called  snow machines” in some areas of alaska in northern north america  historically  isolated communities depended on dog sledding and snowshoeing as their primary method of transportation for hunting during the winter months  the ski-doo  allowed trappers to travel greater distances faster  allowing them to expand their hunting prospectors  mining companies  foresters  backcountry cabin owners  the royal canadian mounted police and canadian army also found snowmobiles very effective because they were the most economical method of transportation of small bombardier’s tests of ski-dog  proved that snowmobiling was fun  and snowmobiling became a new form of outdoor people who once sat dormant throughout winter were now given the opportunity in more outdoor to the international snowmobile manufacturers association  snowmobilers in canada and the united states spend over $28  billion on snowmobiling each year  this includes expenditures on equipment  clothing  accessories  snowmobiling vacations  lodging  fuel  and food   maintenance and others  often this is the only source of income for some smaller towns  such as bralorne  british columbia  that rely solely on tourism during the summer and winter once a booming gold mining town  bralorne is now a very small town with a population of and it is relatively inaccessible by car in the the economy relies on visits from snowmobilers  who contribute to the economy by spending money on gas  food  and a result of their inherent maneuverability  acceleration  and high-speed  abilities  both skill and physical strength are required to operate a snowmobile snowmobile injuries and fatalities are high compared to those caused by on road motor vehicle losing control of a snowmobile could easily cause extensive damage  injury  or death  one such cause of snowmobile accidents is loss of control from a loose grip  if the rider falls off  the loss of control can easily result in the snowmobile colliding with a nearby object  such as a rock or tree  most snowmobiles are fitted with a cord connected to a kill switch  which would stop the snowmobile if the rider falls off  however  not all riders use this device every time they operate a snowmobile swerving off of the path may result in rolling the snowmobile or crashing into an obstacle  in unfamiliar areas  riders may crash into suspended barbed wire or haywire fences at high speeds  each year a number of serious fatal accidents have been caused by these factors each year  riders are killed by hitting other snowmobiles  automobiles  pedestrians  rocks  trees  or fences  or falling through thin ice  on average  10  people a year have died in such crashes in minnesota alone  with alcohol a contributing factor in many needed  in saskatchewan  16  out of 21  deaths in snowmobile collisions between 1996  and 2000  were caused by the effects of wrestler lindsey durlacher died in 2011  following surgery for a broken sternum he sustained in a snowmobile collisions with trains can also occur when a snowmobile operator engages in the illegal practice of  rail riding   riding between railroad track rails over snow-covered  sleepers  inability to hear the sound of an oncoming train over the engine noise of a snowmobile makes this activity extremely dangerous  collision with large animals such as moose and deer  which may venture onto a snowmobile trail  is another major cause of snowmobile accidents  most often such encounters occur at night or in low-visibility  conditions when the animal could not be seen in time to prevent a collision  also even when successful  a sudden maneuver to miss hitting the animal could still result in the operator losing control of the snowmobile a large number of snowmobile deaths in alaska are caused by drowning  because of the cold weather in many parts of alaska  the rivers and lakes are generally frozen over during certain times of the year in winter  people who ride early or late in the season run the risk of falling through weak ice  and heavy winter clothing can make it extremely difficult to escape the frozen water  while a snowmobile is heavy  it also distributes its weight at a larger area than a standing person  so a driver who has stopped his vehicle out on the ice of a frozen lake can go through the ice just by stepping off the needed  the next leading cause of injury and death is avalanches  which can result from the practice of highmarking  or driving a snowmobile as far up a hill as it can can be reduced through education  proper training  appropriate gear and attention to published avalanche warnings  in some areas of western u s   organizations provide avalanche training  some of which is free  it is recommended that snowmobile riders wear a helmet and a snowmobile suit
