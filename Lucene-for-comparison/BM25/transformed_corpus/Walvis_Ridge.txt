 walvis ridge -  wikipediathe walvis ridge  walvis means whale in dutch and afrikaans  is an aseismic ocean ridge in the southern atlantic ocean  more than 3,000  km (1,900  mi  in length  it extends from the mid-atlantic  ridge  near tristan da cunha and the gough islands  to the african coast  at the walvis ridge is one of few examples of a hotspot seamount chain that links a flood basalt province to an active hotspot  it is also considered one of the most important hotspot tracks because the tristan hotspot is one of few primary or deep mantle from the mid-atlantic  ridge  the walvis ridge and the rio grande rise are the most distinctive feature of the south atlantic sea floor  they originated from hotspot volcanism and together they form a mirrored symmetry across the mid-atlantic  ridge  with the tristan hotspot at its centre  two of the distinct sections in the walvis ridge have similar mirrored regions in the rio grande rise  for example  the eastern section of the walvis ridge evolved in conjunction with the torres arch  the western end of the rio grande rise  off the brazilian coast  and  as the south atlantic gradually opened  these structures became separated  the complex of seamounts in the western end of the walvis ridge  however  does not have a similar structure on the american side  but there is a zapiola seamount complex south of the eastern end of the rio grande the formation of this mirrored structure is the result of the opening of the south atlantic some 120  mya and the paraná and etendeka continental flood basalts  the lateral-most  parts of the structure  formed at the beginning of this process in areas that are now located in brazil and walvis ridge is divided into three main kimberlites in the central democratic republic of congo and angola align with the walvis tristan-gough  hotspot track first formed over the mantle plume that formed the etendeka-paraná  continental flood basalts some 135  to 132  the eastern section of the ridge is thought to have been created in the middle cretaceous period  between 120  to 80  while the mantle plume remained large and stable  the eastern walvis ridge formed along with the rio grande rise over the mid-atlantic  during the maastrichtian 60  million years ago  the orientation of spreading changed  which is still visible in the orientation of the various sections of the walvis the mantle plume then gradually became unstable and bifurcated 60  to 70  ma to produce the two separate tristan and gough hotspot tracks  it finally disintegrated 35  to 45  ma and formed the guyot province in the western end of the of volcanic explosions were recorded on the walvis ridge in 2001  and 2002.  these explosions seemed to come from an unnamed seamount on the northern side of the ridge and are thought to be unrelated to the tristan ewing seamount is part of the ridge the eocene layer of mysterious origin  elmo  is a period of global warming that occurred 53.7  ma  about two million years after the paleocene–eocene thermal maximum  this period manifests as a carbonate-poor  red clay layer unique to the walvis ridge and is similar to the petm  but of smaller walvis ridge is a natural obstacle for the agulhas rings  mesoscale warm core rings that are shed from the agulhas current south of the agulhas bank  in average  five such rings are shed each year  a number that varies considerably between the rings tend cross the walvis ridge at its deepest part  but they still lose transitional speed and many rings decay their transitional speed drop from 5.2±3.6  km day to 4.6±3.1  km day  but it is not clear how much the walvis ridge is responsible for this drop  since the rings  speed drop to 4.3±2.2  km day between the walvis ridge and the mid-atlantic  the rings can cross the south atlantic in 2.5–3  years but only two thirds make it farther than the walvis when the rings pass over the cap basin south of the walvis ridge they are frequently disturbed by the benguela current  interaction between rings  and bottom topography such as the vema seamount  but there are fewer obstacles and disturbances west of the walvis ridge were the rings tend stabilise  the agulhas rings transport an estimated 1-5  sv  millions m² s  of water from the indian ocean to the south around antarctica  antarctic bottom water  aabw  enters the cape basin between the agulhas bank and the agulhas ridge after which it flows west north of the agulhas ridge  aabw then retroflects at the south-western  end of the walvis ridge  flows north-east  along the ridge before being retroflected south by north atlantic deep water  with which it exits the cape basin and flows into the indian 26°s  6°e﻿    ﻿26°s  6°e﻿    -26;  6
