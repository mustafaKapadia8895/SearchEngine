 human y-chromosome  dna haplogroup -  wikipediain human genetics  a human y-chromosome  dna haplogroup is a haplogroup defined by mutations in the non-recombining  portions of dna from the y chromosome  called y-dna).  mutations that are shared by many people are called single-nucleotide  polymorphisms human y-chromosome  accumulates roughly two mutations per y-dna  haplogroups represent major branches of the y-chromosome  phylogenetic tree that share hundreds or even thousands of mutations unique to each haplogroup the y-chromosomal  most recent common ancestor (y-mrca,  informally known as y-chromosomal  adam  is the most recent common ancestor  mrca  from whom all currently living men are descended patrilineally  y-chromosomal  adam is estimated to have lived roughly 236,000  years ago in africa  by examining other bottlenecks all eurasian men are descended from a man who lived 69,000  years ago  another major bottleneck occurred about 5,000  years ago and subsequently most eurasian men can trace their ancestry back to a dozen ancestors who lived 5,000  years haplogroups are defined by the presence of a series of y-dna  snp markers  subclades are defined by a terminal snp  the snp furthest down in the y-chromosome  phylogenetic the y chromosome consortium  ycc  developed a system of naming major y-dna  haplogroups with the capital letters a through t  with further subclades named using numbers and lower case letters  ycc longhand nomenclature   ycc shorthand nomenclature names y-dna  haplogroups and their subclades with the first letter of the major y-dna  haplogroup followed by a dash and the name of the defining terminal haplogroup nomenclature is changing over time to accommodate the increasing number of snps being discovered and tested  and the resulting expansion of the y-chromosome  phylogenetic tree  this change in nomenclature has resulted in inconsistent nomenclature being used in different this inconsistency  and increasingly cumbersome longhand nomenclature  has prompted a move towards using the simpler shorthand nomenclature  in september 2012,  family tree dna provided the following explanation of its changing y-dna  haplogroup nomenclature to individual customers on their y-dna  results pages  note that the haplogroup mentioned below relates to a specific time customers of family tree dna have seen the ycc-tree  of homo sapiens evolve over the past several years as new snps have been discovered  sometimes these new snps cause a substantial change in the  longhand  explanation of your terminal haplogroup  because of this confusion  we introduced a shorthand version a few years ago that lists the branch of the tree and your terminal snp  i e  j-l147,  in lieu of j1c3d.  therefore  in the very near term  family tree dna will discontinue showing the current  longhand  on the tree and we will focus all of our discussions around your terminal defining snp  this changes no science – it just provides an easier and less confusing way for us all to communicate bennett greenspan  family tree dna dr  michael f  hammer  university of arizonay-chromosomal  adamhaplogroup ahaplogroup bhaplogroup dhaplogroup ehaplogroup chaplogroup ghaplogroup hhaplogroup ihaplogroup jhaplogroup lhaplogroup thaplogroup nhaplogroup ohaplogroup shaplogroup mhaplogroup qhaplogroup rusing fast evolving snps  haplogroup a is the nry macrohaplogroup from which all modern paternal haplogroups descend  it is sparsely distributed in africa  being concentrated among khoisan populations in the southwest and nilotic populations toward the northast in the nile valley  bt is a subclade of haplogroup a  more precisely of the a1b  clade (a2-t  in cruciani et al  2011),  as follows the defining mutations separating ct  all haplogroups except for a and b  are m168  and m294.  the site of origin is unknown but likely in either or africa approximately 88,000  years groups descending from haplogroup f are found in some 90%  of the world s population  but almost exclusively outside of sub-saharan  africa f xg h i j k is rare in modern populations and peaks in south asia  especially sri it also appears to have long been present in south east asia  has been reported at rates of 4–5%  in sulawesi and lembata  one study  which did not comprehensively screen for other subclades of f-m89   including some subclades of ghijk   found that indonesian men with the snp p14/pf2704   which is equivalent to m89),  comprise 1.8%  of men in west timor  1.5%  of flores 5.4%  of lembata 2.3%  of sulawesi and 0.2%  in f   f xf1,f2,f3)  has been reported among 10%  of males in sri lanka and south india  5%  in pakistan  as well as lower levels among the tamang people  nepal   and in iran  f1  (p91),  f2  (m427)  and f3  (m481;
