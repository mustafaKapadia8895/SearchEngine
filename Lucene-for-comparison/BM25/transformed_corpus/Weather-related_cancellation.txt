 weather-related  cancellation -  wikipediaa weather-related  cancellation or delay is closure  cancellation  or delay of an institution  operation  or event as a result of inclement weather  certain institutions  such as schools  are likely to close when bad weather  such as snow  flooding  tropical cyclones  or extreme heat or cold impairs travel  causes power outages  or otherwise impedes public safety or makes opening the facility impossible or more difficult  depending upon the local climate  the chances of a school or school system closing may vary  while some regions may close or delay schools when there is any question of safety  others located in areas where bad weather is a regular occurrence may remain open  as local people may be accustomed to travelling under such conditions many countries and sub-national  jurisdictions have mandates for a minimum number of school days in a year  to meet these requirements  many schools that face a likelihood of closure build a few extra school days into their calendar  if  by the end of the year  these days are unused  some schools give students days off  if all snow days are exhausted  and inclement weather requires more closures  schools usually make the days up later in the year  us state education departments have  for example by administrative decision late in the 2015  texas school year  occasionally issued waivers to schools  so that they do not need make up days for weather-related  are various reasons for weather-related  cancellations  such as icy streets  dangerous quantities of snow  etc safety is prime when deciding whether to cancel or delay  officials may close schools to prevent accidents and other problems caused by inclement weather minor storms  when safety is of less concern  may cause few or no cancellations or delays  in severe inclement weather  however  only the most essential operations remain functional  operations considered essential include health care  emergency services  and retail of basic necessities  in health care environments  employees may remain at the facility around the clock if travel is impaired or dangerous  as those facilities contain basic accommodations for sleeping and eating such as on-call  rooms  while tourist attractions generally close  those housing live animals may need essential employees to provide proper animal care television and radio services generally keep operating  unless they in turn are taken off the air by the weather   and travel as necessary  elected officials travel as necessary to provide services to the public  snow removal crews remain at work some inclement weather makes road passage impossible or difficult  in developed nations  municipalities attempt to clear snow-covered  roads—but this is not always possible  and often many cannot travel  in deeper snowfalls  personal vehicles may become trapped  and their removal may take several days  this influences decisions on closures beyond the end of snowfall  the ability of employees to reach work places is a factor various types of severe weather can damage structures temporarily or render them permanently useless  cause power outages  or prevent heat or air conditioning from working a snow day in the united states and canada is a day that school classes are cancelled or delayed by snow  heavy ice  or extremely low temperatures  similar measures occur in response to flooding  tornado watches  and severe weather  storms  hurricanes  dense fog  heavy snow  etc    the criterion for a snow day is primarily the inability of school buses to operate safely on their routes and danger to children who walk to school  often  the school remains officially open even though buses do not run and classes are canceled more and more schools are closing due to extreme heat   heat days   heat days are like snow days  some districts  san diego unified  provides schools with an operational procedure that is used as a guideline that address what actions schools should take at different levels of rising temperatures  and businesses may also be canceled for reasons other than bad weather such as a pandemic  power failure  terrorist attack  or bomb threat  or in honor of a school staff member who has recently died  in some cases  only one school or business in a town may close  due localized issues such as a water main break or a lack of heat or air-conditioning.inclement  weather that causes cancellation or delay is more likely in regions that are less able to handle the situation  snow days are less common in more northern areas of the united states that are used to heavy winter snowfall  because municipalities are well equipped to clear roads and remove snow  in areas less accustomed to snow—such as atlanta  dallas  memphis  or chattanooga—even small snowfalls of an inch or two may render roads unsafe in some areas  schools include extra days in their calendar as "built-in"  snow days which allow a school to get in the minimum amount of hours or days for instruction  in wisconsin for instance  180  minimum teaching days are mandated by law   once the number of snow days taken exceeds the number of built-in  days  the snow days must be made in other states  all snow days must be made for example  schools may extend the remaining school days later into the afternoon  shorten spring break  or delay the start of summer vacation  however some schools are more forgiving  and do not mandate make-up  days  in the event of heavy snow  tools have arisen to help students calculate the chance of a weather related cancellation  most commonly snow days in the united kingdom  snow days are a relatively uncommon event  especially in southern regions  scottish  northern irish  welsh  and northern english schools may experience some closures during the winter months  often due to travel disruption  in southern england  however  significant snowfall is a less frequent event  rarely lasting for more than a few days across low-lying  areas instead of cancelling an entire school day  some schools may delay opening by  for example  one or two hours  or announce a particular opening time  this can be advantageous in places where schools are not charged a  snow day  by delaying their opening  many school authorities cancel the whole morning kindergarten under these circumstances  this is particularly common during light snowfalls of 2  inches (5.1  cm  or less in areas accustomed to moderate winter snowfall  such as the new york metropolitan area and adjacent southern new england in the event of fog  some schools may delay the opening of school three hours but extend the day an extra hour some schools in sydney  new south wales  may  at their discretion close when temperatures reach above 40  degrees celsiussome school districts in the united states close at their discretion for high temperatures and air quality workplaces are less likely to close during mildly inclement weather  but the more severe the storm  the more likely a workplace is to close some employers who use the most essential types of employees  such as health care facilities  have some or all of their employees stay and sleep on the premises while off duty if bad weather that hampers commuting is anticipated  many supermarkets  convenience stores  and gas stations try to remain open to meet public need and the opportunity for increased business  less critical businesses  such as clothing or antique shops  may close in moderate or severe weather in most severe storms  police and fire departments use specialized vehicles to respond to emergencies  other workers involved in handling issues pertaining to the inclement weather  such as snow plow operators  report to work  and reporters and local elected officials stay on duty to serve the public in severe weather  airlines  rail service providers  bus operators  and other public transport may cancel or reduce services  route impassability  airport closure  employees  safety  and public safety may result in such action  however  some modes of transport are more prone to severe weather than others  and different forms of bad weather have different impacts in air travel  the decision is often based on the guidelines of the country s civil aviation authority  such as the federal aviation administration  faa  in the united states even when the service does operate  unplanned delays are possible  as operators take extra precautions or routes are congested  the level of service provided may be diminished due to a lower demand for service  fewer operators being available  or fewer passable routes  yet sometimes demand for public transport may increase as more commuters choose not to drive their own vehicles in particularly hot weather  rail vehicles may be delayed by the expansion of the steel tracks public transport may continue to operate on main arteries  though they may still experience delays  buses that operate on secondary roads  especially those that are narrow or difficult to negotiate  may either be completely cancelled or diverted to a main road although bad weather generally has little effect on an underground subway system in a major metropolitan area  electricity outages and flooding may disrupt services  for example  on august 8,  2007,  following a tornado in brooklyn in new york city  the new york city subway flooded  causing all trains to grind to a halt during rush increased demand may result from employers and schools clearing out in anticipation of a tropical cyclone  hurricane  or other severe weather system as people turn to the subway when other modes of transport are threatened
