 outgoing longwave radiation -  wikipediaoutgoing longwave radiation  olr  is the energy radiating from the earth as infrared radiation at low energy to space olr is electromagnetic radiation emitted from earth and its atmosphere out to space in the form of thermal radiation  the flux of energy transported by outgoing longwave radiation is measured in w m² over 99%  of outgoing longwave radiation has wavelengths between 4  µm and 100  in the thermal infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum  contributions with wavelengths larger than 40  µm are small  therefore often only wavelengths up to 50  µm are considered   in the wavelength range between 4  µm and 10  µm the spectrum of outgoing longwave radiation overlaps that of solar radiation  and for various applications different cut-off  wavelengths between the two may be chosen radiative cooling by outgoing longwave radiation is the primary way the earth system loses energy  the balance between this loss and the energy gained by radiative heating from incoming solar shortwave radiation determines global heating or cooling of the earth system  energy budget of earth’s local differences between radiative heating and cooling provide the energy that drives atmospheric dynamics olr is a critical component of the earth s energy budget  and represents the total radiation going to space emitted by the earth s radiation balance is quite closely achieved since the olr very nearly equals the shortwave absorbed radiation received at high energy from the sun  thus  the earth s average temperature is very nearly stable  the olr is affected by clouds and dust in the atmosphere  which tend to reduce it to below clear sky values greenhouse gases  such as methane (ch4),  nitrous oxide (n2o),  water vapor (h2o)  and carbon dioxide (co2),  absorb certain wavelengths of olr adding heat to the atmosphere  which in turn causes the respective absorbing layer of the atmosphere to emit more radiation  some of this radiation is directed back towards the earth  increasing the average temperature of the earth s surface  therefore  an increase in the concentration of a greenhouse gas would contribute to global warming by increasing the amount of radiation that is absorbed and emitted by these atmospheric constituents the olr is dependent on the temperature of the radiating body  it is affected by the earth s skin temperature  skin surface emissivity  atmospheric temperature  water vapor profile  and cloud radiation typically refers to radiation in the spectral region from 3  to 100  microns  in the earth’s climate system  longwave radiation involves processes of absorption  scattering  and emissions from atmospheric gases  aerosols  clouds and the surface  measuring outgoing longwave radiation at the top of atmosphere and downwelling longwave radiation at the surface are important for understanding how much radiative energy is kept in our climate system  how much reaches and warms the surface  and how the energy in the atmosphere is distributed to affect developments of clouds outgoing longwave radiation  olr  has been monitored globally since 1975  by a number of successful and valuable satellite missions  these missions include broadband measurements from the earth radiation balance  erb  instrument on the nimbus-6  and nimbus-7  earth radiation budget experiment  erbe  scanner and the erbe non scanner on noaa-9,  noaa-10  and nasa earth radiation budget satellite  erbs   the clouds and the earth s radiant energy system  ceres  instrument aboard nasa s aqua and terra satellites  and geostationary earth radiation budget instrument  gerb  instrument on the meteosat second generation  msg  satellite downwelling longwave radiation at the surface is mainly measured by pyrgeometer  a most notable ground-based  network for monitoring surface longwave radiation is baseline surface radiation network  bsrn   which provides crucial well-calibrated  measurements for studying global dimming and applications call for calculation of longwave radiation quantities  the balance of global incoming shortwave to outgoing longwave radiative flux determines the energy budget of earth’s climate  local radiative cooling by outgoing longwave radiation  and heating by shortwave radiation  drive the temperature and dynamics of different parts of the atmosphere  from the radiance from a particular direction measured by an instrument  atmospheric properties  like temperature or humidity can be retrieved  etc  calculations of these quantities solve the radiative transfer equations that describe radiation in the atmosphere  usually the solution is done numerically by an atmospheric radiative transfer code adapted to the specific problem
