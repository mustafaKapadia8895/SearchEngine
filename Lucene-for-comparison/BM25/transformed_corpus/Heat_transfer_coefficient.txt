 heat transfer coefficient -  wikipediathe heat transfer coefficient or film coefficient  or film effectiveness  in thermodynamics and in mechanics is the proportionality constant between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat  i e   the temperature difference  δt  the overall heat transfer by combined modes is usually expressed on terms of an overall conductance or overall heat transfer coefficient  u  heat transfer  q=ua(t2-t1).where:it  is used in calculating the heat transfer  typically by convection or phase transition between a fluid and a solid  the heat transfer coefficient has si units in watts per squared meter kelvin  w/(m2k).the  heat transfer coefficient is the reciprocal of thermal insulance  this is used for building materials (r-value)  and for clothing insulation there are numerous methods for calculating the heat transfer coefficient in different heat transfer modes  different fluids  flow regimes  and under different thermohydraulic conditions  often it can be estimated by dividing the thermal conductivity of the convection fluid by a length scale  the heat transfer coefficient is often calculated from the nusselt number  a dimensionless number   there are also online calculators available specifically for heat transfer fluid applications  experimental assessment of the heat transfer coefficient poses some challenges especially when small fluxes are to be measured  e g    0.2  w   c m 2    displaystyle <0.2w/cm^{2}}  simple method for determining an overall heat transfer coefficient that is useful to find the heat transfer between simple elements such as walls in buildings or across heat exchangers is shown below  note that this method only accounts for conduction within materials  it does not take into account heat transfer through methods such as radiation  the method is as follows where as the areas for each surface approach being equal the equation can be written as the transfer coefficient per unit area as shown below orit is to be noted that often the value for d x w   displaystyle dx  w   is referred to as the difference of two radii where the inner and outer radii are used to define the thickness of a pipe carrying a fluid  however  this figure may also be considered as a wall thickness in a flat plate transfer mechanism or other common flat surfaces such as a wall in a building when the area difference between each edge of the transmission surface approaches zero in the walls of buildings the above formula can be used to derive the formula commonly used to calculate the heat through building components  architects and engineers call the resulting values either the u-value  or the r-value  of a construction assembly like a wall  each type of value  r or u  are related as the inverse of each other such that r-value    1/u-value  and both are more fully understood through the concept of an overall heat transfer coefficient described in lower section of this document although convective heat transfer can be derived analytically through dimensional analysis  exact analysis of the boundary layer  approximate integral analysis of the boundary layer and analogies between energy and momentum transfer  these analytic approaches may not offer practical solutions to all problems when there are no mathematical models applicable  therefore  many correlations were developed by various authors to estimate the convective heat transfer coefficient in various cases including natural convection  forced convection for internal flow and forced convection for external flow  these empirical correlations are presented for their particular geometry and flow conditions  as the fluid properties are temperature dependent  they are evaluated at the film temperature t f   displaystyle t  f     which is the average of the surface t s   displaystyle t  s   and the surrounding bulk temperature  t ∞   displaystyle   t    infty      recommendations by churchill and chu provide the following correlation for natural convection adjacent to a vertical plane  both for laminar and turbulent k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid  l is the characteristic length with respect to the direction of gravity  ral is the rayleigh number with respect to this length and pr is the prandtl number for laminar flows  the following correlation is slightly more accurate  it is observed that a transition from a laminar to a turbulent boundary occurs when ral exceeds around 109.for  cylinders with their axes vertical  the expressions for plane surfaces can be used provided the curvature effect is not too significant  this represents the limit where boundary layer thickness is small relative to cylinder diameter d   displaystyle d    the correlations for vertical plane walls can be used whenwhere g r l   displaystyle gr  l   is the grashof number w  h  mcadams suggested the following correlations for horizontal the induced buoyancy will be different depending upon whether the hot surface is facing up or down for a hot surface facing up  or a cold surface facing down  for laminar flow and for turbulent flow for a hot surface facing down  or a cold surface facing up  for laminar flow the characteristic length is the ratio of the plate surface area to perimeter  if the surface is inclined at an angle θ with the vertical then the equations for a vertical plate by churchill and chu may be used for θ up to 60°;  if the boundary layer flow is laminar  the gravitational constant g is replaced with g cosθ when calculating the ra term for cylinders of sufficient length and negligible end effects  churchill and chu has the following correlation for 10  − 5    r a d   10  12    displaystyle 10^{-5}<\mathrm   ra

laminar flow in tubes where d   displaystyle d  is the internal diameter  μ b   displaystyle   mu    b   is the fluid viscosity at the bulk mean temperature  μ w   displaystyle   mu    w   is the viscosity at the tube wall surface dittus-bölter  correlation (1930)  is a common and particularly simple correlation useful for many applications  this correlation is applicable when forced convection is the only mode of heat transfer  i e   there is no boiling  condensation  significant radiation  etc  the accuracy of this correlation is anticipated to be ±15%.for  a fluid flowing in a straight circular pipe with a reynolds number between 10,000  and 120,000   in the turbulent pipe flow range   when the fluid s prandtl number is between 0.7  and 120,  for a location far from the pipe entrance  more than 10  pipe diameters  more than 50  diameters according to many or other flow disturbances  and when the pipe surface is hydraulically smooth  the heat transfer coefficient between the bulk of the fluid and the pipe surface can be expressed explicitly as where the fluid properties necessary for the application of this equation are evaluated at the bulk temperature thus avoiding iterationin analyzing the heat transfer associated with the flow past the exterior surface of a solid  the situation is complicated by phenomena such as boundary layer separation  various authors have correlated charts and graphs for different geometries and flow conditions  for flow parallel to a plane surface  where x   displaystyle x  is the distance from the edge and l   displaystyle l  is the height of the boundary layer  a mean nusselt number can be calculated using the colburn exist simple fluid-specific  correlations for heat transfer coefficient in boiling  the thom correlation is for the flow of boiling water  subcooled or saturated at pressures up to about 20  mpa  under conditions where the nucleate boiling contribution predominates over forced convection  this correlation is useful for rough estimation of expected temperature difference given the heat δ t s a t   22.5  ⋅ q 0.5  exp ⁡   − p   8.7      displaystyle  delta t_{sat}=22.5\cdot  {q}^{0.5}\exp(-p/8.7)}  where note that this empirical correlation is specific to the units given the resistance to the flow of heat by the material of pipe wall can be expressed as a  heat transfer coefficient of the pipe wall   however  one needs to select if the heat flux is based on the pipe inner or the outer diameter  selecting to base the heat flux on the pipe inner diameter  and assuming that the pipe wall thickness is small in comparison with the pipe inner diameter  then the heat transfer coefficient for the pipe wall can be calculated as if the wall were not needed  where k is the effective thermal conductivity of the wall material and x is the wall thickness if the above assumption does not hold  then the wall heat transfer coefficient can be calculated using the following expression where di and do are the inner and outer diameters of the pipe  respectively the thermal conductivity of the tube material usually depends on temperature  the mean thermal conductivity is often used for two or more heat transfer processes acting in parallel  heat transfer coefficients simply add for two or more heat transfer processes connected in series  heat transfer coefficients add example  consider a pipe with a fluid flowing inside  the approximate rate of heat transfer between the bulk of the fluid inside the pipe and the pipe external surface overall heat transfer coefficient u   displaystyle u  is a measure of the overall ability of a series of conductive and convective barriers to transfer heat  it is commonly applied to the calculation of heat transfer in heat exchangers  but can be applied equally well to other problems for the case of a heat exchanger  u   displaystyle u  can be used to determine the total heat transfer between the two streams in the heat exchanger by the following relationship where the overall heat transfer coefficient takes into account the individual heat transfer coefficients of each stream and the resistance of the pipe material  it can be calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of a series of thermal resistances  but more complex relationships exist  for example when heat transfer takes place by different routes in parallel  where the heat transfer coefficient is the heat transferred per unit area per kelvin  thus area is included in the equation as it represents the area over which the transfer of heat takes place  the areas for each flow will be different as they represent the contact area for each fluid side the thermal resistance due to the pipe wall is calculated by the following relationship wherethis represents the heat transfer by conduction in the pipe the thermal conductivity is a characteristic of the particular material  values of thermal conductivities for various materials are listed in the list of thermal conductivities as mentioned earlier in the article the convection heat transfer coefficient for each stream depends on the type of fluid  flow properties and temperature properties some typical heat transfer coefficients include often during their use  heat exchangers collect a layer of fouling on the surface which  in addition to potentially contaminating a stream  reduces the effectiveness of heat exchangers  in a fouled heat exchanger the buildup on the walls creates an additional layer of materials that heat must flow through  due to this new layer  there is additional resistance within the heat exchanger and thus the overall heat transfer coefficient of the exchanger is reduced  the following relationship is used to solve for the heat transfer resistance with the additional fouling equation uses the overall heat transfer coefficient of an unfouled heat exchanger and the fouling resistance to calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient of a fouled heat exchanger  the equation takes into account that the perimeter of the heat exchanger is different on the hot and cold sides  the perimeter used for the p   displaystyle p  does not matter as long as it is the same  the overall heat transfer coefficients will adjust to take into account that a different perimeter was used as the product u p   displaystyle up  will remain the same the fouling resistances can be calculated for a specific heat exchanger if the average thickness and thermal conductivity of the fouling are known  the product of the average thickness and thermal conductivity will result in the fouling resistance on a specific side of the heat
