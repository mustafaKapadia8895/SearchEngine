 caribbean sea -  wikipediathe caribbean sea  spanish  mar caribe  french  mer des caraïbes dutch  caraïbische zee  is a sea of the atlantic ocean in the tropics of the western hemisphere  it is bounded by mexico and central america to the west and south west  to the north by the greater antilles starting with cuba  to the east by the lesser antilles  and to the south by the north coast of south america the entire area of the caribbean sea  the numerous islands of the west indies  and adjacent coasts  are collectively known as the caribbean  the caribbean sea is one of the largest seas and has an area of about 2,754,000  km2  (1,063,000  sq the sea s deepest point is the cayman trough  between the cayman islands and jamaica  at 7,686  m (25,220  ft  below sea level  the caribbean coastline has many gulfs and bays  the gulf of gonâve  gulf of venezuela  gulf of darién  golfo de los mosquitos  gulf of paria and gulf of honduras the caribbean sea has the world s second biggest barrier reef  the mesoamerican barrier reef  it runs 1,000  km (620  mi  along the coasts of mexico  belize  guatemala  and name  caribbean  derives from the caribs  one of the region s dominant native american groups at the time of european contact during the late 15th  century  after the discovery of america by christopher columbus in 1492,  the spanish term antillas applied to the lands  stemming from this   sea of the antilles  became a common alternative name for  caribbean sea  in various european languages  during the first century of development  spanish dominance in the region remained undisputed from the 16th  century  europeans visiting the caribbean region identified the  south sea   the pacific ocean  to the south of the isthmus of panama  as opposed to the  north sea   the caribbean sea  to the north of the same caribbean sea had been unknown to the populations of eurasia until 1492,  when christopher columbus sailed into caribbean waters on a quest to find a sea route to asia  at that time the western hemisphere in general was unknown to europeans  following the discovery of the islands by columbus  the area was quickly colonised by several western cultures  initially spain  then later england  the dutch republic  france  courland and denmark   following the colonisation of the caribbean islands  the caribbean sea became a busy area for european-based  marine trading and transport  and this commerce eventually attracted pirates such as samuel bellamy and blackbeard   see piracy in the caribbean due to the abundance of sunshine  year-round  tropical temperatures moderated by the almost constant trade winds and the great variety of scenic destinations to visit  during the second half of the 20th  century and on into the 21st  the caribbean sea became a popular place for tourism as of the area is home to 22  island territories and borders 12  continental countries the international hydrographic organization defines the limits of the caribbean sea as that  although barbados is an island on the same continental shelf  it is considered to be in the atlantic ocean rather than the caribbean sea the caribbean sea is an oceanic sea largely situated on the caribbean plate  the caribbean sea is separated from the ocean by several island arcs of various ages  the youngest stretches from the lesser antilles to the virgin islands to the north east of trinidad and tobago off the coast of venezuela  this arc was formed by the collision of the south american plate with the caribbean plate and includes active and extinct volcanoes such as mount pelee  the quill  volcano  on sint eustatius in the caribbean netherlands and morne trois pitons on dominica  the larger islands in the northern part of the sea cuba  hispaniola  jamaica and puerto rico lie on an older island arc the geological age of the caribbean sea is estimated to be between 160  and 180  million years and was formed by a horizontal fracture that split the supercontinent called pangea in the mesozoic it is assumed the proto-caribbean  basin existed in the devonian period  in the early carboniferous movement of gondwana to the north and its convergence with the euramerica basin decreased in size  the next stage of the caribbean sea s formation began in the triassic  powerful rifting led to the formation of narrow troughs  stretching from modern newfoundland to the west coast of the gulf of mexico which formed siliciclastic sedimentary rocks  in the early jurassic due to powerful marine transgression  water broke into the present area of the gulf of mexico creating a vast shallow pool  the emergence of deep basins in the caribbean occurred during the middle jurassic rifting  the emergence of these basins marked the beginning of the atlantic ocean and contributed to the destruction of pangaea at the end of the late jurassic  during the cretaceous the caribbean acquired the shape close to that seen today  in the early paleogene due to marine regression the caribbean became separated from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean by the land of cuba and haiti  the caribbean remained like this for most of the cenozoic until the holocene when rising water levels of the oceans restored communication with the atlantic ocean the caribbean s floor is composed of sub-oceanic  sediments of deep red clay in the deep basins and troughs  on continental slopes and ridges calcareous silts are found  clay minerals likely having been deposited by the mainland river orinoco and the magdalena river  deposits on the bottom of the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico have a thickness of about 1  km (0.62  mi   upper sedimentary layers relate to the period from the mesozoic to the cenozoic (250  million years ago to present  and the lower layers from the paleozoic to the mesozoic the caribbean sea floor is divided into five basins separated from each other by underwater ridges and mountain ranges  atlantic ocean water enters the caribbean through the anegada passage lying between the lesser antilles and virgin islands and the windward passage located between cuba and haiti  the yucatán channel between mexico and cuba links the gulf of mexico with the caribbean  the deepest points of the sea lie in cayman trough with depths reaching approximately 7,686  m (25,220  ft   despite this  the caribbean sea is considered a relatively shallow sea in comparison to other bodies of water the pressure of the south american plate to the east of the caribbean causes the region of the lesser antilles to have high volcanic activity  there was a very serious eruption of mount pelée in 1902  which caused many casualties the caribbean sea floor is also home to two oceanic trenches  the cayman trench and puerto rico trench  which put the area at a high risk of earthquakes  underwater earthquakes pose a threat of generating tsunamis which could have a devastating effect on the caribbean islands  scientific data reveals that over the last 500  years the area has seen a dozen earthquakes above 7.5  most recently  a 7.1  earthquake struck haiti on january 12,  2010.the  hydrology of the sea has a high level of homogeneity  annual variations in monthly average water temperatures at the surface do not exceed 3  °c (5.4  °f   over the past fifty years the caribbean has gone through three stages  cooling until 1974;  a cold phase with peaks during 1974–1976  and 1984–1986  then  a warming phase with an increase in temperature of 0.6  °c (1.1  °f  per year  virtually all temperature extremes were associated with the phenomena of el niño and la niña  the salinity of seawater is about 3.6%  and its density is 1,023.5–1,024.0  kg/m3  (63.90–63.93  lb cu ft   the surface water colour is blue-green  to green the caribbean s depth in its wider basins and deep water temperatures are similar to those of the atlantic  atlantic deep water is thought to spill into the caribbean and contribute to the general deep water of its the surface water (30  feet  100  m  acts as an extension of the northern atlantic as the guiana current and part of the north equatorial current enter the sea on the east  on the western side of the sea the trade winds influence a northerly current which causes an upwelling and a rich fishery near caribbean is home to about 9%  of the world s coral reefs covering about 50,000  km2  (19,000  sq mi   most of which are located off the caribbean islands and the central american among them stands out the belize barrier reef with an area of 963  km2  (372  sq mi  which was declared a world heritage site in 1996.  it forms part of the great mayan reef also known as the mbrs and being over 1,000  km (600  mi  in length is the world s second longest  it runs along the caribbean coasts of mexico  belize  guatemala and honduras during the past ten unusually warm caribbean waters have been increasingly threatening caribbean coral reefs  coral reefs support some of the most diverse marine habitats in the world  but they are fragile ecosystems  when tropical waters become unusually warm for extended periods of time  microscopic plants called zooxanthellae  which are symbiotic partners living within the coral polyp tissues  die off  these plants provide food for the corals  and give them their color  the result of the death and dispersal of these tiny plants is called coral bleaching  and can lead to the devastation of large areas of reef  over 42%  of corals are completely bleached and 95%  are experiencing some type of historically the caribbean is thought to contain 14%  of the world s coral habitats supported by the reefs are critical to such tourist activities as fishing and diving  and provide an annual economic value to caribbean nations of us$3.1–4.6  billion  continued destruction of the reefs could severely damage the region s a protocol of the convention for the protection and development of the marine environment of the wider caribbean region came in effect in 1986  to protect the various endangered marine life of the caribbean through forbidding human activities that would advance the continued destruction of such marine life in various areas  currently this protocol has been ratified by 15  also  several charitable organisations have been formed to preserve the caribbean marine life  such as caribbean conservation corporation which seeks to study and protect sea turtles while educating others about connection with the foregoing  the institute of marine sciences and limnology of the national autonomous university of mexico  conducted a regional study  funded by the department of technical cooperation of the international atomic energy agency  in which specialists from 11  latin american countries  colombia  costa rica  cuba  guatemala  haiti  honduras  mexico  nicaragua  panama  dominican republic  venezuela plus jamaica  participated  the findings indicate that heavy metals such as mercury  arsenic  and lead  have been identified in the coastal zone of the caribbean sea  analysis of toxic metals and hydrocarbons is based on the investigation of coastal sediments that have accumulated less than 50  meters deep during the last hundred and fifty years  the project results were presented in vienna in the forum  water matters   and the 2011  general conference of said multilateral caribbean weather is influenced by the gulf stream and humboldt current ocean the tropical location of the sea helps the water to maintain a warm temperature ranging from the low of 21–26  °c (70–79  °f  by the season the caribbean is a focal area for many hurricanes within the western hemisphere  a series of low pressure systems develop off the west coast of africa and make their way across the atlantic ocean  while most of these systems do not become tropical storms  some do  the tropical storms can develop into atlantic hurricanes  often in the low pressure areas of the eastern caribbean  the caribbean hurricane season as a whole lasts from june through november  with the majority of hurricanes occurring during august and september  on average around 9  tropical storms form each year  with 5  reaching hurricane strength  according to the national hurricane center 385  hurricanes occurred in the caribbean between 1494  and 1900.every  year hurricanes represent a potential threat to the islands of the caribbean  due to the extremely destructive nature of these powerful weather systems  coral reefs can easily be damaged by violent wave action  and can be destroyed when a hurricane dumps sand or mud onto a reef  when this happens  the coral organisms are smothered and the reef dies and ultimately breaks apart the region has a high level of biodiversity and many species are endemic to the caribbean the vegetation of the region is mostly tropical but differences in topography  soil and climatic conditions increase species diversity  where there are porous limestone terraced islands these are generally poor in nutrients  it is estimated that 13,000  species of plants grow in the caribbean of which 6,500  are endemic  for example  guaiac wood  guaiacum officinale   the flower of which is the national flower of jamaica and the bayahibe rose  pereskia quisqueyana  which is the national flower of the dominican republic and the ceiba which is the national tree of both puerto rico and guatemala  the mahogany is the national tree of the dominican republic and belize  the caimito  chrysophyllum cainito  grows throughout the caribbean  in coastal zones there are coconut palms and in lagoons and estuaries are found thick areas of black mangrove and red mangrove  rhizophora mangle  in shallow water flora and fauna is concentrated around coral reefs where there is little variation in water temperature  purity and salinity  leeward side of lagoons provide areas of growth for sea grasses  turtle grass  thalassia testudinum  is common in the caribbean as is manatee grass  syringodium filiforme  which can grow together as well as in fields of single species at depths up to 20  m (66  ft   another type shoal grass  halodule wrightii  grows on sand and mud surfaces at depths of up to 5  m (16  ft   in brackish water of harbours and estuaries at depths less than 2.5  m (8  ft 2  in  widgeongrass  ruppia maritima  grows  representatives of three species belonging to the genus halophila   halophila baillonii  halophila engelmannii and halophila decipiens  are found at depths of up to 30  m (98  ft  except for halophila engelmani which does not grow below 5  m (16  ft  and is confined to the bahamas  florida  the greater antilles and the western part of the caribbean  halophila baillonii has been found only in the lesser biota in the region have representatives of both the indian and pacific oceans which were caught in the caribbean before the emergence of the isthmus of panama four million years in the caribbean sea there are around 1,000  documented species of fish  including sharks  bull shark  tiger shark  silky shark and caribbean reef shark   flying fish  giant oceanic manta ray  angel fish  spotfin butterflyfish  parrotfish  atlantic goliath grouper  tarpon and moray eels  throughout the caribbean there is industrial catching of lobster and sardines  off the coast of yucatán peninsula  there are 90  species of mammals in the caribbean including sperm whales  humpback whales and dolphins  the island of jamaica is home to seals and manatees  the caribbean monk seal which lived in the caribbean is considered extinct  the solenodon is endangered there are 500  species of reptiles (94%  of which are endemic   islands are inhabited by some endemic species such as rock iguanas and american crocodile  the blue iguana  endemic to the island of grand cayman  is endangered  the green iguana is invasive to grand cayman  the mona ground iguana which inhabits the island of mona  puerto rico  is endangered  the rhinoceros iguana from the island of hispaniola which is shared between haiti and the dominican republic is also endangered  the region has several types of sea turtle  loggerhead  green turtle  hawksbill  leatherback turtle  atlantic ridley and olive ridley   some species are threatened with their populations have been greatly reduced since the 17th  century – the number of green turtles has declined from 91  million to 300,000  and hawksbill turtles from 11  million to less than 30,000  by 170  species of amphibians that live in the region are endemic  the habitats of almost all members of the toad family  poison dart frogs  tree frogs and leptodactylidae  a type of frog  are limited to only one the golden coqui is in serious threat of extinction in the caribbean 600  species of birds have been recorded of which 163  are endemic such as the tody  fernandina s flicker and palmchat  the american yellow warbler is found in many areas as is the green heron  of the endemic species 48  are threatened with extinction including the puerto rican amazon  yellow-breasted  crake and the zapata wren  according to birdlife international in 2006  in cuba 29  species of bird are in danger of extinction and two species officially the black-fronted  piping guan is endangered as is the plain pigeon  the antilles along with central america lie in the flight path of migrating birds from north america so the size of populations is subject to seasonal fluctuations  in the forests are found parrots  bananaquit and toucans  over the open sea can be seen frigatebirds and tropicbirds the caribbean region has seen a significant increase in human activity since the colonisation period  the sea is one of the largest oil production areas in the world  producing approximately 170  million needed  per the area also generates a large fishing industry for the surrounding countries  accounting for 500,000  tonnes (490,000  long tons  550,000  short tons  of fish a activity in the area also accounts for a significant amount of pollution  the pan american health organization estimated in 1993  that only about 10%  of the sewage from the central american and caribbean island countries is properly treated before being released into the caribbean region supports a large tourism industry  the caribbean tourism organization calculates that about 12  million people a year visit the area  including  in 1991–1992)  about 8  million cruise ship tourists  tourism based upon scuba diving and snorkeling on coral reefs of many caribbean islands makes a major contribution to their caribbean is the setting for countless literary efforts often related to piracy acts and swashbuckling  one memorable work of pulp fiction has in its title a geographic feature unique in its way to the islands  fear cay  the eleventh doc savage adventure by lester dent  many james bond adventures were set there  all of the action of the monkey island series videogames takes place within the caribbean sea area  it is also well known as the location of the pirates of the caribbean films  featuring port royal  less swashbuckling  but not lacking in man-against-the-sea  exploits  is peter matthiessen s far tortuga (1975),  which chronicles the adventures of a turtling crew in the late 1960s.the  video game series assassin s creed features the caribbean as an important place in its timeline  for
