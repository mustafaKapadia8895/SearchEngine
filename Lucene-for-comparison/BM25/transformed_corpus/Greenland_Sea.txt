 greenland sea -  wikipediathe greenland sea is a body of water that borders greenland to the west  the svalbard archipelago to the east  fram strait and the arctic ocean to the north  and the norwegian sea and iceland to the south  the greenland sea is often defined as part of the arctic sometimes as part of the atlantic however  definitions of the arctic ocean and its seas tend to be imprecise or arbitrary  in general usage the term  arctic ocean  would exclude the greenland in oceanographic studies the greenland sea is considered part of the nordic seas  along with the norwegian sea  the nordic seas are the main connection between the arctic and atlantic oceans and  as such  could be of great significance in a possible shutdown of thermohaline circulation  in oceanography the arctic ocean and nordic seas are often referred to collectively as the  arctic mediterranean sea   a marginal sea of the sea has arctic climate with regular northern winds and temperatures rarely rising above 0  °c  it previously contained the odden ice tongue  or odden  area  which extended eastward from the main east greenland ice edge in the vicinity of 72–74°n  during the winter and acted as a key winter ice formation area in the arctic  the west ice forms in winter in the greenland sea  north of iceland  between greenland and jan mayen island  it is a major breeding ground of harp seal and hooded seal that has been used for seal hunting for more than 200  years the international hydrographic organization defines the limits of the greenland sea as the north  a line joining the northernmost point of spitzbergen to the northernmost point of greenland on the east  the west coast of west spitzbergen of spitsbergen  on the southeast  a line joining the southernmost point of west spitzbergen to the northern point of jan mayen island  down the west coast of that island to its southern extreme  thence a line to the eastern extreme of gerpir (67°05'n,  13°30'w)  actually at 65°05′n  13°30′w﻿    ﻿65.083°n  13.500°w﻿    65.083;  -13.500]  in iceland on the southwest  a line joining straumnes  nw extreme of iceland  to cape nansen (68°15′n  29°30′w﻿    ﻿68.250°n  29.500°w﻿    68.250;  -29.500)  in greenland on the west  the east and northeast coast of greenland between cape nansen and the northernmost point while the sea is known for millennia  its first scientific investigations were carried out in 1876–1878  within the norwegian north-atlantic  since then  many countries  mostly norway  iceland and russia have sent scientific expeditions to the area  the complex water current system was detailed in 1909  by the fridtjof greenland sea was a popular hunting ground for the whaling industry for 300  years  until 1911,  primarily based in spitsbergen  at that point  the formerly rich whale population here  was so depleted that the industry was no longer profitable  the remaining whales of the greenland sea has been protected ever since  but the populations had not shown any proof of significant regeneration  in the last 20  years  polar biologists reports an increase in the local bowhead whale population and in 2015,  arctic scientists discovered a surprising abundance of them in a small area  these results may be interpreted as an early sign of a beginning recovery for this particular species  that once formed the largest bowhead population in the world  at an estimated 52,000  inuit hunted whales on a non-industrial  scale in the greenland sea since the 15th  century  as evidenced by greenland sea is bounded to the west by the island of greenland  and to the south by the denmark strait and iceland  to the southeast  behind the jan mayen island  norway  lies the vast expanse of the norwegian sea  of which greenland sea may be considered an extension  across the fram strait to the northeast  the sea is delimited by the svalbard archipelago  norway  the bottom of the greenland sea is a depression bounded to the south by the underwater greenland-iceland  ridge and to the east by the mohns ridge and knipovich ridge  parts of the mid-atlantic  ridge   to the west  the bottom rises first slowly  but then rapidly toward the wide greenland coastal silts fill the submarine hollows and gorges  silty sands  gravel  boulders  and other products of erosion coat the shelves and the deepest point inside of the sea is 4846  meters  depths down to 5570  meters have been measured in the molloy deep of the fram strait which connects the sea to the arctic ocean on the islands of the greenland sea include the svalbard archipelago  jan mayen as well as coastal islands off the ne greenland shores  such as hovgaard  ella  godfred hansens  île-de-france,  lynn  norske and schnauders island  of those  only the svalbard islands are and jan mayen has only temporal military staff  after the league of nations gave norway jurisdiction over the island  in 1921  norway opened the first meteorological station there  which was a subject of contention between germany and united kingdom during world war several radio and meteorological stations operate on the island nowadays the climate is arctic and varies significantly across the vast sea area  air temperatures fluctuate between −49  °c (−57  °f   near spitsbergen in winter  and 25  °c (77  °f  off greenland in summer  averages are −10  °c (14  °f  in the south and −26  °c (−15  °f  in the north in february  which is the coldest month  the corresponding values for the warmest month  august  are 5  °c (41  °f  in the south and 0  °c (32  °f  in the the summer is very short  as the number of days per year when the temperature rises above 0  °c varies between 225  in the north to 334  in the south  the annual precipitation is 250  mm (10  in  in the north  but is twice higher in the south northern winds continue through the whole year  cooling the surface water and bringing ice to the south  the average surface water temperature is about −1  °с (30  °f  or lower in the north and 1–2  °c in the south  the corresponding summer temperatures are about 0  °c and 6  °c (43  the bottom water temperatures are below −1  °с  the surface water salinity is 33.0–34.5  parts per thousand  ‰  in the eastern and below 32.0‰  in the western parts  increasing to 34.9‰  toward the bottom  the water color is green  tides are semi-diurnal  with the average height of 4.4  m  together with the water currents  they break up the floating ice sheets and mix various water layers both laterally and along the progressively colder waters of north atlantic current sink in the arctic ocean  returning south in the form of cold east greenland current  an important part of the atlantic conveyor belt  which flows along the western part of the sea  along the eastern part flows the warm spitsbergen current  a part of gulf stream  mixtures of cold  fresh water ice melt and the warm  salty spitsbergen current may experience cabbeling  and might contribute to thermohaline circulation  the combination of those currents creates a counter-clockwise  water flow in the central part of the of frequent fogs and winds and currents  which continuously transport ice and icebergs through the greenland sea to the south  the greenland sea has a narrow window for commercial navigation – the ice season starts in october and ends in august  three types of floating ice are distinguished  arctic pack ice  several meters thick   sea ice  about a meter thick  and freshwater winter  a large area north of iceland  between greenland and jan mayen  which is called west ice is covered by continuous ice  it is a major breeding ground for seals  including harp seal  hooded seal and gray it was discovered in the early 18th  century by british whalers and since late 1750s  was used for seal hunting  the hunting was especially intensive in the 19th  century  but declined in the 20th  century due to hunting restrictions and then declined market around 5  april 1952,  a major storm resulted in disappearance of ships with 79  norwegian seal hunters on board  seven other norwegian seal hunting vessels shipwrecked the same odden ice tongue or simply the odden  odden is norwegian word for headland  was a key winter ice formation area in the arctic  it was known for a long time and was encountered by fridtjof nansen but was only fully understood with the advent of satellite odden had a length of about 1,300  km and covered an area of up to 330,000  km² in most years  it extended eastward from the main east greenland ice edge in the vicinity of 72–74°n  during the winter because of the presence of very cold polar surface water in the jan mayen current  which diverts some water eastward from the east greenland current at that latitude  most of the already formed ice continued floating south  driven by the wind  so a cold open water surface was exposed on which new ice formed as frazil ice and pancake ice in the rough seas  producing a giant tongue the salt rejected back into the ocean from this ice formation caused the surface water to become denser and sink  sometimes to great depths (2500  m or more   making this one of the few regions of the ocean where winter convection occurred  which helped drive the entire worldwide system of surface and deep currents known as the thermohaline since the 1990s,  the odden ice tongue rarely needed the greenland sea is densely inhabited by the organisms that form the base of the oceanic food chain  large invertebrates  fish  such as cod  herring  redfish  halibut  and plaice   birds and mammals  including various species of seals  whales  and dolphins  all feed on the smaller invertebrates and small organisms  mosses  lichens  and scanty bushes around the coasts serve as food to the deer and musk oxen  which in turn are hunted by the polar greenland sea was formerly home to a large population of various whale species  especially bowhead whales  but the whaling industry decimated them greatly from the beginning of the 1600s  till 1911.  in the last few decades there have been a few signs indicating a beginning geological survey has estimated that at least 13%  of the worlds undiscovered oil deposits and 30%  of the worlds undiscovered gas pockets are located in the arctic  with the greenland sea potentially holding large amounts of natural gas and lesser amounts of natural gas liquids and crude this has led the greenland s minister and provincial council to offer a large number of off-shore  concessions to potential hydrocarbon  oil and gas  extraction  the majority of the concessions are located in seas west of greenland  primarily the davis strait and baffin bay   but with 19  concessions in the greenland late 2013,  a total of three consortia obtained hydrocarbon extraction rights to four large areas of the greenland sea from the greenland bureau of mineral and petroleum  the consortia are led by the oil companies of statoil  chevron and eni  but includes several other smaller companies such as shell  british petroleum  dong energy and nunaoil  since then  a fifth hydrocarbon concession has been exxon mobil  the largest oil company in the world and with a lot of experience in the arctic  was also applying for oil extraction rights in the greenland sea initially  but pulled out in december 2013  for unexplained reasons  concentrating efforts on shale gas and the american market for oil on deep waters in an ice-filled  arctic environment is a potentially new undertaking for the oil industry and poses many risks and dangers  because of these difficulties the greenland minister council expects the first exploratory drills to take place no sooner than the mid 2020s.  they estimates that a full preliminary program with seismic surveys  exploratory drills and proper safety measures will take about 16  years and an investment of about 500  million dollars in each
