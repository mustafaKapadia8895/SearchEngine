 cyclone olivia -  wikipediasevere tropical cyclone olivia was a powerful cyclone that produced the highest non-tornadic  winds on record on barrow island  408  kilometres per hour (254  mph   breaking the record of 372  km h (231  mph  on mount washington in the united states in april 1934.  the 13th  named storm of the 1995–96  australian region cyclone season  olivia formed on 3  april 1996  to the north of australia s northern territory  the storm moved generally to the southwest  gradually intensifying off western australia  on 8  april  olivia intensified into a severe tropical cyclone and subsequently turned more to the south  steered by a passing trough  on 10  april  olivia produced the worldwide record strongest gust on barrow island  and on the same day the cyclone made landfall near varanus island  the storm quickly weakened over land  dissipating over the great australian bight on 12  april while in its formative stages  olivia produced light rainfall in the northern territory  while offshore western australia  the cyclone forced oil platforms to shut down  and the combination of high winds and waves caused heavy damage to oil facilities  onshore  olivia s high winds damaged several small mining towns  halting operations  every house in pannawonica sustained some damage  one person in the town was injured by flying glass and had to be flown to receive treatment  and nine others were lightly injured  the cyclone also produced heavy rainfall and a localized storm surge  damage was estimated  in the millions   while the storm was dissipating  rough seas in south australia killed a$60  million (us$47.5  million  worth of farm-raised  tuna at port lincoln  the name olivia was retired after the season in early april 1996,  a surge in the trade winds interacted with the monsoon trough to produce an area of on 2  april  the bureau of meteorology  bom  first identified the system as a low to mid-level  low pressure area over indonesia north of darwin  australia  despite strong wind shear  the system slowly became better organized as it moved aided by improving upper-level  early on 5  april  the joint typhoon warning center  jtwc  classified the system as tropical cyclone 25s  as the system began a westward steered by a building mid-level  ridge to the shortly thereafter  the bom upgraded the system to a category 1  cyclone  designating the storm as tropical cyclone the days following olivia s development  persistent wind shear prevented convection from developing around the center of circulation  by 8  april  an upper-level  trough passed to the south of the nascent cyclone  leading to lower following this  the system had developed sufficiently for the jtwc to upgrade it to a category 1  equivalent on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale  sshs   estimating 1  minute sustained winds of 120  km h (75  around the same time  the bom upgraded olivia to a severe tropical cyclone  assessing similar wind speeds but sustained over 10  after the storm reached this intensity  the mid-level  ridge south of the cyclone began to weaken  turning olivia toward the southwest  by 9  april  the system attained category 4  intensity according to the bom as it continued to during the afternoon of 9  april  the bom estimated that olivia attained its lowest barometric pressure of 925  hpa  mbar   along with 10  minute sustained winds of 195  km h (120  around 00:00  utc on 10  april  the jtwc assessed the cyclone to have attained 1  minute winds of 230  km h (145  mph   equivalent to a category 4  on the by this time  another trough bypassed the cyclone  causing olivia to turn to the south and accelerate to the southeast  early on 10  april  data from a nearby weather radar at the learmonth airport near exmouth  western australia  showed that the storm had developed a 65  km (40  mi  wide on 10  april  the center of olivia passed near barrow island at peak intensity  shortly thereafter  the storm passed near varanus island as a high-end  category 4  or low-end  category 5  within several hours of passing by varanus island  olivia made landfall near mardie at peak shortly thereafter  the storm began to weaken overland  accelerating to the southeast  the storm became disorganized and winds decreased below during the afternoon of 11  april  olivia weakened to a tropical low over southern australia  it moved over the great australian bight and lost its identity as a gale-force  low on 12  after it was absorbed by a a minimal cyclone in the timor sea  olivia brought minor rainfall and gusty winds to parts of the northern on 9  april  the fringes of the storm dropped 84  mm (3.3  in  in the kimberley region of western an oil rig in the timor sea recorded a wind gust of 127  km h (79  mph  during the storm s offshore  olivia affected the southern portion of australia s northwest shelf  which had 24  oil and gas the storm produced large swells up to 21  m (69  ft   in conjunction with extreme wind gusts 265  km h (165  waves toppled an oil drilling structure about 40  km (25  mi  northeast of barrow island  the first of its kind to fail since the 1980s.  the waves also wrecked several anchors for underwater pipelines  although no lines were ruptured  on barrow island  the winds knocked over 30  and several buildings and instruments were damaged  while high waves incurred beach damage to offshore platforms was estimated in the millions of group of 17  people  initially considered rode out the storm on the offshore mackerel island  onshore  officials closed a portion of highway 1  as well as other roads in the ahead of the storm  hundreds of residents in older structures and mobile homes  as well as an aborigine village near onslow  were ordered to evacuate to safer five iron mines were closed during the storm s passage  forcing the 1,500  workers to return the disruptions from the cyclone affected about 340,000  tonnes of lost about 800,000  barrels of lost oil production resulted from closed offshore platforms  oil fields reopened by 14  ashore western australia  olivia produced peak gusts of 257  km h (160  mph  in mardie the station s second-highest  wind gust from a tropical olivia also produced gusts of 267  km h (166  mph  at varanus island  which was the highest wind gust on record in until the higher reading on barrow island during the storm was it broke the previous peak of 259  km h (161  mph  set by cyclone trixie in and was later matched by cyclone vance in the high winds at mardie station damaged the local airport hangar and several farther inland  olivia still produced wind gusts of 158  km h (98  mph  in pannawonica  which damaged many roofs  trees  and power lines  the town s police station and medical center lost their roofs during the and every house sustained some of the 82  houses in the small town  55  lost their roof  it was estimated that pannawonica would remain without power for three weeks  one person in town was injured by flying broken glass  who had to be airlifted to karratha for medical attention  in nearby yarraloola  nearly every building was damaged  and the roofs of several farm buildings were ripped off  several other small towns in the region sustained damage to roofs  power lines  and and a 24  year old roadhouse was destroyed along the fortescue olivia also dropped heavy rainfall  peaking at 167  mm (6.6  in  in red hill  although flooding was not the storm also produced a 2  m (6.6  ft  storm surge in localized at the port of dampier  the storm sank three boats  although no one was damage was estimated in the  millions of dollars   according to a local and overall  10  people were the remnants of olivia moved through australia  they dropped heavy rainfall and brought gusty winds to south australia  cape willoughby recorded gusts of 106  km h (66  mph  on 12  april  strong enough to knock down tree branches on nearby kangaroo at port lincoln  sediment stirred up by olivia s remnants killed 60,000  farmed tuna  worth about a$60  million (us$47.5  million   the fish were in cages and died due to abnormally high oxygen levels in the water  caused by olivia s high winds and rough the remnants of olivia later brought rainfall to the states of victoria and name  olivia  was later retired from the list of tropical cyclone names for the australian after the storm s passage  the royal australian air force flew six generators to pannawonica after the town was out of power for two and the western australian government sent another 13  residents in the town received counseling to cope with the stress of the storm s 10:55  utc on 10  april 1996  along the offshore barrow island  an automatic privately operated anemometer recorded a three-second  wind gust of 408  km h (253  mph   at a position 10  m (33  ft  above sea level  the bom was initially unsure of the veracity of the reading  although a team at the 1999  offshore technology conference presented the reading as the highest wind gust on in 2009,  the world meteorological organization commission for climatology researched whether hurricane gustav in 2008  produced a record 340  km h (211  mph  gust on pinar del rio  one committee member recalled the gust set during olivia  which spurred the investigation  the reading occurred along the western edge of the eyewall  possibly related to mesovortices  based on other similarly high wind gusts during olivia – 369  km h (229  mph  and 374  km h (232  mph  observed within five minutes of the record gust – the team confirmed that the instrument was observing properly during the storm  the same anemometer also recorded five-minute  sustained winds of 178  km h (111  mph   causing a much greater than normal ratio of gusts to sustained winds  the team confirmed that the instrument was regularly inspected and calibrated  and that the reading was during the passage of the 26  january 2010,  nearly 14  years later  the world meteorological organization announced that the wind gust was the highest recorded worldwide  this gust surpassed the previous non-tornadic  wind speed of 372  km h (231  mph  on mount washington in the united states in april the long delay was partly due to the anemometer not being owned by the bom  and as a result the agency did not enact a follow-up  investigation  despite the high winds  the anemometer and a nearby building were not damaged due to the winds occurring over a very short
