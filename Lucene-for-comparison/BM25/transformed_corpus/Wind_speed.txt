 wind speed -  wikipediawind speed  or wind flow velocity  is a fundamental atmospheric quantity wind speed is caused by air moving from high pressure to low pressure  usually due to changes in temperature  note that wind direction is usually almost parallel to isobars  and not perpendicular as one might expect   due to the rotation of the earth wind speed affects weather forecasting  aircraft and maritime operations  construction projects  growth and metabolism rate of many plant species  and countless other speed is now commonly measured with an anemometer but can also be classified using the older beaufort scale which is based on people s observation of specifically defined wind effects wind speed is affected by a number of factors and situations  operating on varying scales  from micro to macro scales   these include the pressure gradient  rossby waves and jet streams  and local weather conditions  there are also links to be found between wind speed and wind direction  notably with the pressure gradient and terrain conditions pressure gradient is a term to describe the difference in air pressure between two points in the atmosphere or on the surface of the earth  it is vital to wind speed  because the greater the difference in pressure  the faster the wind flows  from the high to low pressure  to balance out the variation  the pressure gradient  when combined with the coriolis effect and friction  also influences wind direction rossby waves are strong winds in the upper troposphere  these operate on a global scale and move from west to east  hence being known as westerlies   the rossby waves are themselves a different wind speed from what we experience in the lower troposphere local weather conditions play a key role in influencing wind speed  as the formation of hurricanes  monsoons and cyclones as freak weather conditions can drastically affect the flow velocity of the wind the fastest wind speed not related to tornadoes ever recorded was during the passage of tropical cyclone olivia on 10  april 1996:  an automatic weather station on barrow island  australia  registered a maximum wind gust of 408  km h (220  kn  253  mph  113  the wind gust was evaluated by the wmo evaluation panel who found that the anemometer was mechanically sound and the gust was within statistical probability and ratified the measurement in 2010.  the anemometer was mounted 10  m above ground level  and thus 64  m above sea level   during the cyclone  several extreme gusts of greater than 300  km h (160  kn  83  m s  were recorded  with a maximum 5-minute  mean speed of 176  km h (95  kn  110  mph  49  m s   the extreme gust factor was in the order of 2.27–2.75  times the mean wind speed  the pattern and scales of the gusts suggest that a mesovortex was embedded in the already strong eyewall of the now second highest surface wind speed ever officially recorded is 372  km h (231  mph  103  m s  at the mount washington  new hampshire  observatory  6,288  ft (1917  m  above sea level in the us on 12  april 1934,  using a heated anemometer  the anemometer  specifically designed for use on mount washington was later tested by the us national weather bureau and confirmed to be speeds within certain atmospheric phenomena  such as tornadoes  may greatly exceed these values but have never been accurately measured  directly measuring these tornadic winds is rarely done as the violent wind would destroy the instruments  another method of estimating is to use doppler on wheels to sense the wind speeds the figure of 486  km h (302  mph  135  m s  during the 1999  bridge creek–moore tornado in oklahoma on 3  may 1999  is often quoted as the highest-recorded  surface wind however  another figure of 512  kilometres per hour (318  mph  has also been quoted for the same yet another number used by the center for severe weather research for that measurement is 486  ± 32  km h (302  ± 20  however  speeds measured by doppler radar are not considered official speed is a common factor in the design of structures and buildings around the world  it is often the governing factor in the required lateral strength of a structure s design in the united states  the wind speed used in design is often referred to as a "3-second  gust  which is the highest sustained gust over a 3-second  period having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1  in 50   asce 7-05).  this design wind speed is accepted by most building codes in the united states and often governs the lateral design of buildings and structures in canada  reference wind pressures are used in design and are based on the  mean hourly  wind speed having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1  in 50.  the reference wind pressure  q  is calculated in pascals using the following equation  ref  nbc 2005  structural commentaries -  part 4  of div  b  comm  i   q=(1/2)pv²  where p is the air density in kg m³ and v is wind speed in m s historically  wind speeds have been reported with a variety of averaging times  such as fastest mile  3-second  gust  1-minute  and mean hourly  which designers may have to take into account  to convert wind speeds from one averaging time to another  the durst curve  ref  asce 7-05  commentary figure c6-4,  asce 7-10  c26.5-1)  was developed which defines the relation between probable maximum wind speed averaged over t seconds  vt  and mean wind speed over one hour v3600.
