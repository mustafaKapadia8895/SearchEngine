 placer deposit -  wikipediain geology  a placer deposit or placer is an accumulation of valuable minerals formed by gravity separation during sedimentary processes  the name is from the spanish word placer  meaning  alluvial sand   placer mining is an important source of gold  and was the main technique used in the early years of many gold rushes  including the california gold rush  types of placer deposits include alluvium  eluvium  beach placers  and paleoplacers placer materials must be both dense and resistant to weathering processes  to accumulate in placers  mineral particles must be significantly denser than quartz  whose specific gravity is 2.65),  as quartz is usually the largest component of sand or gravel  placer environments typically contain black sand  a conspicuous shiny black mixture of iron oxides  mostly magnetite with variable amounts of ilmenite and hematite  valuable mineral components often occurring with black sands are monazite  rutile  zircon  chromite  wolframite  and cassiterite substances commercially mined from placer deposits include alluvial placers are those formed in river or stream sediments  typical locations for alluvial gold placer deposits are on the inside bends of rivers and creeks  in natural hollows  at the break of slope on a stream  the base of an escarpment  waterfall or other barrier alluvial placers are formed by the deposition of dense particles at a site where water velocity remains below that required to transport them further to form a placer deposit  the particles desired must show a marked density contrast with the gangue material  which is able to be transported away from the trap site  only if the deposit is winnowed in this way can the minerals be concentrated to economic levels beach placers are formed in sand and gravel deposited along the edge of large bodies of water
