 2003  atlantic hurricane season -  wikipediathe 2003  atlantic hurricane season was an active atlantic hurricane season with tropical activity before and after the official bounds of the season – the first such occurrence in 49  years  the season produced 21  tropical cyclones  of which 16  developed into named storms  seven cyclones attained hurricane status  of which three reached major hurricane status  with sixteen storms  the season was tied for the sixth most active atlantic hurricane season on record  the strongest hurricane of the season was hurricane isabel  which reached category 5  status on the saffir-simpson  hurricane scale northeast of the lesser antilles  isabel later struck north carolina as a category 2  hurricane  causing $3.6  billion in damage (2003  usd  $4.69  billion 2017  usd  and a total of 51  deaths across the mid-atlantic  region of the united states the season began with subtropical storm ana on april 20,  prior to the official start of the season  the bounds of the season are from june 1  to november 30,  which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the atlantic basin  in early september  hurricane fabian struck bermuda as a category 3  hurricane  where it was the worst hurricane since 1926;  on the island it caused four deaths and $300  million in damage (2003  usd  $391  million 2017  usd   hurricane juan caused considerable destruction to nova scotia  particularly halifax  as a category 2  hurricane  the first hurricane of significant strength to hit the province since 1893.  additionally  hurricanes claudette and erika struck texas and mexico  respectively  as minimal hurricanes on may 19,  prior to the start of the season  noaa forecasters issued a 55%  probability of above normal activity  the forecasters predicted 11–15  tropical storms  6–9  of those becoming hurricanes  and 2–4  of those hurricanes reaching at least category 3  strength on the saffir-simpson  hurricane scale  the above normal activity predicted was due to the likelihood of la niña developing in the hurricane expert dr  william m  gray on april 4  predicted twelve named storms  with eight reaching hurricane strength and three of the eight reaching category 3  the prediction issued on may 30  was similar  increasing the named storms to fourteen  the synoptic pattern of the season prior to june 1  resembled other previous seasons  with the 1952,  1954,  1964,  1966,  and 1998  seasons considered the best analogs for the season  the prediction also included a 68%  probability for a hurricane landfall along the united august 6,  dr  gray announced he had maintained his previous prediction  with an active start of the season  the rest of the season was forecast to have been only slightly above average  due to an anticipated overall less favorable environment across the atlantic a day later  noaa released an updated prediction as well  with a 60%  probability of above normal activity  with 12–15  named storms  7–9  hurricanes  and 3–4  major hurricanes normal season  as defined by noaa  has 6–14  tropical storms  4–8  of which reach hurricane strength  and 1–3  of those reaching category 3  official beginning of the season was on june 1,  though subtropical storm ana formed on april 20,  well before the start to the starting at the official start of the season  the national hurricane center began issuing five-day  forecasts  extending from the three-day  forecasts issued since 1964.  officials conducted tests during the previous two seasons  indicating the new five-day  forecasts would be as accurate as the three-day  forecasts were 15  years the tropics were active and well ahead of climatology in the early portion of the season  with the seventh tropical depression forming by the end of the season officially ended on november 30,  although tropical storms odette and peter developed in early season is one of only six with a storm before and after the official bounds of the season  the others are 1887,  1951,  1953,  1954  and 2007.  when tropical storm peter formed on december 7,  the season became the second on record with two december storms  the 235  days between the development of the first storm  tropical storm ana  and the dissipation of the last storm  peter  made the 2003  season the longest season since 1952.  the season was the eighth most active on record  behind the 2005,  1933,  2012,  2011,  2010,  1995,  1887,  and 1969  seasons  and tied with the 1936  and 2008  cyclones in the season had a significant impact on south america or central america  however  a total of eight tropical cyclones made landfall on mexico from either the atlantic or the pacific ocean  which was the greatest total since the record of nine in 1971.  a total of seven deaths occurred in mexico from atlantic hurricanes  much of the caribbean did not receive significant impact from tropical cyclones during the tropical cyclones made landfall along the coast of the united states during the season  including two hurricanes  the first  claudette  caused locally heavy damage in southeastern texas in july  two deaths were reported in the state  while earlier in its duration it caused an indirect death from rough waves in in september  hurricane isabel caused deaths and damage from north carolina through southern the worst damage from the hurricane occurred in virginia  where it was the costliest disaster in the history of the there  damage totaled $1.85  billion (2003  usd  $2.41  billion 2017  usd   and there were 32  fatalities  ten of which were caused directly by the hurricane isabel caused deaths in seven states and one canadian province  and about 6  million people were left without power as a result of the cyclones impacted bermuda during the season  most significantly hurricane fabian  on the island  its passage proved to be the costliest and resulted in the first death since a hurricane in the hurricane killed four on the island when its strong waves and storm surge washed two cars off the causeway between st  george s parish and st  david s damage from the hurricane totaled $300  million (2003  usd  $391  million 2017  elsewhere  hurricane juan was considered among the most damaging in the history of halifax  nova scotia  where strong winds downed thousands of trees and left low-lying  areas flooded from a record storm surge to the city  the hurricane caused a total of eight deaths and damage estimated at $200  million (2003  cad  $150  million 2003  usd  $195  million 2017  non-tropical  low pressure area developed about 240  mi (390  km  south-southwest  of bermuda on april 18  through the interaction of an upper-level  trough and a surface frontal trough  it tracked northwestward at first  then turned to the southeast  after developing centralized convection  the system developed into subtropical storm ana on april 20  to the west of bermuda  it tracked east-southeastward  and organized  and on april 21  it transitioned into a tropical cyclone with peak winds of 60  mph (95  km h   after developing an upper-level  warm core  increased wind shear caused fluctuations in intensity and a steady weakening trend  and on april 24  the center of ana merged with an approaching cold front  thus signaling the completion of extratropical transition  the extratropical remnants continued east-northeastward,  and on april 27  the gale was absorbed within the cold cyclone is most notable for being the only atlantic tropical cyclone in the month of april  until tropical storm arlene in 2017.  when ana became a subtropical storm  it became the second subtropical cyclone on record in the month  after a storm in ana dropped 2.63  in (67  mm  of rainfall in bermuda over a period of several increased swells from the storm caused two drowning deaths in southeastern florida when a boat the remnants of the storm brought light rainfall to the azores and the united kingdom  though no significant damage was tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on june tracking westward at a low latitude  a disturbance along the wave axis became better organized on june with reasonable favorable environmental conditions despite the time of year  initially lacking a well-defined  low-level  convection increased further on june 10,  and the system was declared tropical depression two early on june 11  in the central tropical atlantic the depression was at the time the third tropical cyclone on record to develop in the month of june to the east of the lesser the others were tropical depression two in ana in 1979,  and a storm in the next such system to accomplish this would be bret in 2017.initially,  the depression was forecast to attain tropical storm status  maintaining good outflow and some banding features around the around 0900  utc on june 11  satellite-based  intensity estimates indicated the depression was near tropical storm however  the convection subsequently diminished and became displaced to the northeast of the center  and late on june 11  the depression degenerated into an open tropical wave about 950  mi (1535  km  east-southeast  of the tropical wave remained well-defined  with a well-defined  low-level  vorticity  though strong wind shear prevented tropical on june 13  its remnants passed through the lesser antilles  and the wave continued westward through the caribbean storm bill developed from a tropical wave on june 29  to the north of the yucatán peninsula  it slowly organized as it moved northward  and reached a peak of 60  mph (95  km h  shortly before making landfall 27  mi (43  km  west of chauvin  louisiana  bill quickly weakened over land  and as it accelerated to the northeast  moisture from the storm  combined with cold air from an approaching cold front  produced an outbreak of 34  tornadoes  bill became extratropical on july 2,  and was absorbed by the cold front later that making landfall on louisiana  the storm produced a moderate storm surge  causing tidal in a city in the northeastern portion of the state  the surge breached a levee  which flooded many homes in the moderate winds combined with wet soil knocked down trees  which then hit a few houses and power and left hundreds of thousands without electric further inland  tornadoes from the storm produced localized moderate damage  throughout its path  tropical storm bill caused around $50  million in damage (2003  usd  $65.1  million 2017  usd  and four well-organized  tropical wave tracked quickly through the lesser antilles on july 7,  producing tropical storm force winds but failing to attain a low-level  circulation  after organizing in the caribbean sea  it developed into tropical storm claudette to the south of the dominican republic on july 8.  its intensity fluctuated over the subsequent days  attaining hurricane status briefly on july 10  before weakening and hitting puerto morelos on the yucatán peninsula on july 11  as a tropical storm  the storm remained disorganized due to moderate wind shear  though after turning west-northwestward  into an area of lighter shear  it re-attained  hurricane status on july 15  off the coast of texas  it intensified quickly and made landfall on matagorda island with peak winds of 90  mph (145  km h   it slowly weakened after moving ashore  tracking across northern tamaulipas before dissipating in northwestern precursor cyclone caused light damage in the lesser antilles  and waves from the hurricane caused an indirect death off of widespread flooding and gusty winds destroyed or severely damaged 412  buildings in southeast texas  with a further 1,346  buildings suffering lighter impact  the hurricane caused locally severe beach erosion along the high winds downed many trees along the coast  causing one direct and one indirect death  damage was estimated at $180  million (2003  usd  $234  million 2017  tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on july 9.  the northern portion of the wave tracked to the west-northwest,  and on july 13  an area of convection developed along the wave axis  the system slowly organized  and after a closed low-level  circulation developed  the system was classified as tropical depression five about 630  mi (1020  km  east of bermuda  it quickly organized  becoming tropical storm danny a day after forming  tracking around the periphery of an anticyclone  the storm moved northwestward before turning north and later northeastward  despite being located at a high latitude  danny continued to strengthen due to unusually warm water temperatures  and on july 19  it attained hurricane status about 525  mi (850  km  south of st  john s  newfoundland and labrador  despite having an unusually high minimum pressure for a storm of its shear increased the next day as the hurricane turned eastward  causing a steady weakening trend that was accelerated after crossing into an area of cooler water temperatures  by july 20  the cyclone had turned to the southeast and weakened to tropical depression status  and on july 21  it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area  the remnants of danny tracked erratically southwestward before dissipating on july 27  about 630  mi (1015  km  east of where it originally developed  there were no reports of damages or casualties associated with tropical wave moved westward off the coast of africa on july after tracking steadily westward  an area of thunderstorms became more concentrated as its upper-level  environment became more and late on july 19  the national hurricane center classified it as tropical depression six while it was located about 1035  mi (1675  km  east of the lesser upon being classified as a tropical cyclone  the depression maintained two ill-defined  hooking bands to its north and south  and was originally forecast to attain hurricane status before passing through the lesser antilles  with warm waters and very light wind shear forecast  its environmental conditions met four out of five parameters for rapid subsequently  convection diminished as the result of cold air inflow and instability from a disturbance to its a fast forward speed  confirmation of a low-level  circulation on july 20  became convection increased in curvature on july and several islands in the lesser antilles issued tropical storm warnings and watches  after it passed north of barbados  a hurricane hunters flight failed to report a closed low-level  circulation  and it is estimated the depression degenerated into an open tropical wave late on july 21.  the remnants brought a few showers to the lesser and after tracking into the caribbean sea redevelopment was prevented by increased wind the northern portion of the wave axis split and developed into tropical depression tropical wave interacted with an upper-level  low to develop an area of deep convection near hispaniola on july a mid-  to lower-level  circulation developed within the system at it tracked generally north-northwestward,  and based on surface and satellite observations  it is estimated the system developed into tropical depression seven at 1200  utc on july 25  about 60  mi (95  km  east of daytona beach  florida  the system was embedded in an environment characterized by high surface pressures  tracking through an area of cool water as well as unfavorable upper-level  winds  the depression failed to achieve winds greater than 35  mph (55  on july 26  it moved ashore on st  catherines island  georgia  and after steadily weakening over land it dissipated on july 27.  as the storm was never forecast to attain tropical storm status  no tropical storm warnings or watches were however  flood watches were posted for much of georgia and south the depression dropped light to moderate rainfall from florida to the coast of north carolina  peaking at 5.17  in (131  mm  in savannah  georgia  mostly  rainfall totals between 1  and 3  inches (25  and 76  mm  were there were no reports of damage or casualties associated with this precursor system to hurricane erika was first observed as a non-tropical  low on august 9  about 1150  mi (1860  km  east of bermuda  it tracked quickly southwestward then westward in tandem with an upper-level  low  which prevented tropical development  on august 13  an area of convection increased as it passed through the bahamas  and while crossing florida a circulation built toward the surface  it is estimated the system developed into tropical storm erika on august 14  about 85  mi (140  km  west-southwest  of fort myers  florida  a strong ridge caused the storm to continue quickly westward  and the system gradually strengthened and organized  by august 15  its forward motion slowed  allowing the convection to organize into curved rainbands  and late in the day an eye feature began developing  tropical storm erika attained hurricane status at around 1030  utc as it was moving ashore in northeastern tamaulipas  operationally it was not classified as a hurricane  due to lack of data  the winds rapidly decreased as it tracked across the mountainous terrain of northeastern mexico  and early on august 17  the cyclone hurricane dropped light to moderate rainfall along its path  which caused some flooding  in montemorelos in nuevo león  two people died after being swept away by floodwaters  several mudslides were reported  which left numerous highways blocked or impassable  in southern texas  the hurricane caused light winds and minor damage  with no reports of deaths or injuries in the united strong tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on august and after tracking steadily westward an area of convection began to become better organized on august after it tracked through the lesser antilles  it developed into tropical depression nine on august 21  to the south of puerto rico  the depression quickly showed signs of organization  and forecasters predicted the depression to intensify to a strong tropical however  strong southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly became established over the system  and the depression degenerated into a tropical wave late on august 22  to the south of the eastern tip of the dominican remnants of the depression dropped light to moderate precipitation in the dominican republic  which caused flooding and overflown rivers  more than 100  houses were flooded  and some crop damage was the rainfall was welcome in the country  as conditions were dry in the preceding flooding was also reported in eastern jamaica  though damage there  if any  is august 25,  a tropical wave emerged off the coast of africa  and two days later developed enough organized convection to develop into tropical depression ten  tracking through warm waters and low vertical shear  the depression was named tropical storm fabian on august 28.  on august 30,  the storm intensified into a hurricane  and it quickly strengthened to attain major hurricane status late that day  on september 1  fabian reached its peak intensity of 145  mph (230  km h   the hurricane turned to the north and gradually weakened before passing 14  mi (23  km  west of bermuda on september 5  with winds of 115  mph (180  km h   the cyclone accelerated northeastward into an environment of unfavorable conditions  becoming an extratropical cyclone on september 8;  two days later it merged with another extratropical storm between southern greenland and waves caused extensive damage to the bermuda destroying 10  nests of the endangered bermuda the storm surge from the hurricane stranded one vehicle with three police officers and another with a resident on the causeway between st  george s parish and st  david s island  later washing both vehicles into castle all four were strong winds left about 25,000  people without power on the island  and also caused severe damage to the strong winds damaged or destroyed the roofs of numerous buildings on damage on the island totaled $300  million (2003  usd  $391  million 2017  usd   elsewhere  strong waves from the hurricane killed a surfer in north carolina and caused three deaths off of newfoundland when a fishing vessel strong tropical wave accompanied with a low pressure system moved off the coast of africa on august 19.  it moved quickly westward  failing to organize significantly  and developed a surface low pressure area on august 29  in the gulf of mexico  convection continued to organize  and the tropical wave developed into tropical depression eleven on august 30  while located 335  mi (540  km  east-southeast  of corpus christi  texas  the depression quickly intensified to become tropical storm grace  though further intensification was limited due to a nearby upper-level  low  on august 31,  grace moved ashore on galveston island  texas  and it quickly weakened over land  the storm turned northeastward and was absorbed by a cold front over extreme eastern oklahoma on september storm produced light to moderate precipitation from texas through the eastern united states  peaking at 10.4  in (263  mm  in eastern near where it made landfall  grace produced flooding of low-lying  areas and light beach in oklahoma and southern missouri  the remnants of the storm caused localized no deaths were reported  and damage was august 22,  a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa  and it remained disorganized until reaching the eastern gulf of mexico on september 1.  a tropical disturbance developed into tropical depression twelve on september 3  about 300  mi (480  km  west of tampa  florida  it moved eastward and strengthened into tropical storm henri on september 5,  and despite strong wind shear it intensified to reach peak winds of 60  mph (95  km h  later that day  subsequently  it quickly weakened  and it struck the western florida coast as a tropical depression  on september 8  it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area off the coast of north and after moving ashore near cape it crossed the mid-atlantic  states and dissipated on september 17  over new was responsible for locally heavy rainfall across florida  but damage was the remnants of henri caused heavy precipitation in delaware and pennsylvania  causing $19.6  million in damage (2003  usd  $24.7  million 2017  in delaware  the rainfall caused record-breaking  river flooding  with part of the red clay creek experiencing a 500-year  and the system left 109,000  residents without power in the impacts of the storm were severely compounded the following week by hurricane isabel across the region a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 1,  which developed into tropical depression thirteen early on september 6  to the southwest of the cape verde islands  it quickly intensified into tropical storm and it continued to gradually intensify within an area of light wind shear and warm isabel strengthened to a hurricane on september 7,  and the following day it attained major hurricane status  its intensity fluctuated over the subsequent days as it passed north of the lesser antilles  and it attained peak winds of 165  mph (270  km h  on september 11,  a category 5  hurricane on the saffir-simpson  scale  the hurricane oscillated between category 4  and category 5  status over the following four days  before weakening due to wind shear  on september 18  isabel made landfall between cape lookout and ocracoke island in north carolina with winds of 105  mph (165  km h   it continued northwestward  becoming extratropical over western pennsylvania before being absorbed by a larger storm over ontario on september winds from isabel extended from north carolina to new england and westward to west virginia  the winds  combined with previous rainfall which moistened the soil  downed many trees and power lines across its path  leaving about 6  million electricity customers without power at some point  coastal areas suffered from waves and its powerful storm surge  with areas in eastern north carolina and southeast virginia reporting severe damage from both winds and the storm surge  throughout its path  isabel resulted in $3.6  billion in damage (2003  usd  $4.69  billion 2017  usd  and 47  deaths  of which 16  were directly related to the storm s governors of pennsylvania  west virginia  maryland  new jersey  and delaware declared states of isabel was the first major hurricane to threaten the mid-atlantic  states and the south since hurricane floyd in september 1999.  isabel s greatest impact was due to flood damage  the worst in some areas of virginia since 1972's  hurricane agnes  more than 60  million people were affected to some degree — a similar number to floyd but more than any other hurricane in recent strong tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 6,  and almost immediately it became associated with a broad surface with favorable upper-level  winds the system quickly became better and on september 8  it possessed enough organization to be classified as tropical depression fourteen while located about 290  mi (465  km  southeast of the southernmost cape verde initially the depression failed to maintain an inner core of deep convection  and despite its occurrence with nearby dry air  the depression was forecast to intensify to hurricane status due to anticipated favorable the hours subsequent to formation  the convection near the center decreased as the banding features dry air greatly increased over the depression  and by september 9  the system was not forecast to intensify past minimal tropical storm later that day an upper-level  low tracked southward to the west of the depression  which increased wind shear and caused a steady north-northwest  motion for the depression  the circulation became elongated and separated from the convection as it passed just west of the cape verde where it brought heavy and on september 10  the depression large tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september and due to unfavorable wind shear it initially remained an area of convection increased in association with an upper-level  low  and it developed into tropical depression fifteen on september 24  to the southeast of bermuda  it steadily organized as it tracked northward  intensifying into tropical storm juan on september 25  and attaining hurricane status on september with warm waters and light wind shear  juan reached peak winds of 105  mph (165  km h  on september 27  about 635  mi (1,020  km  south of halifax  nova it accelerated northward  weakening only slightly before moving ashore near halifax on september 29  with winds of 100  mph (160  km h   it quickly weakened while crossing the southern canadian maritimes before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone over the gulf of saint eyewall of hurricane juan was the first to directly cross over halifax since a hurricane in august of 1893;  the cyclone became one of the most damaging tropical cyclones in modern history for the city  the hurricane produced a record storm surge of 4.9  ft (1.5  m   which resulted in extensive flooding of the halifax and dartmouth waterfront properties  strong winds caused widespread occurrences of falling trees  downed power lines  and damaged houses  and the hurricane was responsible for four direct deaths and four indirect more than 800,000  people were left without power  nearly all wind-related  damage occurred to the east of the storm track  and damage amounted to about $200  million (2003  cad  $150  million 2003  usd  $260  million 2017  developed from a tropical wave in the central tropical atlantic on september 25.  the storm moved northwestward until a weakness in the subtropical ridge forced it eastward  kate strengthened to a hurricane  turned sharply westward while moving around a mid-level  low  and intensified to a 125  mph (205  km h  major hurricane on october 4.  kate turned sharply northward around the periphery of an anticyclone  weakened  and became extratropical after passing to the east of newfoundland  the extratropical storm persisted for three days until losing its identity near threatened atlantic canada just one week after hurricane juan caused severe damage in nova scotia  the storm had minimal effects on land  limited to moderately strong winds and heavy rainfall over st  john s reported 1.8  in (45  mm  on october 6,  a record for the the interaction between kate and a high pressure area to its north produced three to four ft  one m  waves along the coast of north carolina and new tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 17,  which developed a low pressure area on september 27  in the western caribbean sea  it moved ashore along the yucatán peninsula on september 29  and developed into an extratropical cyclone as it interacted with a stationary cold front  deep convection increased  and it transitioned into tropical storm larry by october 1.  the storm drifted generally southward  and after reaching peak winds of 65  mph (100  km h  it made landfall in the mexican state of tabasco on october the first landfall in the state since hurricane brenda in the remnants of larry crossed the isthmus of tehuantepec  degenerating into a remnant low pressure area before dissipating on october 7  in the eastern pacific storm dropped heavy rainfall  peaking at 24.77  inches (629.2  mm  in upper juarez in southeastern the rainfall caused mudslides and damage  which coincided with the presence of two other tropical cyclones – eastern pacific tropical storm nora and overall  the storm resulted in five deaths and $53.4  million in damage (2003  tropical wave exited the coast of africa on october 1  and moved on october 8,  thunderstorms spread across the lesser antilles  and the wave slowly rainfall reached 2.98  in (75  mm  in christiansted in saint croix  and 7.13  in (181  mm  near ponce  puerto strong winds left around 29,000  people without power in northeastern puerto the rainfall wrecked bridges in las piedras and and led to flooded streams  downed trees  and rockslides that closed four roads  one car was swept and a few houses were the damage total was at least $46,000  (2003  turned northwestward through a weakness in the subtropical ridge  and despite strong wind shear developed into tropical storm mindy late on october 10  over eastern dominican republic  with peak winds of 45  mph (75  it produced 2.63  in (60  mm  of rain in santiago rodríguez  which caused flooding and damaged 320  although forecast to intensify to 65  mph (105  km h  winds  the storm weakened due to the wind the center passed near the turks and caicos islands on october and winds reached only 31  mph (50  km h  at grand turk on october 12,  mindy weakened to a tropical depression  and later turned eastward due to an approaching short-wave  trough  devoid of deep convection  the circulation dissipated on october 14  about 445  mi (715  km  south-southwest  of mindy produced two to three ft (0.6  to 0.9  m  swells along the u s  atlantic coast from florida through north from a tropical wave on october 13  in the central tropical atlantic ocean  nicholas slowly developed due to moderate levels of wind shear throughout its lifetime  deep convection slowly organized  and nicholas attained a peak intensity of 70  mph (110  km h  on october 17.  after moving west-northwestward  for much of its lifetime  it turned northward and weakened due to increasing shear  the storm again turned to the west and briefly restrengthened  but after turning again to the north nicholas transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on october 24.  as an extratropical storm  nicholas executed a large loop to the west  and after moving erratically for a week and organizing into a tropical low  it was absorbed by a non-tropical  low  the low continued westward  crossed florida  and ultimately dissipated over the gulf coast of the united states on november had no impact as a tropical cyclone  and impact from the low that absorbed the storm was limited to rainfall  gusty winds  and rough the low that absorbed the storm nearly developed into a tropical cyclone  which would have been called odette  however  moderate wind shear prevented further was a rare december tropical storm  the first since hurricane lili in 1984,  that formed on december 4  in the southwest caribbean it became the second december tropical storm on record to form in the caribbean sea  after a hurricane in odette strengthened and made landfall near cabo falso in the dominican republic on december 6  as a moderately strong tropical storm  a day later  odette became extratropical  and eventually merged with a cold deaths were directly attributed to this tropical storm in the dominican republic due to mudslides or flash flooding  in addition  two deaths were indirectly caused by the storm  approximately 35%  of the nation s banana crop was light to moderate rainfall was reported in puerto december 5,  an extratropical cyclone developed and was moving southward  isolated from the westerlies  convection developed near the center  and the system organized into a subtropical storm late on december 7,  about 835  mi (1340  km  south-southwest  of the azores  the system moved southwestward over warmer waters  and deep convection continued to organize over the center  banding features also increased  and the national hurricane center declared the system as tropical storm peter on december 9,  about 980  mi (1580  km  northwest of the cape verde islands  with the development of peter and odette  2003  became the first year since 1887  that two storms developed in the month of the national hurricane center did not anticipate however  peter intensified to winds of 70  mph (110  km h  late on december 9,  after an eye feature developed  usually that would indicate hurricane intensity  but as the eye was short-lived,  peter remained a tropical storm  it turned northward ahead of the same frontal system that absorbed tropical storm odette  and the combination of strong upper-level  winds and cooler water temperatures caused quick weakening  by december 10,  peter degenerated into a tropical depression  and after turning northeastward it was absorbed by the cold front the next is a table of all of the storms that have formed during the 2003  atlantic hurricane season  it includes their names  duration  peak strength  areas affected  damage  and death totals  deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect  an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident   but were still related to that storm  damage and deaths include totals while
