 2017  atlantic hurricane season -  wikipediathe 2017  atlantic hurricane season is an ongoing event in the annual formation of tropical cyclones in the atlantic basin  the season has been featuring 17  named storms  making it tied with 1936  as the fifth-most  active season since reliable records began in 1851  and featuring both the highest total accumulated cyclone energy  ace  and the highest number of major hurricanes since the 2005  season  it has the greatest number of consecutive hurricanes in the satellite era  with franklin through ophelia all reaching winds of at least 75  mph (120  km h   in addition  it has thus far been a very destructive season  the most destructive season on record  with a preliminary total of over $316.51  billion  usd  in damages  nearly all of which was due to three of the major hurricanes of the season — harvey  irma  and maria  this season is also one of only six years on record to feature multiple category 5  hurricanes  irma s landfalls on multiple caribbean islands and maria s landfall on dominica make 2017  the second season on record  after 2007)  to feature two hurricanes making landfall at category 5  intensity  in addition  irma was the strongest hurricane ever recorded to form in the atlantic ocean outside of the gulf of mexico and caribbean this season is the only season on record in which three hurricanes each had an ace of over 40:  irma  jose  and maria the season officially began on june 1  and will end on november 30.  these dates historically describe the period of year when most tropical cyclones form in the atlantic basin and are adopted by convention  however  as shown by tropical storm arlene in april  the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at other times of the year  arlene also marked 2017  the third consecutive year to feature a pre-season  storm  in mid-june,  tropical storm bret struck the island of trinidad  which is only rarely struck by tropical cyclones due to its low latitude  a few days later  tropical storm cindy struck the state of louisiana  in late august  hurricane harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005,  while also setting the record for the costliest tropical cyclone on record  as well as the most rainfall dropped by a tropical cyclone in the us  in early september  hurricane irma  a cape verde-type  hurricane  became the first category 5  hurricane to impact the northern leeward islands on record  as well as equaling the strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the atlantic basin—the 1935  labor day hurricane  with hurricane maria striking puerto rico as a high-end  category 4,  the season was the first on record to feature three atlantic hurricanes making landfall anywhere in the united states or one of its territories at category 4  intensity or stronger  the season also featured the fastest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the gulf of mexico  nate   this was the first season to have three hurricanes make landfall in the mainland united states  harvey  irma  and nate  since 2008,  and the first season to feature four hurricanes making landfall in the overall united states  harvey  irma  maria  and nate  since 2005.  the season also featured ophelia  the easternmost major hurricane in the basin on record  which later became the costliest hurricane to affect the united kingdom and ireland in history  for the first time since 2013,  a named storm formed in every month of the season  june to november  beginning in 2017,  the national hurricane center  nhc  has the option to issue advisories  and thus allow watches and warnings to be issued  on disturbances that are not yet tropical cyclones but have a high chance to become one  and are expected to bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to landmasses within 48  hours  such systems are termed  potential tropical cyclones   advisories on these storms contain the same content  including track forecasts and cyclone watches and warnings  as advisories on active tropical the first storm to receive this designation was potential tropical cyclone two  which later developed into tropical storm bret  east-southeast  of the windward islands on june in addition  the numbering that a potential tropical cyclone receives would be retained for the rest of the hurricane season  meaning that the next tropical system would be designated with the following number  even though potential tropical cyclones do not qualify as tropical cyclones  this was first demonstrated with potential tropical cyclone ten  which failed to develop into a tropical cyclone ahead of and during the season  several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms  hurricanes and major  category 3  or higher on the saffir–simpson scale  hurricanes will form during a season and or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country  these agencies include the tropical storm risk  tsr  consortium of the university college london  the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa  and colorado state university  csu   the forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms  hurricanes  and major hurricanes within a particular some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the dissipation of the 2014–16  el niño event  on average  an atlantic hurricane season between 1981  and 2010  contained twelve tropical storms  six hurricanes  and two major hurricanes  with an accumulated cyclone energy  ace  index of between 66  and 103  first forecast for the year was issued by tsr on december 13,  they anticipated that the 2017  season would be a near-average  season  with a prediction of 14  named storms  6  hurricanes  and 3  major hurricanes  they also predicted an ace index of around 101  on december 14,  csu released a qualitative discussion detailing five possible scenarios for the 2017  season  taking into account the state of the atlantic multidecadal oscillation and the possibility of el niño developing during the tsr lowered their forecast numbers on april 5,  2017  to 11  named storms  4  hurricanes  and 2  major hurricanes  based on recent trends favoring the development of el the next day  csu released their prediction  also predicting a total of 11  named storms  4  hurricanes  and 2  major on april 17,  the weather company released their forecasts  calling for 2017  to be a near-average  season  with a total of 12  named storms  6  hurricanes  and 2  major the next day  on april 18,  north carolina state university released their prediction  also predicting a near-average  season  with a total of 11–15  named storms  4–6  hurricanes  and 1–3  major on may 20,  the weather company issued an updated forecast  raising their numbers to 14  named storms  7  hurricanes  and 3  major hurricanes to account for tropical storm arlene as well as the decreasing chance of el niño forming during the on may 25,  noaa released their prediction  citing a 70%  chance of an above average season due to  a weak or nonexistent el niño   calling for 11–17  named storms  5–9  hurricanes  and 2–4  major on may 26,  tsr updated its prediction to around the same numbers as its december 2016  prediction  with only a minor change in the expected ace index amount to 98  updated their forecast on june 1  to include 14  named storms  6  hurricanes  and 2  major hurricanes  to include tropical storm it was based on the current status of the north atlantic oscillation  which was showing signs of leaning towards a negative phase  favoring a warmer tropical atlantic  and the chances of el niño forming were significantly lower  however  they stressed on the uncertainty that the el niño–southern oscillation could be in a warm-neutral  phase or weak el niño conditions by the peak of the on the same day  the united kingdom met office  ukmo  released its forecast of a very slightly above-average  season  it predicted 13  named storms  with a 70%  chance that the number would be in the range between 10  and 16,  and 8  hurricanes  with a 70%  chance that the number would be in the range between 6  and 10.  it also predicted an ace index of 145,  with a 70%  chance that the index would be between 92  and on july 4,  tsr released their fourth forecast for the season  increasing their predicted numbers to 17  named storms  7  hurricanes  and 3  major hurricanes  due to the fact that el niño conditions would no longer develop by the peak of the season and the warming of sea-surface  temperatures across the basin  additionally  they predicted a revised ace index of 116  during august 9,  noaa released their final outlook for the season  raising their predictions to 14–19  named storms  though retaining 5–9  hurricanes and 2–5  major hurricanes  they also stated that the season had the potential to be extremely active  possibly the most active since atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1,  2017,  although activity began earlier for the third consecutive year since 2015.  roughly a month before the official start  the first storm  arlene  developed on april 19  in the northern atlantic ocean  it was the first named storm to develop in the month of april since ana in 2003.  in june  two more tropical storms developed  bret  which affected areas in the southeastern caribbean sea  including trinidad and tobago  and cindy  which formed in the gulf of mexico less than a day after bret had developed  in july  a tropical depression developed in the main development region  mdr   the second tropical cyclone to develop in the mdr before the month of august  after bret  and was followed by tropical storm don  at the end of that month  a cold front stalled over the gulf of mexico and portions of the southeastern united states  spawning tropical depression six  which quickly developed into tropical storm featured the season s first hurricane  franklin  which formed in the bay of campeche  a few days after franklin dissipated  tropical storm gert formed northeast of the bahamas  eventually becoming a hurricane at a high latitude over the western atlantic  on august 17,  tropical storm harvey formed east of the windward islands  before opening up into a wave over the central caribbean three days later  harvey then regenerated into a tropical depression over the southwestern gulf of mexico on august 23,  and rapidly strengthened into a category 4  hurricane before making landfall near rockport  texas  late on august 25.  harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005,  the first category 4  hurricane to make landfall in texas since carla in 1961,  and the first category 4  hurricane landfall in the contiguous united states since charley in featured copious activity  irma formed in the eastern atlantic and rapidly intensified into a category 5  hurricane east of the leeward islands  irma is the strongest hurricane in terms of sustained winds since wilma in 2005,  and the strongest hurricane outside of the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico on record  while irma impacted the northern leeward islands  hurricane jose formed on september 5,  peaking as a high-end  category 4  hurricane before weakening and making an anti-cyclonic  loop in the northern atlantic ocean  when katia formed  2017  became the first year since 1998  in which six hurricanes have formed in a on september 17,  maria became a category 5  hurricane  threatening the same areas devastated by hurricane irma  when lee intensified into a major hurricane on september 27,  it became the first time in seven years that five major hurricanes formed  activity briefly paused as september came to a close activity resumed on october 4,  when tropical depression sixteen formed in the southwestern caribbean sea  which strengthened into tropical storm nate on the next day as it neared the coast of nicaragua  nate strengthened to a hurricane on october 7,  and made two landfalls in the united states as a category 1  hurricane -  the first near the mouth of the mississippi river in southeastern louisiana late on october 7  and the second near biloxi  mississippi early october 8.  as nate became a post-tropical  cyclone on october 9,  tropical depression seventeen formed in the eastern subtropical atlantic  strengthening into tropical storm ophelia that same day  ophelia became a hurricane two days later  marking the first time since 1893  that 10  consecutive named storms strengthened into hurricanes  on october 14,  ophelia unexpectedly strengthened into a major hurricane  becoming the sixth major hurricane of the season and the easternmost major hurricane in the atlantic basin on record  after this  the basin went quiet for some time  late in the month  tropical storm philippe formed south of cuba the accumulated cyclone energy  ace  index for the 2017  atlantic hurricane season  as of 21:00  utc on november 7,  is 221.8525  2]  which is one of the highest values on record for an atlantic hurricane season as well as the most since 2005,  and more than double the 1981–2010  full-season  median of 92  units  with an ace value under 4  units following the dissipation of emily  2017  set the record for lowest ace produced by a season s first five named despite that  the 2017  season hosted the storm with the third-highest  ace value  hurricane irma  at 66.6  units  and is one of only four seasons  including 1966,  2003,  and 2004)  to have at least two hurricanes with an ace value over 40  and the only season to have had 2017  also hosted the day with the most ace produced  september 8)  and currently has the fourth highest ace value of any atlantic season since september also generated the highest ace value for any month in the atlantic  surpassing september ace is  broadly speaking  a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed  so storms that last a long time  as well as particularly strong hurricanes  have high aces  it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39  mph (63  km h   which is tropical storm strength a potent extratropical cyclone formed well east of bermuda on april 16.  the cyclone moved southeast  becoming disconnected from the surrounding environment and gradually losing its frontal characteristics  deep convection formed in bands north and east of the center by 00:00  utc on april 19,  leading to the formation of a subtropical depression  despite an unfavorable environment  with ocean temperatures near 20  °c (68  °f  and moderate wind shear  convection coalesced near the center and allowed the subtropical depression to become fully tropical by 00:00  utc on april 20.  it intensified into tropical storm arlene six hours later  after attaining peak winds of 50  mph (85  km h   the storm began to rotate around a larger extratropical low  the storm tracked into the cold sector of the cyclone  causing arlene to lose tropical characteristics around 12:00  utc on april 21.  the post-tropical  cyclone moved south and east  before dissipating well west-southwest  of the azores on april its formation as a subtropical depression on april 19,  arlene was the sixth known subtropical or tropical cyclone to form in the month of april in the atlantic basin  the other instances were ana in 2003,  a subtropical storm in april 1992,  and three tropical depressions in 1912,  1915,  and 1973,  respectively  when arlene became a tropical storm on april 20,  this marked only the second such occurrence on record  after ana in 3]  furthermore  it had the lowest central pressure of any atlantic storm recorded in the month of april  with a central pressure of 990  mbar  hpa  29.23  inhg   again surpassing additionally  unrelated to arlene  tropical storm adrian in the eastern pacific basin also formed before the corresponding hurricane season was set to officially begin  being the earliest named storm in the eastern pacific proper  this makes 2017  the second consecutive year after 2016  where the first storms in both basins were pre-season  tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on june 13  and was first monitored by the national hurricane center shortly development  however  was expected to be slow due to its low latitude and relatively fast motion  as it moved swiftly across the main development region of the atlantic ocean  the disturbance began to gradually organize  and the nhc raised development chances slightly on june little change in organization occurred until june 18,  at which point a burst of convection near the center of the disturbance prompted the nhc to designate the system as potential tropical cyclone two at 21:00  utc  this was the agency s first designation of a disturbance that had not yet developed into a tropical the storm continued to organize as it accelerated towards venezuela and trinidad and tobago throughout the night  with banding features becoming evident  later on june 19,  the system developed a closed low-level  circulation and was upgraded to tropical storm bret at 21:00  one day later  at 21:00  utc on june 20,  the last advisory on bret was issued following its degeneration into a tropical to phil klotzbach of colorado state university  bret was the earliest storm to form in the main development region on record  surpassing a record set by tropical storm ana in bret was also the lowest latitude named storm in the month of june since 1933  at in trinidad  one person died after he slipped and fell while running across a makeshift bridge  the fatality is considered indirectly related to another fatality occurred in tobago after a man s house collapsed on him  he eventually succumbed to his injuries a week nhc first began monitoring the potential for tropical cyclone formation over the northwestern caribbean sea on june a large area of disturbed weather developed within the region three days and it slowly organized while entering the central gulf of mexico  prompting the nhc to begin advisories on a potential tropical cyclone on june 19.  the structure of the system was initially sprawling  with tropical storm-force  winds well displaced from a broad area of low pressure with embedded a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system around 18:00  utc the following day was able to pinpoint a well-defined  center  indicating the formation of tropical storm despite the presence of dry air and strong wind shear  the cyclone still managed to attain peak winds of 60  mph (95  km h  before weakening on approach to the louisiana it made landfall between port arthur  texas and cameron  louisiana early on june 22  and weakened while progressing state of emergency was declared for biloxi  mississippi in anticipation of flooding  a ten-year-old  boy died from injuries sustained during the storm in fort morgan  a second fatality later occurred in bolivar peninsula  on june 29,  the nhc began tracking a tropical wave embedded within a large envelope of deep moisture across the coastline of western the disturbance was introduced as a potential contender for tropical cyclone formation two days later  as environmental conditions were expected to favor slow it began to show signs of organization over the central atlantic early on july but the chances for development began to decrease two days later as the system moved toward a more stable having already acquired a well-defined  circulation  the development of a persistent mass of deep convection around 03:00  utc the following day prompted the nhc to upgrade the wave to tropical depression four  located about 1,545  miles (2,485  km  east of the lesser despite wind shear being low  the nascent depression struggled to intensify due to a dry environment caused by a saharan air layer to its east  causing the low-level  circulation to weaken  and resulting in the tropical depression degenerating into an open tropical wave late on the next on july 15,  the nhc highlighted a low-pressure  trough over the central atlantic as having the potential to develop into a tropical cyclone in the coming the disturbance began to show signs of organization early on july and data from a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system confirmed the development of tropical storm don around 21:00  utc that the storm s overall appearance improved over subsequent hours up until around 09:00  utc  as a central dense overcast  accompanied by significant clusters of lightning  became don attained its peak intensity at this time  characterised by winds of approximately 50  mph (85  the next plane to investigate the cyclone a few hours later  however  found that the system s center had become less defined  and that sustained wind speeds had decreased to about 40  mph (65  a combination of reconnaissance data and surface observations from the windward islands indicated that don opened up into a tropical wave around 03:00  utc on july 19,  as it entered the eastern caribbean late july  a dissipating cold front extended into the northeastern gulf of mexico  where the nhc began forecasting the development of an area of low pressure over the next day on july 30.  any development was expected to be slow due to land proximity and marginal upper-level  contrary to predictions  a rapid period of organization occurred over the next 24  hours and the system was deemed as tropical depression six at 09:00  utc on july strengthening into tropical storm emily just two hours later  after attaining its peak intensity with winds of 45  mph (75  km h  and a minimum pressure of 1,005  mbar (29.7  emily made landfall on anna maria island around 14:45  utc  weakening quickly ensued  and later that day the circulation of emily became elongated as it was downgraded to a tropical the increasingly disrupted system later moved off the first coast of florida into the western atlantic early the next day  accelerating northeastwards before becoming embedded within a frontal zone early on august the classification of tropical storm emily  florida governor rick scott declared a state of emergency for 31  counties to ensure residents were provided with the necessary the storm spawned an ef0  tornado near bradenton  the tornado was on the ground for about 1.3  mi (2.1  km  and destroyed two barns and a few greenhouses  while an engineered wall collapsed  leaving about $96,000  in on august 1,  torrential rains related to emily impacted parts of miami beach  with accumulations reaching 6.97  in (177  mm  in 3.5  hours  of which 2.17  in (55  mm  fell in just 30  coinciding with high tide the deluge overwhelmed flood pumps  with three of them shutting down due to lightning-induced  power outages  and resulted in significant flash floods  multiple buildings suffered water damage  with some having 2.5  ft (0.76  m  of standing water  one person was hospitalized after becoming stuck in flood portions of downtown miami  such as brickell  were also heavily affected  numerous vehicles became stranded in flooded nhc began tracking a tropical wave in the southeastern caribbean sea for possible development on august after organizing for a few days  advisories were initiated on potential tropical cyclone seven at 21:00  utc on august the disturbance became tropical storm franklin at 03:00  utc on august after strengthening into a moderate tropical storm  franklin made its first landfall near pulticub  mexico at 03:00  utc on august the cyclone weakened considerably while over the peninsula  however its satellite presentation remained well-defined,  with the inner core tightening up later that day  franklin emerged into the bay of campeche  and immediately began strengthening again  becoming a hurricane late on august five hours after peaking in intensity with winds of 85  mph (140  km h  and a pressure of 981  mbar (28.97  franklin made landfall in lechuguillas  and thereafter began to rapidly weaken  by 15:00  utc on august 10,  franklin had dissipated as a tropical however  its mid-level  circulation remained intact and later contributed to the formation of tropical storm jova in the eastern pacific early on august upon classification of franklin as a potential tropical cyclone  tropical storm warnings were issued for much of the eastern side of the yucatán peninsula on august a small portion of the coastline was upgraded to a hurricane watch with the possibility of franklin nearing hurricane intensity as it approached the coastline the next night  approximately 330  people were reported as going into storm shelters  and around 2,200  relocated from the islands near the coastline to farther inland in advance of the in the mexican part of the peninsula  damage was reported as having being minimal  mainly in belize as the storm tracked slightly more northwards then expected  lessening nonetheless  some areas received up to a foot of august 2,  the nhc began monitoring a tropical wave and its associated convection over the western coast of as the disturbance tracked west-northwest,  its structure changed little in organization  but environmental conditions were expected to support the formation of a tropical instead  the system remained poorly defined and entered a less conducive environment east of the leeward after progressing into the southwestern atlantic several days later  the wave encountered more favorable upper-level  winds and began to show signs of following the formation of a well-defined  circulation  the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression at 03:00  utc on august by 21:00  utc that afternoon  it intensified into tropical storm at 03:00  utc on august 15,  gert intensified to a category 1  hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75  mph (120  km h   making it the second hurricane of the accelerating east-northeastwards,  gert peaked as a category 2  system early on august 17  at an unusually high latitude of thereafter  gert began to rapidly weaken as it shifted from the gulf stream over cooler just 12  hours after achieving peak intensity  gert weakened below hurricane status and evolved to an extratropical cyclone well east of nova people drowned due to strong rip currents produced by the hurricane  one in the outer banks of north carolina  and the other in nantucket  nhc began monitoring an area of low pressure southwest of cape verde on august 13,  which was expected to merge with a tropical wave that just emerged off the coast of africa  within a few instead the two systems remained with the first low pressure area coalescing into a potential tropical cyclone by 15:00  utc on august a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system was able to locate a well-defined  circulation  and the disturbance was upgraded to tropical storm harvey accordingly six hours on a westward course into the caribbean sea  the storm was plagued by relentless wind shear  and it degenerated to an open tropical wave south of hispaniola  by 03:00  utc on august harvey s remnants continued into the bay of campeche  where more conducive environmental conditions led to the re-designation  of a tropical depression  around 15:00  utc on august 23,  and subsequent intensification into a tropical storm by 04:00  utc on the next the tropical cyclone began a period of rapid intensification shortly thereafter  attaining hurricane intensity by 17:00  utc on august category 3  strength around 19:00  utc on august and category 4  intensity by 23:00  utc on that crossed the shore between port aransas and port o connor  texas around 03:00  utc on august 26,  possessing maximum winds of 130  mph (215  the storm gradually spun down  becoming a tropical storm around 18:00  utc on august 26,  as it meandered across southeastern a light steering pattern caused the storm to emerge into the gulf of mexico on august but a turn toward the north-northeast  brought it ashore west of cameron  louisiana  as a weak tropical storm around 09:00  utc on august the system weakened to a tropical depression over central louisiana late that day before losing tropical characteristics over central tennessee early on september fulton  and the surrounding cities bore the brunt of harvey s eyewall as it moved ashore in texas  numerous structures were heavily damaged or destroyed  boats were tossed or capsized  power poles were leant or snapped  and trees were downed  as debris covered roadways and cellphone service was compromised  communication to the hardest-hit  locales was severed  one person was killed in rockport after a fire began in his home  and approximately a dozen people were farther northeast  dire predictions of potentially catastrophic flooding came to fruition in houston and nearby locales  where floodwaters submerged interstates  forced residents to their attics and roofs  and overwhelmed emergency lines  the national weather service tweeted   this event is unprecedented   all impacts are unknown   beyond anything experienced     at least 30  people were killed in the houston area due to in addition to the flooding  harvey spawned several tornadoes around estimates place the damage caused by harvey at $198  harvey killed 90  people  including 1  in and 89  in the united the storm produced 64.58  in (1,640  mm  of rainfall in texas  the highest-ever  rainfall total for any tropical cyclone in the united states and the third-highest  rainfall total for a tropical cyclone in the atlantic 4]harvey  was the first major hurricane to strike the united states since hurricane wilma in 2005,  ending the record-length  4,323-day  span in which no tropical cyclones made landfall as major it is the most intense tropical cyclone to move ashore the us mainland since hurricane charley in 2004,  and the first category 4  hurricane to make landfall in texas since hurricane carla in westward-moving  tropical wave  first monitored over western africa on august organized into tropical storm irma around 15:00  utc on august amid an environment of low wind shear and warm ocean temperatures  the newly formed cyclone moved generally westward while intensifying  a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system east of the caribbean on september 5  found the cyclone at category 5  with a clear eye surrounded by a ring of extremely deep convection  irma attained its peak intensity with winds of 185  mph (295  km h  later that and maintained this intensity as it moved through the northern leeward some weakening occurred south of the but the cyclone regained category 5  intensity before making landfall on the sabana-camagüey  archipelago of cuba around 03:00  utc on september land interaction disrupted the storm but once again it strengthened to acquire winds of 130  mph (215  km h   before making landfall in cudjoe key of the florida keys early on september a few hours later  it struck marco island  florida  with winds of 115  mph (185  irma continued north and west  steadily weakening over the southeastern united states before losing tropical characteristics in georgia  early on september peak winds of 185  mph (295  km h   irma is the strongest atlantic storm outside of the gulf of mexico or caribbean sea on record  and is the 11th  most intense hurricane on record in the atlantic basin  maintaining peak intensity for 37  consecutive hours  irma is the only tropical cyclone on record worldwide to have had winds that intense for so long  as the storm moved through the northern leeward islands  it became the only category 5  to make a direct impact there  its landfall intensity ties it with the 1935  labor day hurricane as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the atlantic  two category 4  hurricanes  harvey and irma  struck the continental united states in the span of two weeks  this marks the first time the country has suffered two landfalls of such intensity during the same hurricane season  in recorded history  lastly  irma accrued the third-highest  accumulated cyclone energy index on the aftermath of irma  development on the islands of barbuda and saint martin was described as being "95%  destroyed  by respective political leaders  with 1,400  people feared homeless in so far  irma has resulted in at least 134  deaths  including 44  across the caribbean  and 90  in the united westward-moving  tropical wave exited the west coast of africa on august organizing into tropical storm jose over the open eastern atlantic by 15:00  utc on september the quickly-strengthening  cyclone attained hurricane intensity late on september reached major hurricane strength late on september and ultimately peaked as a high-end  category 4  hurricane with winds of 155  mph (250  km h  early on september moderate wind shear weakened the cyclone as it conducted a slow clockwise loop between bermuda and the caribbean sea and eventually moved north ahead of an approaching steering currents collapsed by early on september 21,  causing the system to stall offshore the northeastern united states as a weakening tropical with a rain shield in the northern and northwestern semicircles accompanied by a lack of deep convection over the center  the nhc declared jose a post-tropical  cyclone around 03:00  utc on september 22,  ending advisories once the storm s tropical storm-force  winds moved off the new england coast at 21:00  government of antigua and barbuda began efforts on september 8  to evacuate the entire island of barbuda prior to jose s anticipated arrival  as most structures on the island had been heavily damaged or destroyed by hurricane trough was present over the southwestern gulf of mexico on september 3,  producing a widespread area of two days later  a distinct low pressure area formed about 50  mi (80  km  east of tampico  at 21:00  utc that day  the nhc designated the system as tropical depression thirteen after an organized area of convection formed over the center  located in an area of weak steering currents  the depression drifted slowly eastward  with gradually decreasing wind shear and warm water temperatures  the system intensified into tropical storm katia on september 6,  as the convection became better later that day  an aircraft reconnaissance flight into the storm found a partial eye wall and surface winds of 76  mph (122  km h   on that basis  the nhc upgraded katia to hurricane the convection organized into a central dense overcast as the system late in the evening of september 8,  katia made landfall north of tecolutla  mexico as a weak category 1  the system rapidly dissipated over land on september 9.  katia s remnants traveled across central america and later emerged

increase in deep convection and an advanced scatterometer  ascat  pass which indicated that it was producing minimal tropical-storm-force  after encountering wind shear  lee gradually weakened into a tropical depression early on september 17  before degenerating into a remnant low two days the nhc monitored the remnants of lee intermittently for several days  but regeneration was not considered however  the mid-level  remnants of the cyclone became intertwined with an upper-level  trough  a deep burst of convection led to a new surface circulation  and by 21:00  utc on september 22,  the

presence of an eye on satellite imagery prompted the nhc to abruptly upgrade lee to a hurricane as it moved after attaining winds of 90  mph (150  km h   the storm weakened slightly due to moderate southeasterly wind by 09:00  utc on september 26,  however  the storm attained category 2  an eyewall replacement cycle that night led to the emergence of a larger eye surrounded by cold cloud tops  and by 15:00  utc on september 27,  lee attained its peak as a category 3  hurricane with winds of 115  mph (185  the system recurved northeast after peak intensity and quickly succumbed to strong

 thus reaching category 5  after striking dominica at that intensity a little over an hour the storm weakened slightly as it entered the eastern caribbean sea  amid favorable conditions  however  maria regained category 5  intensity and eventually reached peak winds of 175  mph (280  km h  late on september around 08:00  utc on september 20,  the eyewall of maria struck and a little over two hours later  the core of the storm made landfall near yabucoa  puerto rico  with winds of 155  mph (250  land interaction caused a significant degration in maria s structure  and it weakened to a

blow  with reports of flooding  downed trees  and damaged buildings  puerto rico also suffered catastrophic damage  the island s electric grid was devastated  leaving all 3.4  million residents without power  many structures were leveled  while floodwaters trapped thousands of citizens  the united states national guard  coast guard  army corps of engineers  and other like units worked to administer aid and assist in search and rescue operations  however  the u s  federal government response was criticized for its delay in waiving the jones act  a statute which prevented puerto rico

deaths and numerous water rescues  estimates of damage from maria range from $15.9  billion by estudios técnicos to $95  billion by moody s most of the damage occurred in puerto rico  ricardo rosselló  the governor of puerto rico  believes the storm caused $90  billion in the death toll currently stands at 97,  with 28  killed in dominica  5  in the dominican republic  2  in guadeloupe  3  in haiti

circulation on the same while the low drifted slowly to the northeast  it began to lose its frontal system and acquire subtropical characteristics by october the next day  the storm encountered stronger wind shear  removing some of its convection  and slightly weakening the system  however  the storm eventually grew better organized and developed more convection around its low pressure center later in the early on october 9,  the system fully transitioned into a tropical cyclone  prompting the nhc to begin issuing advisories on tropical depression the tropical depression continued to strengthen  becoming tropical storm ophelia later that ophelia continued to strengthen due to low wind shear and on october 11,  the national hurricane center upgraded it to a hurricane  making it

ophelia and storm hurricane ophelia also fanned wildfires in portugal and spain  killing 49  october 22,  the nhc forecasted that a broad area of low pressure would form in the southwestern caribbean on october 23,  as predicted  a broad low formed off of the northwestern coast of however  the system remained disorganized for the next several until the afternoon of october 27,  when it quickly organized  prompting the nhc to upgrade the system into potential tropical cyclone eighteen  slow development occurred over the next day  but the storm was ultimately deemed a tropical depression at

six hours later  shortly thereafter  philippe became poorly organized as it interacted with a non-tropical  area of low pressure and a cold front  with the circulation becoming elongated  with three vortices existing within a broader low-level  circulation  philippe then made landfall over the everglades in southwest florida with winds of 45  mph at around 9:00  utc on october 29.  effects were relatively minor in florida although philippe did spawn a few weak including one in west palm beach  and another in after crossing the southern florida peninsula  philippe began to intensify over the open atlantic reaching a peak strength of 60  mph  however  by 21:00  utc  philippe dissipated  as the circulation merged with a cold front that was part of a larger extratropical cyclone  which was bringing heavy rain and wind to the northeastern united states and eastern canada  philippe did not become a hurricane  thus ending a record-tying  period with 10  consecutive hurricanes  with winds
