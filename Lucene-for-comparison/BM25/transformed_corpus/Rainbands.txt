 rainband -  wikipediaa rainband is a cloud and precipitation structure associated with an area of rainfall which is significantly elongated  rainbands can be stratiform or and are generated by differences in temperature  when noted on weather radar imagery  this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation  tropical cyclone rainbands contain showers and thunderstorms that  together with the eyewall and the eye  constitute a hurricane or tropical storm  the extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone s intensity rainbands spawned near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which are able to produce tornadoes  rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front s orientation due to the formation of a low-level  barrier jet  bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries  if enough moisture is present  if sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front  they can mask the location of the cold front itself  banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain or snow  behind extratropical cyclones  rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the great lakes  if the atmosphere is cold enough  these rainbands can yield heavy snow rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward and tend to be wide and stratiform in in an atmosphere with rich low level moisture and vertical wind narrow  convective rainbands known as squall lines generally in the cyclone s warm sector  ahead of strong cold fronts associated with extratropical wider rain bands can occur behind cold fronts  which tend to have more stratiform  and less convective  within the cold sector north to northwest of a cyclone center  in colder cyclones  small scale  or mesoscale  bands of heavy snow can occur within a cyclone s comma head precipitation pattern with a width of 32  kilometres (20  mi  to 80  kilometres (50  these bands in the comma head are associated with areas of frontogensis  or zones of strengthening temperature southwest of extratropical cyclones  curved flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm great lakes can lead to narrow lake effect snow bands which bring significant localized exist in the periphery of tropical cyclones  which point towards the cyclone s center of low rainbands within tropical cyclones require ample moisture and a low level pool of cooler bands located 80  kilometres (50  mi  to 150  kilometres (93  mi  from a cyclone s center migrate they are capable of producing heavy rains and squalls of wind  as well as particularly in the storm s right-front  rainbands move closer to the center  forming a secondary  or outer  eyewall within intense spiral rainbands are such a basic structure to a tropical cyclone that in most tropical cyclone basins  use of the satellite-based  dvorak technique is the primary method used to determine a tropical cyclone s maximum sustained within this method  the extent of spiral banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is used to assign a maximum sustained wind and a central central pressure values for their centers of low pressure derived from this technique are approximate different programs have been studying these rainbands  including rainex convective rainbands can form parallel to terrain on its windward side  due to lee waves triggered by hills just upstream of the cloud s their spacing is normally 5  kilometres (3.1  mi  to 10  kilometres (6.2  mi  when bands of precipitation near frontal zones approach steep topography  a low-level  barrier jet stream forms parallel to and just prior to the mountain ridge  which slows down the frontal rainband just prior to the mountain if enough moisture is present  sea breeze and land breeze fronts can form convective rainbands  sea breeze front thunderstorm lines can become strong enough to mask the location of an approaching cold front by the edge of ocean currents can lead to the development of thunderstorm bands due to heat differential at this downwind of islands  bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges  offshore california  this has been noted in the wake of cold
