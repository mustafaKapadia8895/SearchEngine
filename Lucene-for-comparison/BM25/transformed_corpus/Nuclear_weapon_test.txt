 nuclear weapons testing -  wikipedianuclear weapons tests are experiments carried out to determine the effectiveness  yield  and explosive capability of nuclear weapons  throughout the twentieth century  most nations that developed nuclear weapons tested them  testing nuclear weapons can yield information about how the weapons work  as well as how the weapons behave under various conditions and how personnel  structures  and equipment behave when subjected to nuclear explosions  nuclear testing has often been used as an indicator of scientific and military strength  and many tests have been overtly political in their intention  most nuclear weapons states publicly declared their nuclear status by means of a nuclear test the first nuclear device was detonated as a test by the united states at the trinity site on july 16,  1945,  with a yield approximately equivalent to 20  kilotons of tnt  the first thermonuclear weapon technology test of engineer device  codenamed  ivy mike   was tested at the enewetak atoll in the marshall islands on november 1,  1952   local date   also by the united states  the largest nuclear weapon ever tested was the  tsar bomba  of the soviet union at novaya zemlya on october 30,  1961,  with the largest yield ever seen  an estimated 50–58  megatons in 1963,  three  uk  us  soviet union  of the four nuclear states and many non-nuclear  states signed the limited test ban treaty  pledging to refrain from testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere  underwater  or in outer space  the treaty permitted underground nuclear testing  france continued atmospheric testing until 1974,  and china continued until 1980.  neither has signed the tests in the united states continued until 1992   its last nuclear test   the soviet union until 1990,  the united kingdom until 1991,  and both china and france until 1996.  in signing the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban  treaty in 1996,  these states have pledged to discontinue all nuclear testing  the treaty has not yet entered into force because of failure to be ratified by eight countries  non-signatories  india and pakistan last tested nuclear weapons in 1998.  north korea conducted nuclear tests in 2006,  2009,  2013,  2016,  and 2017.  the most recent confirmed nuclear test in september 2017  in north korea nuclear weapons tests have historically been divided into four categories reflecting the medium or location of the test another way to classify nuclear tests are by the number of explosions that constitute the test  the treaty definition of a salvo test is  in conformity with treaties between the united states and the soviet union  a salvo is defined  for multiple explosions for peaceful purposes  as two or more separate explosions where a period of time between successive individual explosions does not exceed 5  seconds and where the burial points of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines  each of them connecting two burial points  and the total length does not exceed 40  kilometers  for nuclear weapon tests  a salvo is defined as two or more underground nuclear explosions conducted at a test site within an area delineated by a circle having a diameter of two kilometers and conducted within a total period of time of 0.1  ussr has exploded up to eight devices in a single salvo test  pakistan s second and last official test exploded four different devices  almost all lists in the literature are lists of tests  in the lists in wikipedia  for example  operation cresset has separate items for cremino and caerphilly  which together constitute a single test   the lists are of explosions separately from these designations  nuclear tests are also often categorized by the purpose of the test itself aside from these technical considerations  tests have been conducted for political and training purposes  and can often serve multiple purposes hydronuclear tests study nuclear materials under the conditions of explosive shock compression  they can create sub-critical  conditions  or supercritical conditions with yields ranging from negligible all the way up to a substantial fraction of full weapon mass experiments determine the quantity of fissile material required for criticality with a variety of fissile material compositions  densities  shapes  and reflectors  they can be sub-critical  or super-critical,  in which case significant radiation fluxes can be produced  this type of test resulted in several criticality accidents.sub-critical   or cold  tests are any type of tests involving nuclear materials and possibly high-explosives   like those mentioned above  that purposely result in no yield  the name refers to the lack of creation of a critical mass of fissile material  they are the only type of tests allowed under the interpretation of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban  treaty tacitly agreed to by the major atomic sub-critical  tests continue to be performed by the united states  russia  and the people s republic of china  at test executed by the united states have also been simulations of the effects of nuclear detonations using conventional explosives  such as the minor scale u s  test in 1985).  the explosives might be spiked with radioactive materials to simulate fallout dispersal the first atomic weapons test was conducted near alamogordo  new mexico  on july 16,  1945,  during the manhattan project  and given the codename  trinity   the test was originally to confirm that the implosion-type  nuclear weapon design was feasible  and to give an idea of what the actual size and effects of a nuclear explosion would be before they were used in combat against japan  while the test gave a good approximation of many of the explosion s effects  it did not give an appreciable understanding of nuclear fallout  which was not well understood by the project scientists until well after the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki the united states conducted six atomic tests before the soviet union developed their first atomic bomb (rds-1)  and tested it on august 29,  1949.  neither country had very many atomic weapons to spare at first  and so testing was relatively infrequent  when the u s  used two weapons for operation crossroads in 1946,  they were detonating over 20%  of their current arsenal   however  by the 1950s  the united states had established a dedicated test site on its own territory  nevada test site  and was also using a site in the marshall islands  pacific proving grounds  for extensive atomic and nuclear testing the early tests were used primarily to discern the military effects of atomic weapons  crossroads had involved the effect of atomic weapons on a navy  and how they functioned underwater  and to test new weapon designs  during the 1950s,  these included new hydrogen bomb designs  which were tested in the pacific  and also new and improved fission weapon designs  the soviet union also began testing on a limited scale  primarily in kazakhstan  during the later phases of the cold war  though  both countries developed accelerated testing programs  testing many hundreds of bombs over the last half of the 20th  century atomic and nuclear tests can involve many hazards  some of these were illustrated in the u s  castle bravo test in 1954.  the weapon design tested was a new form of hydrogen bomb  and the scientists underestimated how vigorously some of the weapon materials would react  as a result  the explosion—with a yield of 15  mt—was over twice what was predicted  aside from this problem  the weapon also generated a large amount of radioactive nuclear fallout  more than had been anticipated  and a change in the weather pattern caused the fallout to spread in a direction not cleared in advance  the fallout plume spread high levels of radiation for over a hundred miles  contaminating a number of populated islands in nearby atoll formations  though they were soon evacuated  many of the islands  inhabitants suffered from radiation burns and later from other effects such as increased cancer rate and birth defects  as did the crew of the japanese fishing boat daigo fukuryū maru  one crewman died from radiation sickness after returning to port  and it was feared that the radioactive fish they had been carrying had made it into the japanese food supply castle bravo was the worst u s  nuclear accident  but many of its component problems—unpredictably large yields  changing weather patterns  unexpected fallout contamination of populations and the food supply—occurred during other atmospheric nuclear weapons tests by other countries as well  concerns over worldwide fallout rates eventually led to the partial test ban treaty in 1963,  which limited signatories to underground testing  not all countries stopped atmospheric testing  but because the united states and the soviet union were responsible for roughly 86%  of all nuclear tests  their compliance cut the overall level substantially  france continued atmospheric testing until 1974,  and china until 1980.a  tacit moratorium on testing was in effect from 1958  to 1961,  and ended with a series of soviet tests in late 1961,  including the tsar bomba  the largest nuclear weapon ever tested  the united states responded in 1962  with operation dominic  involving dozens of tests  including the explosion of a missile launched from a submarine almost all new nuclear powers have announced their possession of nuclear weapons with a nuclear test  the only acknowledged nuclear power that claims never to have conducted a test was south africa  although see vela incident   which has since dismantled all of its weapons  israel is widely thought to possess a sizable nuclear arsenal  though it has never tested  unless they were involved in vela  experts disagree on whether states can have reliable nuclear arsenals—especially ones using advanced warhead designs  such as hydrogen bombs and miniaturized weapons—without testing  though all agree that it is very unlikely to develop significant nuclear innovations without testing  one other approach is to use supercomputers to conduct  virtual  testing  but codes need to be validated against test data there have been many attempts to limit the number and size of nuclear tests  the most far-reaching  is the comprehensive test ban treaty of 1996,  which has not  as of been ratified by eight of the  annex 2  countries  required for it to take effect  including the united states  nuclear testing has since become a controversial issue in the united states  with a number of politicians saying that future testing might be necessary to maintain the aging warheads from the cold war  because nuclear testing is seen as furthering nuclear arms development  many are opposed to future testing as an acceleration of the arms race in total nuclear test megatonnage  from 1945–92,  520  atmospheric nuclear explosions  including 8  underwater  have been conducted with a total yield of 545  with a peak occurring in 1961-62,  when 340  megatons were detonated in the atmosphere by the united states and soviet while the estimated number of underground nuclear tests conducted in the period from 1957  to 1992  is 1,352  explosions with a total yield of 90  first atomic test   trinity   took place on july 16,  1945.the  sedan test of 1962  was an experiment by the united states in using nuclear weapons to excavate large amounts of earth the nuclear powers have conducted more than 2,000  nuclear test explosions  numbers are approximate  as some test results have been disputed   there may also have been at least three alleged but unacknowledged nuclear explosions  see list of alleged nuclear tests  including the vela incident from the first nuclear test in 1945  until tests by pakistan in 1998,  there was never a period of more than 22  months with no nuclear testing  june 1998  to october 2006  was the longest period since 1945  with no acknowledged nuclear tests a summary table of all the nuclear testing that has happened since 1945  is here  worldwide nuclear testing counts and summary there are many proposed anti-nuclear  explosion treaties  such as the partial nuclear test ban treaty  and the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty  most of these treaties were passed because scientists in many different countries noticed spikes in radiation levels in civilian needed   nuclear testing involving humans also contributed to the formation of the treaties  and examples can be seen in the following articles the partial nuclear test ban treaty makes it illegal to detonate any nuclear explosion anywhere except underground  in order to reduce atmospheric fallout  most countries have signed and ratified the partial nuclear test ban  which went into effect in october 1963.  of the nuclear states  france  china  and north korea have never signed the partial nuclear test ban 1996  comprehensive nuclear-test-ban  treaty  ctbt  bans all nuclear explosions everywhere  including underground  for that purpose  the preparatory commission of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban  treaty organization is building an international monitoring system with 337  facilities located all over the globe  85%  of these facilities are already as of may the ctbt has been signed by 183  states  of which 157  have also ratified  however  for the treaty to enter into force it needs to be ratified by 44  specific nuclear technology-holder  countries  these  annex 2  states  participated in the negotiations on the ctbt between 1994  and 1996  and possessed nuclear power or research reactors at that time  the ratification of eight annex 2  states is still missing  china  egypt  iran  israel and the united states have signed but not ratified the treaty  india  north korea and pakistan have not signed following is a list of the treaties applicable to nuclear testing over 500  atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were conducted at various sites around the world from 1945  to 1980.  as public awareness and concern mounted over the possible health hazards associated with exposure to the nuclear fallout  various studies were done to assess the extent of the hazard  a centers for disease control and prevention  national cancer institute study claims that nuclear fallout might have led to approximately 11,000  excess deaths  most caused by thyroid cancer linked to exposure to following list is of milestone nuclear explosions  in addition to the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki  the first nuclear test of a given weapon type for a country is included  and tests which were otherwise notable  such as the largest test ever   all yields  explosive power  are given in their estimated energy equivalents in kilotons of tnt  see tnt equivalent   putative tests  like vela incident  have not been included  staging  refers to whether it was a  true  hydrogen bomb of the so-called  teller-ulam  configuration or simply a form of a boosted fission weapon  for a more complete list of nuclear test series  see list of nuclear tests  some exact yield estimates  such as that of the tsar bomba and the tests by india and pakistan in 1998,  are somewhat contested among specialists
