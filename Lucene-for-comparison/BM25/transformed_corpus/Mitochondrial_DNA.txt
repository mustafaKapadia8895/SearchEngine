 mitochondrial dna -  wikipediamitochondrial dna  mtdna or is the dna located in mitochondria  cellular organelles within eukaryotic cells that convert chemical energy from food into a form that cells can use  adenosine triphosphate  atp   mitochondrial dna is only a small portion of the dna in a eukaryotic cell  most of the dna can be found in the cell nucleus and  in plants and algae  also in plastids such as chloroplasts in humans  the 16,569  base pairs of mitochondrial dna encode for only 37  human mitochondrial dna was the first significant part of the human genome to be sequenced  in most species  including humans  mtdna is inherited solely from the animal mtdna evolves faster than nuclear genetic it represents a mainstay of phylogenetics and evolutionary biology  it also permits an examination of the relatedness of populations  and so has become important in anthropology and biogeography nuclear and mitochondrial dna are thought to be of separate evolutionary origin  with the mtdna being derived from the circular genomes of the bacteria that were engulfed by the early ancestors of today s eukaryotic cells  this theory is called the endosymbiotic theory  each mitochondrion is estimated to contain 2–10  mtdna in the cells of extant organisms  the vast majority of the proteins present in the mitochondria  numbering approximately 1500  different types in mammals  are coded for by nuclear dna  but the genes for some  if not most  of them are thought to have originally been of bacterial origin  having since been transferred to the eukaryotic nucleus during reasons why mitochondria have retained some genes are debated  the existence in some species of mitochondrion-derived  organelles lacking a suggests that complete gene loss is possible  and transferring mitochondrial genes to the nucleus has several the difficulty of targeting remotely-produced  hydrophobic protein products to the mitochondrion is one hypothesis for why some genes are retained in colocalisation for redox regulation is another  citing the desirability of localised control over mitochondrial recent analysis of a wide range of mtdna genomes suggests that both these features may dictate mitochondrial gene most multicellular organisms  mtdna is inherited from the mother  maternally inherited   mechanisms for this include simple dilution  an egg contains on average 200,000  mtdna molecules  whereas a healthy human sperm was reported to contain on average 5     degradation of sperm mtdna in the male genital tract  in the fertilized egg  and  at least in a few organisms  failure of sperm mtdna to enter the egg  whatever the mechanism  this single parent  uniparental inheritance  pattern of mtdna inheritance is found in most animals  most plants and in fungi as well in sexual reproduction  mitochondria are normally inherited exclusively from the mother  the mitochondria in mammalian sperm are usually destroyed by the egg cell after fertilization  also  most mitochondria are present at the base of the sperm s tail  which is used for propelling the sperm cells  sometimes the tail is lost during fertilization  in 1999  it was reported that paternal sperm mitochondria  containing mtdna  are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the some in vitro fertilization techniques  particularly injecting a sperm into an oocyte  may interfere with this the fact that mitochondrial dna is maternally inherited enables genealogical researchers to trace maternal lineage far back in time  (y-chromosomal  dna  paternally inherited  is used in an analogous way to determine the patrilineal history   this is usually accomplished on human mitochondrial dna by sequencing the hypervariable control regions (hvr1  or hvr2),  and sometimes the complete molecule of the mitochondrial dna  as a genealogical dna hvr1,  for example  consists of about 440  base pairs  these 440  base pairs are then compared to the control regions of other individuals  either specific people or subjects in a database  to determine maternal lineage  most often  the comparison is made to the revised cambridge reference sequence  vilà et al  have published studies tracing the matrilineal descent of domestic dogs to the concept of the mitochondrial eve is based on the same type of analysis  attempting to discover the origin of humanity by tracking the lineage back in time mtdna is highly conserved  and its relatively slow mutation rates  compared to other dna regions such as microsatellites  make it useful for studying the evolutionary relationships—phylogeny—of organisms  biologists can determine and then compare mtdna sequences among different species and use the comparisons to build an evolutionary tree for the species examined  however  due to the slow mutation rates it experiences  it is often hard to distinguish between closely related species to any large degree  so other methods of analysis must be used entities undergoing uniparental inheritance and with little to no recombination may be expected to be subject to muller s ratchet  the accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost  animal populations of mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process known as the mtdna bottleneck  the bottleneck exploits stochastic processes in the cell to increase in the cell-to-cell  variability in mutant load as an organism develops  a single egg cell with some proportion of mutant mtdna thus produces an embryo where different cells have different mutant loads  cell-level  selection may then act to remove those cells with more mutant mtdna  leading to a stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations  the mechanism underlying the bottleneck is with a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence for a combination of random partitioning of mtdnas at cell divisions and random turnover of mtdna molecules within the uniparental inheritance of mtdna is observed in bivalve mollusks  in those species  females have only one type of mtdna  f   whereas males have f type mtdna in their somatic cells  but m type of mtdna  which can be as much as 30%  divergent  in germline paternally inherited mitochondria have additionally been reported in some insects such as fruit and periodical mitochondrial inheritance was recently discovered in plymouth rock evidence supports rare instances of male mitochondrial inheritance in some mammals as well  specifically  documented occurrences exist for where the male-inherited  mitochondria were subsequently rejected  it has also been found in and in cloned it has been found in a single case in a human many of these cases involve cloned embryos or subsequent rejection of the paternal mitochondria  others document in vivo inheritance and persistence under lab conditions an ivf technique known as mitochondrial donation or mitochondrial replacement therapy  mrt  results in offspring containing mtdna from a donor female  and nuclear dna from the mother and father  in the spindle transfer procedure  the nucleus of an egg is inserted into the cytoplasm of an egg from a donor female which has had its nucleus removed  but still contains the donor female s mtdna  the composite egg is then fertilized with the male s sperm  the procedure is used when a woman with genetically defective mitochondria wishes to procreate and produce offspring with healthy the first known child to be born as a result of mitochondrial donation was a boy born to a jordanian couple in mexico on 6  april most multicellular organisms  the mtdna – or mitogenome – is organized as a circular  covalently closed  double-stranded  dna  but in many unicellular  e g  the ciliate tetrahymena or the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii  and in rare cases also in multicellular organisms  e g  in some species of cnidaria   the mtdna is found as linearly organized dna  most of these linear mtdnas possess telomerase independent telomeres  i e  the ends of the linear dna  with different modes of replication  which have made them interesting objects of research  as many of these unicellular organisms with linear mtdna are known human mitochondrial dna  and probably for that of metazoans in general   100–10,000  separate copies of mtdna are usually present per somatic cell  egg and sperm cells are exceptions   in mammals  each double-stranded  circular mtdna molecule consists of base pairs  the two strands of mtdna are differentiated by their nucleotide content  with a guanine-rich  strand referred to as the heavy strand  or h-strand)  and a cytosine-rich  strand referred to as the light strand  or l-strand).  the heavy strand encodes 28  genes  and the light strand encodes 9  genes for a total of 37  of the 37  genes  13  are for proteins  polypeptides   22  are for transfer rna  trna  and two are for the small and large subunits of ribosomal rna the human mitogenome contains overlapping genes (atp8  and atp6  as well as nd4l  and nd4:  see the human mitochondrial genome map   a feature that is rare in animal needed  the 37-gene  pattern is also seen among most metazoans  although in some cases one or more of these genes is absent and the mtdna size range is greater great variation in mtdna gene content and size exists among fungi and plants  although there appears to be a core subset of genes that are present in all eukaryotes  except for the few that have no mitochondria at some plant species have enormous mitochondrial genomes  with silene conica mtdna containing as many as 11,300,000  base surprisingly  even those huge mtdnas contain the same number and kinds of genes as related plants with much smaller the genome of the mitochondrion of the cucumber  cucumis sativus  consists of three circular chromosomes  lengths 1556,  84  and 45  kilobases   which are entirely or largely autonomous with regard to their smallest mitochondrial genome sequenced to date is the 5967  bp mtdna of the parasite plasmodium are six main genome types found in mitochondrial genomes  these genome types were classified by “kolesnikov   gerasimov (2012)"  and differ in various ways such as a circular versus linear genome  genome size  the presence of introns or plasmid like structures  and whether the genetic material is a singular molecule or collection of homogeneous or heterogeneous is only one mitochondrial genome type found in animal cells  this genome contains one circular molecule with between 11–28kbp  of genetic material  type are three different genome types found in plants and fungi  the first type is a circular genome that has introns  type 2)  and may range from 19–1000kbp  in length  the second genome type is a circular genome  about 20–1000kbp)  that also has a plasmid-like  structure (1kb)   type 3).  the final genome type that can be found in plant and fungi is a linear genome made up of homogeneous dna molecules  type 5).protists  contain the most diverse mitochondrial genomes  with five different types found in this kingdom  type 2,  type 3  and type 5  mentioned in the plant and fungal genomes also exists in some protist  as well as two unique genome types  the first of these is a heterogeneous collection of circular dna molecules  type 4)  and the final genome type found in protists is a heterogeneous collection of linear molecules  type 6).  genome types 4  and 6  both range from 1–200kbp  in size endosymbiotic gene transfer  the process of genes that were coded in the mitochondrial genome being transferred to the cell s main genome likely explains why more complex organisms  such as humans  have smaller mitochondrial genomes than simpler organisms  such as protists mitochondrial dna is replicated by the dna polymerase gamma complex which is composed of a 140  kda catalytic dna polymerase encoded by the polg gene and two 55  kda accessory subunits encoded by the polg2  the replisome machinery is formed by dna polymerase  twinkle and mitochondrial ssb proteins  twinkle is a helicase  which unwinds short stretches of dsdna in the 5′  to 3′  embryogenesis  replication of mtdna is strictly down-regulated  from the fertilized oocyte through the preimplantation the resulting reduction in per-cell  copy number of mtdna plays a role in the mitochondrial bottleneck  exploiting cell-to-cell  variability to ameliorate the inheritance of damaging at the blastocyst stage  the onset of mtdna replication is specific to the cells of the in contrast  the cells of the inner cell mass restrict mtdna replication until they receive the signals to differentiate to specific cell animal mitochondria  each dna strand is transcribed continuously and produces a polycistronic rna molecule  between most  but not all  protein-coding  regions  trnas are present  see the human mitochondrial genome map   during transcription  the trnas acquire their characteristic l-shape  that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes  with the mitochondrial rna processing  individual mrna  rrna  and trna sequences are released from the primary folded trnas therefore act as secondary structure concept that mtdna is particularly susceptible to reactive oxygen species generated by the respiratory chain due to its proximity remains mtdna does not accumulate any more oxidative base damage than nuclear it has been reported that at least some types of oxidative dna damage are repaired more efficiently in mitochondria than they are in the mtdna is packaged with proteins which appear to be as protective as proteins of the nuclear moreover  mitochondria evolved a unique mechanism which maintains mtdna integrity through degradation of excessively damaged genomes followed by replication of intact repaired mtdna  this mechanism is not present in the nucleus and is enabled by multiple copies of mtdna present in mitochondria the outcome of mutation in mtdna may be an alteration in the coding instructions for some which may have an effect on organism metabolism and or fitness mutations of mitochondrial dna can lead to a number of illnesses including exercise intolerance and kearns–sayre syndrome  kss   which causes a person to lose full function of heart  eye  and muscle movements  some evidence suggests that they might be major contributors to the aging process and age-associated  particularly in the context of disease  the proportion of mutant mtdna molecules in a cell is termed heteroplasmy  the within-cell  and between-cell  distributions of heteroplasmy dictate the onset and severity of disease and are influenced by complicated stochastic processes within the cell and during in mitochondrial trnas can be responsible for severe diseases like the melas and merrf in nuclear genes that encode proteins that mitochondria use can also contribute to mitochondrial diseases  these diseases do not follow mitochondrial inheritance patterns  but instead follow mendelian inheritance a mutation in mtdna has been used to help diagnose prostate cancer in patients with negative prostate the idea is controversial  some evidence suggests a link between aging and mitochondrial genome in essence  mutations in mtdna upset a careful balance of reactive oxygen species  ros  production and enzymatic ros scavenging  by enzymes like superoxide dismutase  catalase  glutathione peroxidase and others   however  some mutations that increase ros production  e g   by reducing antioxidant defenses  in worms increase  rather than decrease  their also  naked mole rats  rodents about the size of mice  live about eight times longer than mice despite having reduced  compared to mice  antioxidant defenses and increased oxidative damage to once  there was thought to be a positive feedback loop at work  a  vicious cycle    as mitochondrial dna accumulates genetic damage caused by free radicals  the mitochondria lose function and leak free radicals into the cytosol  a decrease in mitochondrial function reduces overall metabolic however  this concept was conclusively disproved when it was demonstrated that mice  which were genetically altered to accumulate mtdna mutations at accelerated rate do age prematurely  but their tissues do not produce more ros as predicted by the  vicious cycle  supporting a link between longevity and mitochondrial dna  some studies have found correlations between biochemical properties of the mitochondrial dna and the longevity of extensive research is being conducted to further investigate this link and methods to combat aging  presently  gene therapy and nutraceutical supplementation are popular areas of ongoing bjelakovic et al  analyzed the results of 78  studies between 1977  and 2012,  involving a total of 296,707  participants  and concluded that antioxidant supplements do not reduce all-cause  mortality nor extend lifespan  while some of them  such as beta carotene  vitamin e  and higher doses of vitamin a  may actually increase the past decade  an israeli research group led by professor vadim fraifeld has shown that extraordinarily strong and significant correlations exist between the mtdna base composition and animal species-specific  maximum life as demonstrated in their work  higher mtdna guanine   cytosine content  gc   strongly associates with longer maximum life spans across animal species  an additional astonishing observation is that the mtdna gc  correlation with the maximum life spans is independent of the well-known  correlation between animal species metabolic rate and maximum life spans  the mtdna gc  and resting metabolic rate explain the differences in animal species maximum life spans in a multiplicative manner  i e   species maximum life span   their mtdna gc    metabolic to support the scientific community in carrying out comparative analyses between mtdna features and longevity across animals  a dedicated database was built named breakpoints frequently occur within or near regions showing non-canonical  (non-b)  conformations  namely hairpins  cruciforms and cloverleaf-like  moreover  there is data supporting the involvement of helix-distorting  intrinsically curved regions and long g-tetrads  in eliciting instability events  in addition  higher breakpoint densities were consistently observed within gc-skewed  regions and in the close vicinity of the degenerate sequence motif nuclear dna  which is inherited from both parents and in which genes are rearranged in the process of recombination  there is usually no change in mtdna from parent to offspring  although mtdna also recombines  it does so with copies of itself within the same mitochondrion  because of this and because the mutation rate of animal mtdna is higher than that of nuclear mtdna is a powerful tool for tracking ancestry through females  matrilineage  and has been used in this role to track the ancestry of many species back hundreds of generations the rapid mutation rate  in animals  makes mtdna useful for assessing genetic relationships of individuals or groups within a species and also for identifying and quantifying the phylogeny  evolutionary relationships  see phylogenetics  among different species  to do this  biologists determine and then compare the mtdna sequences from different individuals or species  data from the comparisons is used to construct a network of relationships among the sequences  which provides an estimate of the relationships among the individuals or species from which the mtdnas were taken  mtdna can be used to estimate the relationship between both closely related and distantly related species  due to the high mutation rate of mtdna in animals  the 3rd  positions of the codons change relatively rapidly  and thus provide information about the genetic distances among closely related individuals or species  on the other hand  the substitution rate of mt-proteins  is very low  thus amino acid changes accumulate slowly  with corresponding slow changes at 1st  and 2nd  codon positions  and thus they provide information about the genetic distances of distantly related species  statistical models that treat substitution rates among codon positions separately  can thus be used to simultaneously estimate phylogenies that contain both closely and distantly related dna was admitted into evidence for the first time ever in 1996  during state of tennessee v  paul the 1998  court case of commonwealth of pennsylvania v  patricia lynne mitochondrial dna was admitted into evidence in the state of pennsylvania for the first the case was featured in episode 55  of season 5  of the true crime drama series forensic files  season needed mitochondrial dna was first admitted into evidence in california in the successful prosecution of david westerfield for the 2002  kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old  danielle van dam in san diego  it was used for both human and dog this was the first trial in the u s  to admit canine remains of king richard iii were identified by comparing his mtdna with that of two matrilineal descendants of his dna was discovered in the 1960s  by margit m  k  nass and sylvan nass by electron microscopy as dnase-sensitive  threads inside and by ellen haslbrunner  hans tuppy and gottfried schatz by biochemical assays on highly purified mitochondrial specialized databases have been founded to collect mitochondrial genome sequences and other information  although most of them focus on sequence data  some of them include phylogenetic or functional information several specialized databases exist that report polymorphisms and mutations in the human mitochondrial dna  together with the assessment of their pathogenicity
