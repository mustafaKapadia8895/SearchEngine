leading sulphur-producing  area throughout the 19th  century  but have declined since the 1950s.sicily  and its surrounding small islands have some highly active volcanoes  mount etna is the largest active volcano in europe and still casts black ash over the island with its ever-present  eruptions  it currently stands 3,329  metres (10,922  ft  high  though this varies with summit eruptions  the mountain is 21  m (69  ft  lower now than it was in 1981.  it is the highest mountain in italy south of the alps  etna covers an area of 1,190  km2  (459  sq mi  with a basal circumference of 140  km (87  mi   this makes it by far the largest of the three active volcanoes in italy  being about two and a half times the height of the next largest  mount vesuvius  in greek mythology  the deadly monster typhon was trapped under the mountain by zeus  the god of the sky  mount etna is widely regarded as a cultural symbol and icon of sicily mount etna rising over suburbs of cataniathe aeolian islands in the tyrrhenian sea  to the northeast of mainland sicily form a volcanic complex  and include stromboli  the three volcanoes of vulcano  vulcanello and lipari are also currently active  although the latter is usually dormant  off the southern coast of sicily  the underwater volcano of ferdinandea  which is part of the larger empedocles volcano  last erupted in 1831.  it is located between the coast of agrigento and the island of pantelleria  which itself is a dormant volcano  the autonomous region also includes several neighbouring islands  the aegadian islands  the aeolian islands  pantelleria and lampedusa the island is drained by several rivers  most of which flow through the central area and enter the sea at the south of the island  the salso flows through parts of enna and caltanissetta before entering the mediterranean sea at the port of licata  to the east  the alcantara flows through the province of messina and enters the sea at giardini naxos  and the

south-western,  the climate is affected by the african currents and summers can be scorching sicily is seen as an island of warm winters but also  above all along the tyrrhenian coast and in the inland areas  winters can be cold  with typical continental climate snow falls in abundance above 900–1000  metres  but stronger cold waves can easily carry it in the hills and even in coastal cities  especially in the northern coast of island  the interior mountains  especially nebrodi  madonie and etna  enjoy a fully mountain climate  with heavy snowfalls during winter  the summit of mount etna is usually snow capped from october to may on the other hand  especially in the summer it is not unusual that there is the sirocco  the wind from the sahara  rainfall is scarce  and water proves deficient in some provinces where water crisis can happen sometimes according to the regional agency for waste and water  on 10  august 1999,  the weather station of catenanuova  en  recorded a maximum temperature of 48.5  °c (119  the official european record – measured by minimum maximum thermometers – is held by athens  greece  which reported a maximum of 48.0  °c (118  °f  in total precipitation is highly variable  generally increasing with elevation  in general  the southern and southeast coast receives the least rainfall  less than 50  cm (20  in    and the northern and northeastern highlands the most  over 100  cm (39  in   sicily is an often-quoted  example of man-made  deforestation  which has occurred since roman times  when the island was turned into an agricultural this gradually dried the climate  leading to a decline in rainfall and the drying of rivers  the central and southwest provinces are practically devoid of any in northern sicily  there are three important forests  near mount etna  in the nebrodi mountains and in the bosco della ficuzza s natural reserve near palermo  the nebrodi mountains regional park  established on 4  august 1993  and covering 86,000  hectares (210,000  acres   is the largest protected natural area of sicily  and contains the largest forest in sicily  the caronia  the hundred horse chestnut  castagno dei cento cavalli   in sant alfio  on the eastern slopes of mount etna  is the largest and oldest known chestnut tree in the world at 2,000  – 4,000  years has a good variety of fauna  species include fox  least weasel  pine marten  roe deer  wild boar  crested porcupine  hedgehog  common toad  vipera aspis  golden eagle  peregrine falcon  hoopoe and black-winged  sicily is an important habitat for the survival of several species  an example being the subspecies of hooded crow corvus cornix which is only found in sicily  sardinia and zingaro natural reserve is one of the best examples of unspoiled coastal wilderness in waters including strait of messina are home to varieties of birds and marine life  including larger species such as flamingos and fin whales the original inhabitants of sicily were three defined groups of the ancient peoples of italy  the most prominent and by far the earliest of these was the sicani  who were said by thucydides to have arrived from the iberian peninsula  perhaps important historical evidence has been discovered in the form of cave drawings by the sicani  dated from the end of the pleistocene epoch around 8000  the arrival of the first humans on the island is correlated with the extinction of the sicilian hippopotamus and the dwarf elephant  the elymians  thought to be from the aegean sea  were the next tribe to join the sicanians on discoveries of dolmens on the island  dating to the second half of the third millennium bc  seems to offer new insights into the culture of primitive sicily  it is well known that the mediterranean region went through a quite intricate prehistory  so much so that it is difficult to piece together the muddle of different peoples who have followed each other  the impact of two influences is clear  however  the european one coming from the northwest  and the mediterranean influence of a clear eastern is no evidence of any warring between the tribes  but the sicanians moved eastwards when the elymians settled in the northwest corner of the island  the sicels are thought to have originated in liguria  they arrived from mainland italy in 1200  bc and forced the sicanians to move back across sicily and settle in the middle of the other minor italic groups who settled in sicily were the ausones  aeolian islands  milazzo  and the morgetes of morgantina  studies of genetic records reveal that peoples from various parts of the mediterranean basin mixed with the ancient inhabitants of sicily  including egyptians and phoenician settlements in the western part of the island predates the from about 750  bc  the greeks began to live in sicily  σικελία – sikelia   establishing many important settlements  the most important colony was in syracuse  others were located at akragas  selinunte  gela  himera and the native sicani and sicel peoples were absorbed into the hellenic culture with relative ease  and the area became part of magna graecia along with the rest of southern italy  which the greeks had also colonised  sicily was very fertile  and the successful introduction of olives and grape vines created a great deal of profitable a significant part of greek culture on the island was that of the greek religion  and many temples were built throughout sicily  including several in the valley of the temples at on the island was intertwined with that of greece  syracuse became desired by the athenians who set out on the sicilian expedition during the peloponnesian war  syracuse gained sparta and corinth as allies and  as a result  the athenian expedition was defeated  the athenian army and ships were destroyed  with most of the survivors being sold into syracuse controlled eastern sicily while carthage controlled the the two cultures began to clash  leading to the greek-punic  wars  greece had begun to make peace with the roman republic in 262  bc  and the romans sought to annex sicily as their republic s first province  rome intervened in the first punic war  crushing carthage  so that sicily had become the first roman province outside of the italian peninsula by 242  was killed by the romans after they invaded syracuse in 213  during the second punic war   which saw carthage again trying to take sicily from the roman republic  they failed  and rome was even more unrelenting in its annihilation of the invaders this time  roman consul m  valerian told the roman senate in 210  bc that  no carthaginian remains in served a level of high importance for the romans  as it acted as the empire s granary  it was divided into two quaestorships  in the form of syracuse to the east and lilybaeum to the some attempt was made under augustus to introduce the latin language to the island  but sicily was allowed to remain largely greek in a cultural the once prosperous and contented island went into sharp decline when verres became governor of sicily  in 70  bc  noted figure cicero condemned the misgovernment of verres in his oration in island was used as a base of power numerous times  being occupied by slave insurgents during the first and second servile wars  and by sextus pompey during the sicilian revolt  christianity first appeared in sicily during the years following ad 200;  between this time and ad 313,  constantine the great finally lifted the prohibition on christianity  but not before a significant number of sicilians had become martyrs  including agatha  christina  lucy  and christianity grew rapidly in sicily over the next two centuries  the period of history during which sicily was a roman province lasted for around 700  the western roman empire was falling apart  a germanic tribe known as the vandals briefly took sicily in ad 467-8  under the rule of their king geiseric but in 476  the island was returned to odoacer  who was ruling italy  476-93,  in the name of the byzantine  eastern roman  emperor  the vandals had already invaded parts of roman france  spain  and portugal  asserting themselves as an important power in western however  they soon lost these newly acquired possessions to another east germanic tribe in the form of the the ostrogothic conquest of sicily  and italy as a whole  under theodoric the great began in 488.  the goths were germanic  but theodoric sought to revive roman culture and government and allowed freedom of years later the gothic war (535–554)  began between the ostrogoths and the eastern roman empire  also known as the byzantine empire  sicily was the first part of italy to be taken by general belisarius  who was commissioned by eastern emperor justinian i as part of an ambitious attempt to restore the whole roman empire  thereby uniting the eastern and the western sicily was used as a base for the byzantines to conquer the rest of italy  with naples  rome  milan  and the ostrogoth capital ravenna falling within five however  new ostrogoth king totila drove down the italian peninsula  plundering and conquering sicily in 550.  totila  in turn  was defeated and killed in the battle of taginae by byzantine general narses in 535,  emperor justinian i made sicily a byzantine province and  as in roman times  greek continued to be the predominate language spoken on the island  after the advent of islam  sicily was invaded by the arab forces of caliph uthman in 652,  but the arabs failed to make any permanent gains and returned to syria after gathering some emperor constans ii decided to move from the capital constantinople to syracuse in sicily during 660.  the following year  he launched an assault from sicily against the lombard duchy of benevento  which then occupied most of southern rumors that the capital of the empire was to be moved to syracuse probably cost constans his life  as he was assassinated in his son constantine iv succeeded him  a brief usurpation in sicily by mezezius being quickly suppressed by the new emperor  contemporary accounts report that the greek language was widely spoken on the island during this in 740  emperor leo iii the isaurian transferred sicily from the jurisdiction of the church of rome to that of constantinople  placing the island within the eastern 826,  euphemius  the byzantine commander in sicily  had apparently killed his wife and forced a nun to marry him  emperor michael ii caught wind of the matter and ordered general constantine to end the marriage and cut off euphemius  head  euphemius rose up  killed constantine  and then occupied syracuse  he in turn was defeated and driven out to north he offered the rule of sicily to ziyadat allah  the aghlabid emir of tunisia  in return for a position as a general and a place of safety  a muslim army was then sent to the island consisting of arabs  berbers  cretans  and muslim conquest of sicily was a see-saw  affair and met with much resistance  it took over a century for byzantine sicily to be conquered  the largest city  syracuse  held out until 878  and the greek city of taormina fell in 962.  it was not until 965  that all of sicily was conquered by the in the 11th  century byzantine armies carried out a partial reconquest of the island under george maniakes  but it was their norman mercenaries who would eventually complete the island s reconquest at the end of the century the arabs initiated land reforms  which increased productivity and encouraged the growth of smallholdings  undermining the dominance of the latifundia  the arabs further improved irrigation systems  the language spoken in sicily under arab rule was siculo-arabic  and arabic influence is still present in some sicilian words today  although the language is extinct in sicily  it has developed into what is now the maltese language on the islands of malta today a description of palermo was given by ibn hawqal  an arab merchant who visited sicily in 950.  a walled suburb  called the al-kasr   the palace   is the centre of palermo to this day  with the great friday mosque on the site of the later roman cathedral  the suburb of al-khalisa   modern kalsa  contained the sultan s palace  baths  a mosque  government offices  and a private prison  ibn hawqal reckoned 7,000  individual butchers trading in 150  shops  palermo was initially ruled by the aghlabids  later it was the centre of emirate of sicily under the nominal suzerainty of the fatimid caliphate throughout this reign  revolts by byzantine sicilians continuously occurred  especially in the east  and parts of the island were re-occupied  before being quashed  agricultural items such as oranges  lemons  pistachio and sugarcane were brought to under the arab rule  the island was aligned in three administrative regions  or  vals   roughly corresponding to the three  points  of sicily  val di mazara in the west  val demone in the northeast  and val di noto in the southeast  as dhimmis  the native eastern orthodox christians were allowed freedom of religion  but had to pay a tax  the jizya  and experienced some limitations to actively participate in public affairs the emirate of sicily began to fragment as intra-dynastic  quarrelling fractured the muslim during this time  there was also a minor jewish 1038,  seventy years after losing their last cities in sicily  the byzantines under the greek general george maniakes invaded the island together with their varangian and norman mercenaries  although maniakes was killed in a byzantine civil war in 1043  before completing a reconquest  normans would complete a conquest of sicily from the arabs under roger after taking apulia and calabria  roger occupied messina with an army of 700  knights  in 1068,  roger was victorious at misilmeri  but the most crucial battle was the siege of palermo  which led to most of sicily coming under norman control in the normans finished their conquest in 1091,  when they captured noto  which was the last arab stronghold roger died in 1101  and was succeeded by his son roger ii  who was the first king of sicily  the elder roger was married to adelaide  who ruled until her son came of age in norman hauteville family  who were descendants of vikings  came to appreciate and admire the rich and layered culture in which they now found themselves  and they began implementing their own culture  customs  and politics in the region  many normans in sicily also adopted some of the attributes of muslim rulers and their byzantine subjects in dress  language  literature  and even in the presence of palace eunuchs and  according to some accounts  a the court of roger ii became the most luminous centre of culture in the mediterranean  both from europe and the middle east  like the multi-ethnic  caliphate of córdoba  then only just eclipsed  this attracted scholars  scientists  poets  artists  and artisans of all kinds  laws were issued in the language of the community to whom they were addressed in norman sicily  still with heavy arab and greek the governance was by the rule of law  so there was justice  muslims  jews  byzantine greeks  lombards  and normans worked together to form a society that historians have said created some of the most extraordinary buildings that the world has ever continued on as the capital under the normans  roger s son roger ii of sicily succeeded his brother simon of sicily as count of sicily  and was ultimately able to raise the status of the island to a kingdom in 1130,  along with his other holdings  which included the maltese islands and the duchies of apulia and he appointed the powerful greek george of antioch to be his  emir of emir s  and continued the syncretism of his father  during this period  the kingdom of sicily was prosperous and politically powerful  becoming one of the wealthiest states in all of europe—even wealthier than the kingdom of immigrants from northern italy and campania arrived during this period  linguistically  the island shifted from being one third greek and two thirds arabic speaking at the time of the norman conquest to becoming fully in terms of the church  it became completely roman catholic  previously  it had been eastern orthodox under the a century  the norman hauteville dynasty died out  the last direct descendant and heir of roger  constance  married emperor henry this eventually led to the crown of sicily being passed on to the hohenstaufen dynasty  who were germans from swabia  the last of the hohenstaufens  frederick ii  the only son of constance  was one of the greatest and most cultured men of the middle ages  his mother s will had asked pope innocent iii to undertake the guardianship of her son  the pope gladly accepted the role  as it allowed him to detach sicily from the rest of the holy roman empire  thus ending the spectre of the papal states being surrounded  frederick was four when  at palermo  he was crowned king of sicily in 1198.  frederick received no systematic education and was allowed to run free in the streets of palermo  there he picked up the many languages he heard spoken  such as arabic and greek  and learned some of the lore of the jewish community  at age twelve  he dismissed innocent s deputy regent and took over the government  at fifteen he married constance of aragon  and began his reclamation of the imperial crown  subsequently  due to muslim rebellions  frederick ii destroyed the arab presence in sicily  moving all the muslims of sicily to the city of lucera in apulia between 1221  and between the hohenstaufen house and the papacy led  in 1266,  to pope innocent iv crowning the french prince charles  count of anjou and provence  as the king of both sicily and opposition to french officialdom due to mistreatment and taxation saw the local peoples of sicily rise up  leading in 1282  to an insurrection known as the war of the sicilian vespers  which eventually saw almost the entire french population on the island during the war  the sicilians turned to peter iii of aragon  son-in-law  of the last hohenstaufen king  for support after being rejected by the pope  peter gained control of sicily from the french  who  however  retained control of the kingdom of naples  a crusade was launched in august 1283  against peter iii and the aragon kingdom by pope martin iv  a pope from île-de-france),  but it failed  the wars continued until the peace of caltabellotta in 1302,  which saw peter s son frederick iii recognised as king of the isle of sicily  while charles ii was recognised as the king of naples by pope boniface sicily was ruled as an independent kingdom by relatives of the kings of aragon until 1409  and then as part of the crown of in october 1347,  in messina  sicily  the black death first arrived in onset of the spanish inquisition in 1492  led to ferdinand ii decreeing the expulsion of all jews from the eastern part of the island was hit by very destructive earthquakes in 1542  and 1693.  just a few years before the latter earthquake  the island was struck by a ferocious the earthquake in 1693  took an estimated 60,000  there were revolts during the 17th  century  but these were quelled with significant force  especially the revolts of palermo and north african slave raids discouraged settlement along the coast until the 19th  the treaty of utrecht in 1713  saw sicily assigned to the house of savoy  however  this period of rule lasted only seven years  as it was exchanged for the island of sardinia with emperor charles vi of the austrian habsburg the austrians were concerned with the war of the polish succession  a bourbon prince  charles from spain was able to conquer sicily and at first sicily was able to remain as an independent kingdom under personal union  while the bourbons ruled over both from naples  however  the advent of napoleon s first french empire saw naples taken at the battle of campo tenese and bonapartist king of naples were installed  ferdinand iii the bourbon was forced to retreat to sicily which he was still in complete control of with the help of british naval this  sicily joined the napoleonic wars  and subsequently the british under lord william bentinck established a military and diplomatic presence on the island to protect against a french invasion  after the wars were won  sicily and naples formally merged as the two sicilies under the bourbons  major revolutionary movements occurred in 1820  and 1848  against the bourbon government with sicily seeking independence  the second of which  the 1848  revolution resulted in a short period of independence for sicily  however  in 1849  the bourbons retook the control of the island and dominated it until expedition of the thousand led by giuseppe garibaldi captured sicily in 1860,  as part of the the conquest started at marsala  and native sicilians joined him in the capture of the southern italian peninsula  garibaldi s march was completed with the siege of gaeta  where the final bourbons were expelled and garibaldi announced his dictatorship in the name of victor emmanuel ii of kingdom of sicily became part of the kingdom of sardinia after a referendum where more than 75%  of sicily voted in favour of the annexation on 21  october 1860   but not everyone was allowed to vote   as a result of the kingdom of italy proclamation  sicily became part of the kingdom on 17  march 1861.the  sicilian economy  and the wider mezzogiorno economy  remained relatively underdeveloped after the italian unification  in spite of the strong investments made by the kingdom of italy in terms of modern infrastructure  and this caused an unprecedented wave of in 1894,  organisations of workers and peasants known as the fasci siciliani protested against the bad social and economic conditions of the island  but they were suppressed in a few the messina earthquake of 28  december 1908  killed more than 80,000  this period was also characterised by the first contact between the sicilian mafia  the crime syndicate also known as cosa nostra  and the italian government  the mafia s origins are still uncertain  but it is generally accepted that it emerged in the 18th  century initially in the role of private enforcers hired to protect the property of landowners and merchants from the groups of bandits  briganti  who frequently pillaged the countryside and towns  the battle against the mafia made by the kingdom of italy was controversial and ambiguous  the carabinieri  the military police of italy  and sometimes the italian army were often involved in terrible fights against the mafia members  but their efforts were frequently useless because of the secret co-operation  between mafia and local government and also because of the weakness of the italian judicial the 1920s,  the fascist regime began a stronger military action against the mafia  which was led by prefect cesare mori who was known as the  iron prefect  because of his iron-fisted  campaigns  this was the first time in which an operation against the sicilian mafia ended with considerable there was an allied invasion of sicily during world war ii starting on 10  july 1943.  in preparation for the invasion  the allies revitalized the mafia to aid them  the invasion of sicily contributed to the 25  july crisis  in general  the allied victors were warmly embraced by became a republic in 1946  and  as part of the constitution of italy  sicily was one of the five regions given special status as an autonomous both the partial italian land reform and special funding from the italian government s cassa per il mezzogiorno  fund for the south  from 1950  to 1984  helped the sicilian economy  during this period  the economic and social condition of the island was generally improved thanks to important investments on infrastructures such as motorways and airports  and thanks to the creation of important industrial and commercial in the 1980s,  the mafia was deeply weakened by a second important campaign led by magistrates giovanni falcone and paolo between 1990  and 2005,  the unemployment rate fell from about 23%  to is a melting pot of a variety of different cultures and ethnicities  including the original italic people  the phoenicians  carthaginians  greeks  romans  byzantines  saracens  normans  swabians  aragonese  lombards  spaniards  french  and albanians  each contributing to the island s culture and genetic makeup  about five million people live in sicily  making it the fourth most populated region in italy  in the first century after the italian unification  sicily had one of the most negative net migration rates among the regions of italy because of the emigration of millions of people to other european countries  north america  south america and australia  like the south of italy and sardinia  immigration to the island is very low compared to other regions of italy because workers tend to head to northern italy instead  due to better employment and industrial opportunities  the most recent istat show around 175,000  immigrants out of the total of almost 5.1  million population  nearly 3.5%  of the population   romanians with more than 50,000  make up the most immigrants  followed by tunisians  moroccans  sri lankans  albanians  and others mostly from eastern in citation given  as

other germanic peoples left a contribution of around 8%  on the paternal side  haplogroup i   a recent genetic study of southern italian and sicilian populations has shown that sicilians are very similar in genetic makeup to mainlander italians from the adjacent regions of calabria  basilicata and outside of italy  according to one study  greeks from crete  laconia  and peloponese are genetically closest to according to another study  sicilians were closest to other southern italians and greeks from crete and the aegean islands  but distinct from all mainland sicily there are two historical ethno-linguistic  minorities  the lombards of sicily and the arbëreshë the politics of sicily takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democracy  whereby the president of regional government is the head of government  and of a pluriform multi-party  system  executive power is exercised by the regional government  legislative power is vested in both the government and the sicilian regional assembly  the capital of sicily is palermo traditionally  sicily gives centre-right  results during from 1943  to 1951  there was also a separatist political party called sicilian independence movement  movimento indipendentista siciliano  mis   its best electoral result was in the 1946  general election  when mis obtained 0.7%  of national votes (8.8%  of votes in sicily   and four seats  however  the movement lost all its seats following the 1948  general election and the 1951  regional election  even though it has never been formally disbanded  today the movement is no longer part of the politics of sicily  after world war ii sicily became a stronghold of the christian democracy  in opposition to the italian communist party  the communists and their successors  the democratic party of the left  the democrats of the left and the present-day  democratic party  had never won in the region until 2012.  sicily is now governed by a centre-left  coalition between democratic party and the centre-party  union of christian and centre democrats  rosario crocetta is the current president since sicily is divided into nine provinces  each with a capital city of the same name as the province  small surrounding islands are also part of various sicilian provinces  the aeolian islands  messina   isle of ustica  palermo   aegadian islands  trapani

seen sicily is to not have seen italy at all  for sicily is the clue to everything sicily has long been associated with the arts  many poets  writers  philosophers  intellectuals  architects and painters have roots on the island  the history of prestige in this field can be traced back to greek philosopher archimedes  a syracuse native who has gone on to become renowned as one of the greatest mathematicians of all gorgias and empedocles are two other highly noted early sicilian-greek  philosophers  while the syracusan epicharmus is held to be the inventor of ceramics from the island are

antonello da messina  renato guttuso and greek born giorgio de chirico who is commonly dubbed the  father of surrealist art  and founder of the metaphysical art the most noted architects are filippo juvarra  one of the most important figures of the italian baroque  and ernesto basile the sicilian baroque has a unique architectural identity  noto  caltagirone  catania  ragusa  modica  scicli and particularly acireale contain some of italy s best examples of baroque architecture  carved in the local red sandstone  noto provides one of the best examples of the baroque architecture brought to sicily the baroque style in sicily was largely confined to buildings erected by the church  and palazzi built as private residences for the sicilian the earliest examples of this style in sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy-handed  pastiches of buildings seen by sicilian visitors to rome  florence  and naples  however  even at this early stage  provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of sicily s older architecture  by the middle of the 18th  century  when sicily s baroque architecture was noticeably different from that of the mainland  it typically included at least two or three of the following features  coupled with a unique freedom of design that is more difficult to characterise in words palermo hosts the teatro massimo which is the largest opera house in italy and the third largest in all of in catania there is another important opera house  the teatro massimo bellini with 1,200  seats  which is considered one of the best european opera houses for its acoustics  sicily s composers vary from vincenzo bellini  sigismondo d india  giovanni pacini and alessandro scarlatti  to contemporary composers such as salvatore

include gaetano mosca and giovanni gentile who wrote the doctrine of fascism  in terms of academic reflection  the historical and aesthetic richness as well as the multi-layered  heterogeneity of sicilian literature and culture have been first grasped methodologically and coined with the term of transculturality by german scholar of italian studies dagmar reichardt who  after having published an extensive study on the literary work of giuseppe was awarded the international premio flaiano   italianistica   for a trilingual  english  italian  german  collection about the european liminality of sicily  sicilian literature and sicilian in sicily most people are bilingual and speak both italian and sicilian  a distinct and historical romance language  some of the sicilian words are loan words from greek  catalan  french  arabic  spanish and other dialects related to sicilian are also spoken in calabria and salento  it had a significant influence on the maltese language  however the use of sicilian is limited to informal contexts  mostly in family  and in a majority of cases it is replaced by the so-called  regional italian of sicily  an italian dialect that is a kind of mix between italian and was an early influence in the development of the first italian standard  although its use remained confined to an intellectual elite  this was a literary language in sicily created under the auspices of frederick ii and his court of notaries  or magna curia  which  headed by giacomo da lentini  also gave birth to the sicilian school  widely inspired by troubadour literature  its linguistic and poetic heritage was later assimilated into the florentine by dante alighieri  the father of modern italian who  in his de vulgari eloquentia  claims that  in effect this vernacular seems to deserve a higher praise than the others  since all the poetry written by italians can be called it is in this language that appeared the first sonnet  whose invention is attributed to giacomo da lentini himself catania has one of the four laboratories of the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare  national institute for nuclear physics  in which there is a cyclotron that uses protons both

years and possibly for more than 2,000  years  some scholars believe that the sicilian jewry are partial ancestors of the ashkenazi however  much of the jewish community faded away when they were expelled from the island in 1492.  islam was present during the emirate of sicily  although muslims were also expelled  today  mostly due to immigration to the island  there are also several religious minorities  such as jehovah s witnesses  islam  judaism  and sikhism  there are also a fair number of evangelical church members and practitioners who reside on the island the island has a long history of producing a variety of noted cuisines and wines  to the extent that sicily is sometimes nicknamed god s kitchen because of every part of sicily has its speciality  for example cassata is

region  the triskelion is also featured on greek coins of syracuse  such as coins of agathocles (317–289  bc  the symbol dates back to when sicily was part of magna graecia  the colonial extension of greece beyond the the triskelion was revived  as a neoclassic – and non-bourbon  – emblem for the new napoleonic kingdom of the two sicilies  by joachim murat in 1808.  pliny the elder attributes the origin of the triskelion of sicily to the triangular form of the island  the ancient trinacria  which consists of three large capes equidistant from each other  pointing in their respective directions  the names of which were pelorus  pachynus  and lilybæum  the three legs of the triskelion are also reminiscent of hephaestus s three-legged  tables that ran by themselves  as mentioned in iliad xviii
