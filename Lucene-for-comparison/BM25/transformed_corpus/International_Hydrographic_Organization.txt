 international hydrographic organization -  wikipediathe international hydrographic organization  iho  is the inter-governmental  organisation representing hydrography a principal aim of the iho is to ensure that the worldâ€™s seas  oceans and navigable waters are properly surveyed and charted  it does this through the setting of international standards  the co-ordination  of the endeavours of the world s national hydrographic offices  and through its capacity building programme the iho enjoys observer status at the united nations where it is the recognised competent authority on hydrographic surveying and nautical charting  when referring to hydrography and nautical charting in conventions and similar instruments  it is the iho standards and specifications that are normally used the iho was established in 1921  as the international hydrographic bureau  ihb   the present name was adopted in 1970  as part of a new international convention on the iho adopted by the then member nations  the former name international hydrographic bureau was retained to describe the iho secretariat until 8  november 2016,  when a revision to the convention on the iho entered into force  thereafter the ihb became known as the  iho secretariat   comprising an elected secretary-general  and two supporting directors  together with a small staff of 17,  at the organization s headquarters in monaco during the 19th  century  many maritime nations established hydrographic offices to provide means for improving the navigation of naval and merchant vessels by providing nautical publications  nautical charts  and other navigational services  there were substantial differences in hydrographic procedures charts  and publications  in 1889,  an international maritime conference was held at washington  d c   and it was proposed to establish a  permanent international commission   similar proposals were made at the sessions of the international congress of navigation held at saint petersburg in 1908  and the international maritime conference held at saint petersburg in 1912.in  1919  the hydrographers of great britain and france cooperated in taking the necessary steps to convene an international conference of hydrographers  london was selected as the most suitable place for this conference  and on 24  july 1919,  the first international conference opened  attended by the hydrographers of 24  nations  the object of the conference was  to consider the advisability of all maritime nations adopting similar methods in preparation  construction  and production of their charts and all hydrographic publications  of rendering the results in the most convenient form to enable them to be readily used  of instituting a prompt system of mutual exchange of hydrographic information between all countries  and of providing an opportunity to consultations and discussions to be carried out on hydrographic subjects generally by the hydrographic experts of the world   this is still the major purpose of the iho as a result of the conference  a permanent organization was formed and statutes for its operations were prepared  the ihb  now the iho  began its activities in 1921  with 18  nations as members  the principality of monaco was selected as the seat of the organization as a result of the offer of albert i  prince of monaco to provide suitable accommodation for the bureau in the principality the iho develops hydrographic and nautical charting standards  these standards are subsequently adopted and used by its 87  member countries and others in their surveys  nautical charts  and publications  the almost universal use of the iho standards means that the products and services provided by the world s national hydrographic and oceanographic offices are consistent and recognisable by all seafarers and for other users  much has been done in the field of standardisation since the bureau  now the iho  was founded the iho has encouraged the formation of regional hydrographic commissions  rhcs   each rhc coordinates the national surveying and charting activities of countries within each region and acts as a forum to address other matters of common hydrographic interest  the 15  rhcs plus the iho hydrographic commission on antarctica  hca  effectively cover the world the iho  in partnership with the intergovernmental oceanographic commission  ioc   directs the general bathymetric chart of the oceans programme most iho publications  including the standards  guidelines and associated documents such as the international hydrographic review  international hydrographic bulletin  the hydrographic dictionary and the year book are available to the general public free of charge from the iho website the iho publishes the international standards related to charting and hydrography  including s-57,  iho transfer standard for digital hydrographic data  the encoding standard that is used primarily for electronic navigational charts  in 2010  the iho introduced a new  contemporary hydrographic geospatial standard for modelling marine data and information  known as s-100.  s-100  and any dependent product specifications are underpinned by an on-line  registry accessible via the iho website  s-100  is aligned with the iso 19100  series of geographic standards  thereby making it fully compatible with contemporary geospatial data standards  because s-100  is based on iso 19100,  it can be used by other data providers for their maritime-related  (non-hydrographic)  data and information  various data and information providers from both the government and private sector are now using s-100  as part of the implementation of the e-navigation  concept that has been endorsed by the un international maritime organisation the iho maintains a programme of the meetings of its council  committees and working groups around the world  the meetings and the meetings of other related international organisations are promulgated in the calendar on the iho following countries are members of the iho
