 cyclone rewa -  wikipediasevere tropical cyclone rewa affected six countries and caused 22  deaths on its 28-day  journey across the south pacific ocean in december 1993  and january 1994.  cyclone rewa developed from a tropical disturbance on 28  december south of nauru  after forming  rewa moved southwest through the solomon islands  crossing the 160th  meridian east from the south pacific basin into the australian region  the cyclone began to strengthen steadily and turned southward  paralleling the eastern australian coast through 31  december  rewa reached its initial peak intensity as a category 4  tropical cyclone on 2  january  it maintained this intensity for about 12  hours before an increase in wind shear induced its weakening by 3  january  the cyclone turned southeastward and moved back into the south pacific basin on 4  january  before it passed over new caledonia between 5–6  january  after affecting new caledonia  rewa weakened to a tropical depression and turned northwestward before re-entering  the australian basin on 10  january over the following days  the cyclone showed signs of restrengthening and executed an elongated cyclonic loop to the southeast of papua new guinea  rewa subsequently entered a phase of quick intensification while proceeding southeastward  peaking in intensity as a category 5  severe tropical cyclone  it recurved toward the southwest while gradually weakening for several days  although forecasters had predicted rewa to make landfall near mackay  queensland  the cyclone began interacting with an upper-level  trough on 18  january  causing it to divert to the southeast and move along the queensland coast  rewa transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on 20  january  with its remnants bringing heavy rain to new zealand three days later the cyclone caused the deaths of 22  people on its course  affecting parts of the solomon islands  papua new guinea  eastern australia  new caledonia  vanuatu and new zealand  nine people in a banana dinghy en route to rossel island went missing at the height of the storm  they were presumed drowned after wreckage from their boat turned up at the island  in queensland  three people died in traffic accidents caused by the storm  and another fatality occurred when a boy became trapped in a storm pipe  one death took place in new caledonia  while flooding caused eight drownings in papua new guinea  after this usage of the name rewa  the name was retired during 26  december  the fiji meteorological service started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed within the intertropical convergence zone  about 575  km (355  mi  to the south-east  of over the next few days the depression gradually developed and organised further  as it moved towards the west-southwest  under the influence of a north-easterly  steering during 28  december  the jtwc classified the depression as tropical cyclone 05p,  before the fms named it rewa as it had become a category 1  tropical cyclone on the australian tropical cyclone intensity over the next few days  the system gradually intensified under the influence of favourable upper-level  winds while it moved towards the south-southwest,  passing through the solomon islands on 29  december and affecting the southeastern islands of papua new as it moved through the solomon islands  rewa moved out of the south pacific basin and into the australian region  where the australian bureau of meteorology  bom  took the primary warning responsibility for the 30  december  the jtwc reported that rewa had become equivalent to a category 1  hurricane on the saffir-simpson  hurricane scale  sshs   early the next day the bom reported that the system had developed into a category 3  severe tropical cyclone  and an eye became visible on satellite the system then abruptly turned and started to move towards the south parallel to the queensland coast because of an interaction with an upper-level  trough of low on 2  january both the jtwc and the bom reported that rewa had reached its peak intensity  with the jtwc reporting that rewa had peaked with 1-minute  windspeeds of 230  km h (145  mph   equivalent to a category 4  hurricane on the meanwhile  the bom reported that the system had peaked with 10-minute  windspeeds of 205  km h (125  mph  with a central pressure of 920  hectopascals (27.17  inhg   which made it a category 5  severe tropical cyclone on the australian rewa remained at its peak intensity for 24  hours before the system started to weaken during 3  january  as strengthening upper level north-westerlies  increased vertical wind shear over the throughout that day  the cyclone started to move towards the south-east,  before it started to take a more eastwards track as it approached 4  january  rewa moved back into the south pacific basin and continued eastward as a weakening category 3  severe tropical cyclone  with the fms estimating the 10-minute  sustained windspeeds at 150  km h (90  during the next day  its eye became obscured after the mountains of new caledonia affected rewa s circulation by creating a hot and dry foehn the fms reported that the system had weakened into a category 2  tropical cyclone  while the jtwc reported that rewa had become a tropical the system subsequently made landfall in the vicinity of saint vincent bay on new caledonia s south-western  coast  before it emerged near thio from the east coast during 6  by 7  january  rewa s circulation had become exposed under the influence of upper level north-westerlies;  as a result both the fms and jtwc reported that rewa had weakened into a over the next 3  days  the residual low-level  circulation was steered towards the northwest and papua new guinea in a southeasterly trade wind flow generated by a powerful area of high pressure located between new zealand and kermadec during 10  january  rewa s remnants moved out of the south pacific basin and back into the australian region while starting to re-intensify  into a tropical cyclone  as a mid to upper level trough over eastern australia increased in moved into the australian region  rewa began to move in a long arc to the northwest and then to the north  and on 13  january  both the jtwc and the papua new guinea national weather service reported that the system had re-intensified  into a tropical cyclone around papua new guinea s southern later that day  rewa executed a sharp clockwise turn near tagula island and started to move towards the southeast and the bom s area of responsibility while gradually intensifying during 15  january  the bom reported that the system had re-intensified  into a category 3  severe tropical cyclone  while the jtwc reported that rewa had become equivalent to a category 1  hurricane later that day  the system started to rapidly intensify as an upper level trough approached the system  during the next day the jtwc reported that the system had peaked with 1-minute  sustained windspeeds of 230  km h (145  the bom then reported later that day  that rewa had peaked with 10-minute  sustained windspeeds of 205  km h (125  mph   which made it a category 5  severe tropical cyclone on the australian tropical cyclone intensity after it had peaked in intensity the system recurved towards the south-southwest,  and started to gradually by 18  january the jtwc reported that rewa had weakened into a tropical storm  while throughout that day the bom assessed rewa as a category 3  severe tropical during the next day  the bom reported that rewa had weakened into a category 2  tropical cyclone as it recurved and started to move towards the south-east  about 265  km (165  mi  to the east of mackay  over the next couple of days the system moved towards the south-southeast  along the queensland coast while maintaining its during 21  january  the bom and the jtwc reported that rewa had weakened below cyclone strength  as the system moved back into the south pacific basin for the third and final rewa s remnants were last noted late on 23  january  by new zealand s metservice  bringing heavy rain to new zealand  while dissipating over water about 400  km (250  mi  to the east of wellington  new people lost their lives in accidents caused by cyclone rewa  while it affected parts off the solomon islands  papua new guinea  australia  new caledonia  vanuatu and new due to the impact of this storm  the name rewa was solomon islands were affected by the developing tropical cyclone between 28  – 30  december and was the first island country to be impacted by as it developed into a tropical cyclone on 28  december  the system passed to the north of the outer lying atolls of malaita province in the solomon islands  rewa then passed over the southern tip of malaita island  before passing to the south of guadalcanal island and the north of rennell island during 29  rewa started to affect new caledonia on 5  january  before it passed over grand terre island later that rewa dumped over 300  mm (12  in  of rain on parts of the archipelago  which made all of the major rivers overflow and burst their several landslides and a death were recorded within new caledonia  while on the loyalty island of mare  waves from rewa partially destroyed the harbour wall at tadine s system had no effect on vanuatu while it passed through the solomon islands between 28  – 30  december  however the southern islands of vanuatu were affected by the cyclone after it had passed through new caledonia during 5  as it moved towards the north-west  between 6–8  january  rewa brought high seas and strong winds to parts of the island nation including the provinces of shefa and some damage was recorded to port villa s harbours intertidal zone  as the system passed about 175  km (110  mi  to the southeast of the 19–24  january  rewa s remnants  a slow moving weather front over fiordland and a southerly brought widespread rainfall and flooding to new zealand s south in westland  fiordland and the southern lakes  landslides and flooding occurred on 21  january  while several roads and bridges were rewa affected papua new guinea on two separate occasions while it was active  with the cyclone first affecting the archipelago between 28  december and 1  january  before grazing the archipelago between 12-14  before rewa affected the country  cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for sudest  rossel and samarai islands  while authorities urged people not to go to as it affected the archipelago  rewa brought heavy rainfall  high seas  and wind gusts of up to 100  km h (60  mph  to parts of the archipelago including sudest  rossel and samarai the hardest hit areas were communities near major river systems  with the cyclone blocking roads  destroying a church  bridges  homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and copra in total  cyclone rewa left around 3500  people homeless and caused 17  deaths  8  of which were due to nine other people went missing while travelling to rossel island after their boat was caught up in high seas associated with they were later presumed dead by the national disaster and emergency service  after a local search and rescue mission found wreckage of the at 00:00  utc on 30  december  the automatic weather station at jingo on rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55  km h (35  the opening days of 1994,  rewa moved southwards parallel to the queensland coast  however  because it was located about 600  km (370  mi  to the north-east  of mackay  it was too far away from the coast for there to be any direct impact on the only indirect impact was higher surf  from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards new caledonia during 4  as rewa affected queensland for the second time  watches and warnings were issued for various parts of queensland by tcwc brisbane  who predicted a landfall near on 18  january local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people  while people who were on vacation in national parks were alerted about rewa by a a military training exercise that was due to take place in shoalwater bay had to be cancelled  with army personal evacuated to rockhampton to avoid being cut off by flood along the coast  several ports including gladstone were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the 19  january rewa started to affect queensland with torrential rain and storm force windspeeds which caused some damage along the however it did not make its predicted landfall near mackay  instead it recurved to the south-southeast  and came to within 100  km (60  mi  of the two men off yeppoon s coast were rescued from a fishing trawler by an army black hawk helicopter after high seas damaged the trawler s propeller and snapped its heavy anchor chain  leaving it drifting helplessly in the cyclone s the worst affected island was lady elliot as it bore the brunt of the wind  while on heron island  several rare trees and bird rookeries were either destroyed or severely damaged  as rewa interacted with an upper trough of low pressure on 19  january  heavy rainfall and thunderstorms were observed in parts of brisbane and the gold brisbane received over 144  mm (5.7  in  in just six hours  which led to some localised flash flooding in parts of the city and four three of the deaths were from people crashing their cars  while the other death occurred when a person went surfing brisbane s flood water and got trapped in a storm within brisbane  100  homes and 20  cars were damaged by the flood waters  while a sheffield shield cricket match between western australia and queensland was delayed  after the gabba resembled a small
