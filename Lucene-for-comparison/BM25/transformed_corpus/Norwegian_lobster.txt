 nephrops norvegicus -  wikipedianephrops norvegicus  known variously as the norway lobster  dublin bay prawn  langoustine  compare langostino  or scampi  is a slim  orange-pink  lobster which grows up to 25  cm (10  in  long  and is  the most important commercial crustacean in it is now the only extant species in the genus nephrops  after several other species were moved to the closely related genus metanephrops  it lives in the north-eastern  atlantic ocean  and parts of the mediterranean sea  but is absent from the baltic sea and black sea  adults emerge from their burrows at night to feed on worms and fish nephrops norvegicus has the typical body shape of a lobster  albeit narrower than the large homarus it is pale orange in colour  and grows to a typical length of 18–20  centimetres (7–8  in   or exceptionally 25  cm (10  in  long  including the tail and a carapace covers the animal s cephalothorax  while the abdomen is long and segmented  ending in a broad tail the first three pairs of legs bear claws  of which the first are greatly elongated and bear ridges of of the two pairs of antennae  the second is the longer and there is a long  spinous rostrum  and the compound eyes are kidney-shaped,  providing the name of the genus  from the greek roots νεφρός  nephros   kidney   and ops norvegicus is found in the north-eastern  atlantic ocean and north sea as far north as iceland and northern norway  and south to portugal  it is not common in the mediterranean sea except in the adriatic notably the north it is absent from both the black sea and the baltic due to its ecological demands for particular sediments  n  norvegicus has a very patchy distribution  and is divided into over 30  populations  these populations are separated by inhospitable terrain  and adults rarely travel distances greater than a few hundred norvegicus adults prefer to inhabit muddy seabed sediments  with more than 40  percent silt and their burrows are and vary in structure and size  typical burrows are 20  to 30  centimetres (8  to 12  in  deep  with a distance of 50  to 80  centimetres (20  to 31  in  between the front and back norway lobsters spend most of their time either lying in their burrows or by the entrance  only leaving their shelters to forage or norvegicus is a scavenger and that makes short foraging mainly during periods of subdued light  they feed on active prey  including worms and which they capture with their chelipeds and walking legs  and food is conveyed to the mouth using the anterior walking legs  assisted by the norvegicus is the host to a number of parasites and symbionts  a number of sessile organisms attach to the exoskeleton of n  norvegicus  including the barnacle balanus crenatus and the foraminiferan cyclogyra  but overall nephrops suffers fewer infestations of such epibionts than other decapod crustaceans in december 1995,  the commensal symbion pandora was discovered attached to the mouthparts of nephrops norvegicus  and was found to be the first member of a new phylum  a finding described by simon conway morris as  the zoological highlight of the s  pandora has been found in many populations of n  norvegicus  both in the north atlantic and in the mediterranean individuals may be found on most segments of the lobster s mouthparts  but are generally concentrated on the central parts of the larger mouthparts  from the mandible to the third most significant parasite of n  norvegicus is a dinoflagellate of the genus hematodinium  which has caused epidemic infection in fished populations of n  norvegicus since the hematodinium is a genus that contains major pathogens of a wide variety of decapod crustaceans  although its internal taxonomy is poorly the species which attacks n  norvegicus causes a syndrome originally described as "post-moult  syndrome   in which the carapace turns opaque and becomes highly pigmented  the haemolymph becomes milky white  and the animal appears other parasites of n  norvegicus include the gregarine protozoan porospora nephropis  the trematode stichocotyle nephropis and the polychaete histriobdella typical life span of n  norvegicus is 5–10  reaching 15  years in exceptional its reproductive cycle varies depending on geographical position   the periods of hatching and spawning  and the length of the incubation period  vary with latitude and the breeding cycle changes from annual to biennial as one moves from south to incubation of eggs is temperature-dependent,  and in colder climates  the duration of the incubation period increases  this means that  by the time hatching occurs  it may be too late for the females to take part in that year s breeding cycle  in warmer climates  the combined effects of recovery from moulting and ovary maturation mean that spawning can become delayed  this  in turn  has the effect of the female missing out a year of egg male nephrops norvegicus moult once or twice a year  usually in late winter or spring  and adult females moult up to once a year  in late winter or spring  after hatching of the in annual breeding cycles  mating takes place in the spring or winter  when the females are in the soft  post-moult  the ovaries mature throughout the spring and summer months  and egg-laying  takes place in late summer or early autumn  after spawning  the berried (egg-carrying)  females return to their burrows and remain there until the end of the incubation period  hatching takes place in late winter or early spring  soon after hatching  the females moult and mate the planktonic larval stage  typically 1  to 2  months in duration  the nephrops larvae exhibit a diel vertical migration behaviour as they are dispersed by the local currents  this complex biophysical interaction determines the fate of the larvae  the overlap between advective pathway destination and spatial distributions of suitable benthic habitats must be favourable in order for the larvae to settle and reach muscular tail of nephrops norvegicus is frequently eaten  and its meat is known as scampi  the n  norvegicus is eaten only on special occasions in spain and portugal  where it is less expensive than the common lobster  homarus n  norvegicus is an important species for fisheries  being caught mostly by trawling  around 60,000  tonnes are caught annually  half of it in the united kingdom s the established trawling fleets  a significant number of fleets using lobster creels have developed  the better size and condition of lobsters caught by this method yield prices three to four times higher than animals netted by trawling  creel fishing was found to have a reduced impact on the seafloor  require lower fuel consumption  and allow fishermen with smaller boats to participate in this high-value  fishery  it has therefore been described as a reasonable alternative to demersal towed gears  and the allocation of additional fishing rights for this type of take has been north east atlantic individual biological stocks of nephrops are identified as functional units  a number of functional units make up the sea areas over which a total allowable catch  tac  is set annually by the eu council of ministers  for example  the tac set for north sea nephrops is based on the aggregate total tonnage of removals recommended by science for nine separate functional unit areas  this method has attracted criticism because it can promote the over-exploitation  of a specific functional unit even though the overall tac is under-fished.  in 2016,  the uk implemented a package of emergency technical measures aimed at recovering the nephrop stock in the farn e  deeps off north east england which is close to collapse  a 2017  assessment performed by the international council for the exploration of the sea  ices  indicates the beginning of biomass expansion  but that controls on fishing effort will need to continue at least until the biomass reaches a size that is sustainable when measured against the level of fishing activity by all fishers wanting to target the from nephrops fishery may account for up to 37%  of the energy requirements of certain marine scavengers  such as the hagfish myxine boats involved in nephrops fishery also catch a number of fish species such as plaice and sole  and it is thought that without that revenue  nephrops fishery would be economically norvegicus was one of the
