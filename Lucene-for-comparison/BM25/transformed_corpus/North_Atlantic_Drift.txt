 north atlantic current -  wikipediathe north atlantic current  nac   also known as north atlantic drift and north atlantic sea movement  is a powerful warm western boundary current that extends the gulf stream nac originates from where the gulf stream turns north at the southeast newfoundland rise  a submarine ridge that stretches south-east  from the grand banks  the nac flows northward east of the grand banks  from 40°n  to 51°n,  before turning sharply east to cross the atlantic  it transports more warm tropical water to northern latitudes than any other boundary current  more than 40  sv in the south and 20  sv as it crosses the mid-atlantic  ridge  it reaches speeds of 2  knots near the north american coast  directed by topography  the nac meanders heavily but  in contrast to the meanders of the gulf stream  the nac meanders remain stable without breaking off into colder parts of the gulf stream turn northward near the  tail  of the grand banks at 50°w  where the azores current branches off to flow south of the azores  from there the nac flows north-eastward  east of the flemish cap (47°n,  45°w).  approaching the mid-atlantic  ridge  it then turns eastward and becomes much broader and more diffuse  it then splits into a colder  north-eastern  branch and a warmer eastern branch  as the warmer branch turns southward most of the subtropical component of the gulf stream has been diverted southward and  as a consequence  the north atlantic is mostly supplied by subpolar waters  including a contribution from the labrador current recirculated into the nac at of continental europe  it splits into two major branches  one branch goes southeast  later to become the canary current as it passes northwest africa and turns southwest  the other major branch continues north along the coast of northwestern europe  other branches include the irminger current and the norwegian current  driven by the global thermohaline circulation  thc   the north atlantic current is part of the wind-driven  gulf stream  which goes further east and north from the north american coast across the atlantic and into the arctic ocean the north atlantic current  together with the gulf stream  have a long-lived  reputation for having a considerable warming influence on european climate  the principal cause for differences in winter climate between north america and europe is  however  winds rather than ocean
