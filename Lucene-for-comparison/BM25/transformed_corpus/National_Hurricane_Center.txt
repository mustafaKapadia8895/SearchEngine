 national hurricane center -  wikipediathe national hurricane center  nhc  is the division of the united states  national weather service responsible for tracking and predicting weather systems within the tropics between the prime meridian and the 140th  meridian west poleward to the 30th  parallel north in the northeast pacific ocean and the 31st  parallel north in the northern atlantic ocean  the agency  which is co-located  with the miami branch of the national weather service  is situated on the campus of florida international university in university park  tropical analysis and forecast branch  tafb  routinely issues marine forecasts  in the form of graphics and high seas forecasts  for this area year round  with the ocean prediction center having backup responsibility for this unit  the technology and science branch  tsb  provides technical support for the center  which includes new infusions of technology from abroad  the chief  aerial reconnaissance coordination  all hurricanes  carcah  unit tasks planes  for research and operational purposes  to tropical cyclones during the atlantic hurricane season and significant weather events  including snow storms  during winter and spring  research to improve operational forecasts is done through the hurricane forecast improvement project  hfip  and joint hurricane test bed  jht  initiatives during the atlantic and northeast pacific hurricane seasons  the hurricane specialists unit  hsu  issues routine tropical weather outlooks for the northeast pacific and northern atlantic oceans  when tropical storm or hurricane conditions are expected within 48  hours  the center issues watches and warnings via the news media and national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa  weather radio although the nhc is an agency of the united states  the world meteorological organization has designated it as regional specialized meteorological center for the north atlantic and eastern pacific  making it the clearinghouse for tropical cyclone forecasts and observations occurring in these areas  if the center loses power or becomes incapacitated  the central pacific hurricane center backs tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the northeast pacific ocean while the weather prediction center backs up tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the north atlantic ocean the first hurricane warning service was set up in the 1870s  from cuba with the work of father benito vi√±es  after his death  hurricane warning services were assumed by the united states signal corps and united states weather bureau over the next decade  first based in jamaica in 1898  and cuba in 1899  before shifting to washington  d c  in central office in washington  which evolved into the national meteorological center and weather prediction center  formally known as the hydrometeorological prediction center   assumed hurricane warning advisory responsibility at that time  this responsibility passed to regional hurricane offices in 1935,  and the concept of the atlantic hurricane season was established to keep a vigilant lookout for tropical cyclones during certain times of the year  hurricane advisories issued every six hours by the regional hurricane offices began at this jacksonville hurricane warning office moved to miami  florida in 1943.  tropical cyclone naming began for atlantic tropical cyclones using the joint army navy phonetic alphabet by in 1950,  the miami hurricane warning office began to prepare the annual hurricane season summary in the 1953  atlantic season  the united states weather bureau began naming storms which reach tropical storm intensity with human national hurricane research project  begun in the 1950s,  used aircraft to study tropical cyclones and carry out experiments on mature hurricanes through its project on july 1,  1956,  a national hurricane information center was established in miami  florida which became a warehouse for all hurricane-related  information from one united states weather bureau the miami hurricane warning office  hwo  moved from lindsey hopkins hotel to the aviation building 4  miles (6.4  km  to the northwest on july 1,  forecasts within the hurricane advisories were issued one day into the future in 1954  before being extended to two days into the future in 1961,  three days into the future in 1964,  and five days into the future in the miami hwo moved to the campus of the university of miami in and was referred to as the nhc in the miami hwo tropical cyclone reports were done regularly and took on their modern format in in 1973,  the national meteorological center duties  renamed the hydrometeorological prediction center  renamed for a second time in gained advisory responsibility for tracking and publicizing inland tropical depressions  the world meteorological organization assumed control of the atlantic hurricane naming list in in 1978,  the nhc s offices moved off the campus of the university of miami across u s  highway 1  to the ire financial male names were added into the hurricane list beginning in the 1979  the hurricane warning offices remained active past 1984,  the nhc was separated from the miami weather service forecast office  which meant the meteorologist in charge at miami was no longer in a position above the hurricane center by 1988,  the nhc gained responsibility for eastern pacific tropical cyclones as the former eastern pacific hurricane center in san francisco was in 1992,  hurricane andrew blew the wsr-57  weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of nhc s the miami state weather forecast the radar was replaced with a wsr-88d  nexrad system in april 1993  installed near metro near where hurricane andrew made landfall in 1995,  the nhc moved into a new hurricane-resistant  facility on the campus of florida international university  capable of withstanding 130  mph (210  km h  its name was changed to the tropical prediction center in after the name change to tpc  the hurricane specialists were grouped as a separate nhc unit under the tropical prediction separating themselves from the tropical analysis and forecast branch  on october 1,  2010,  the tropical prediction center was renamed the and the group formerly known as the nhc became known as the hurricane specialists unit cyclone forecasting is now done using statistical methods based on tropical cyclone climatology  as well as methods of numerical weather prediction where computers use mathematical equations of motion to determine their the world meteorological organization continues to create and maintain the annual hurricane naming lists  naming lists use a six-year  rotation  with the deadliest or most notable storm names retired from the the current acting director of the national hurricane center is edward rappaport following the retirement of richard knabb on may 15,  2017.  a permanent replacement director has not been the fiscal year of 2008,  the budget for the nhc was $6.8  a total of 66  people work for the nhc  with 12  of the staff composing their the nhc has been one of the nine national centers which compose the national centers for environmental prediction as the nhc from 1995  through 2010,  the hurricane specialists within the hurricane specialists unit  hsu  are the chief meteorologists that predict the actions of tropical storms  the specialists work rotating eight-hour  shifts from may through november  monitoring weather patterns in the atlantic and eastern pacific oceans  whenever a tropical or subtropical cyclone forms  they issue advisories every six hours until the storm is over  public advisories are issued more often when the storm expected to be of tropical storm or hurricane intensity threatens the specialists coordinate with officials in each country likely to be affected  they forecast and recommend watches and the hurricane season  the hsu routinely issues their tropical weather outlook product  which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones  if systems occur outside the defined hurricane season  the hsu issues special tropical weather backup responsibility for their northeast pacific area resides at the central pacific hurricane center and vice versa if cphc were to have communication north atlantic responsibilities are backed up by the weather prediction center routine coordination occurs at 1700  utc each day between the weather prediction center and national hurricane center to identify systems for the pressure maps three to seven days into the future within the tropics  and points for existing tropical cyclones six to seven days into the outside of the hurricane season  the specialists concentrate on public education tropical analysis and forecast branch  tafb  formerly the tropical satellite analysis and forecast unit and the tropical analysis center  is a part of the national hurricane center and was created in the tafb is responsible for high seas analyses and forecasts for tropical portions of the atlantic and pacific between the prime meridian and the 140th  meridian west poleward to the 30th  parallel north in the northeast pacific ocean and the 31st  parallel north in the northern atlantic unlike the hurricane specialists unit  hsu   tafb is staffed full-time  around the year  other responsibilities of the tafb include satellite-derived  tropical cyclone position and intensity estimates  wsr-88d  radar fixes for tropical cyclones  tropical cyclone forecast support  media support  and general operational the ocean prediction center backs up tafb in the event of a communications outage  and vice technology   science branch  tsb  develops and transitions new tools and techniques into operations for tropical weather prediction in conjunction with other government and academic entities  tsb created and continues development of the automated tropical cyclone forecasting  atcf  system  used to incorporate various data and model outputs  create and update hurdat  and to generate tropical cyclone forecasts  the tsb provides support for nhc computer and communications systems including its website  tsb maintains a number of statistical and dynamical models used in predicting both tropical cyclone behavior and associated weather conditions  the storm surge unit  which develops and maintains software to forecast the storm surge of tropical cyclones  is part of this the techniques development and applications unit  tdau  is part of chief  aerial reconnaissance coordination  all hurricanes  carcah  is a subunit of the 53d  weather reconnaissance squadron  hurricane hunters   carcah s mission is to provide a point-of-contact  and to coordinate all tropical cyclone operational reconnaissance requirements at nhc and the central pacific hurricane center for the north atlantic  caribbean  gulf of mexico  and the north pacific basin east of the international date line in accordance with the national hurricane operations plan  nhop   during the winter  carcah coordinates the atlantic and pacific winter storm requirements in support of the national winter storms operations plan  nwsop   missions are flown in advance of the high-impact  weather events forecast to affect the u s   such as heavy and at times when there is significant uncertainty within between numerical weather prediction hurricane liaison team  hlt  supports hurricane response through information exchange between the nhc  the national weather service  noaa nws   and the emergency management community  the hlt is composed of federal  state  and local emergency managers  as well as nws meteorologists and hydrologists  who maintain open lines of communication about the progress and threat level of the storm with appropriate federal  state  and local officials  the team establishes and facilitates video and or teleconferences with the nhc  fema and other federal agencies  state emergency operations centers  eocs   weather prediction center  hpc   storm prediction center  spc   and river forecast centers during significant landfalling hurricanes  the president of the united states as well as affected city mayors and state governors join the daily briefing call  which occurs at noon eastern daylight part of their annual tropical cyclone activity  the agency issues a report on every tropical cyclone in the atlantic and eastern pacific ocean basins  which are available since 1958  and 1988,  respectively  the report summarizes the synoptic history  meteorological statistics  casualties and damages  and the post-analysis  best track of a the reports were formally known as preliminary reports up until the agency maintains archives and climatological statistics on atlantic and pacific hurricane history  including annual reports on every tropical cyclone  a complete set of tropical cyclone advisories  digitized copies of related materials on older storms  season summaries published as the monthly weather review  and hurdat  which is the official tropical cyclone are dedicated to improving the accuracy of tropical cyclone forecasts from the center  the joint hurricane testbed  jht  is a joint operation between the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa  and united states weather research program to speed up the transfer of tropical cyclone-related  research into forecast operations  since 2001,  with its annual budget of between $1.0  and $1.5  million  the jht has funded 62  initiatives  with most of them being implemented operationally  the projects have had varied success  ranging from minor to significant advances in the way the nhc the hurricane forecast improvement program s  hfip  five-year  goal is to lead to a 20  percent improvement within the numerical weather prediction models provided by the national centers for environmental prediction to nhc by 2015  and a 50  percent improvement within tropical cyclone track forecasting and intensity guidance by
