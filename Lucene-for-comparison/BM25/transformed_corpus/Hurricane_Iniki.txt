 hurricane iniki -  wikipediahurricane iniki   iːˈniːkiː  ee-nee-kee;  hawaiian  ʻiniki meaning  strong and piercing wind   was the most powerful hurricane to strike the u s  state of hawaii in recorded forming on september 5,  1992,  during the strong 1990–95  el niño  iniki was one of eleven central pacific tropical cyclones during that season  it attained tropical storm status on september 8  and further intensified into a hurricane the next day  after turning north  iniki struck the island of kauaʻi on september 11  at peak intensity  it had winds of 145  miles per hour (233  km h  and reached category 4  on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale  it had recorded wind gusts of 225  as evidenced by an anemometer that was found blown into the forest during clean up  it was the first hurricane to hit the state since hurricane iwa in the 1982  season  and the first major hurricane since hurricane dot in 1959.  iniki dissipated on september 13  about halfway between hawaii and alaska iniki caused around $1.8  billion (1992  usd  of damage and six deaths  at the time  iniki was among the costliest united states hurricanes  and it remains one of the costliest hurricanes on record in the eastern pacific  the storm struck just weeks after hurricane andrew  the costliest tropical cyclone ever at the time  struck florida the central pacific hurricane center  cphc  failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches 24  hours in advance  despite the lack of early warning  only six deaths ensued  damage was greatest on kauaʻi  where the hurricane destroyed more than 1,400  houses and severely damaged more than 5,000.  though not directly in the path of the eye  oʻahu experienced moderate damage from wind and storm surge the origin of iniki is unclear  but it possibly began as a tropical wave that exited the african coast on august 18.  it moved westward across the unfavorable atlantic ocean and crossed central america into the pacific on the august 28.  the wave continued rapidly westward and remained disorganized  conditions slowly became more favorable  and  as the convection concentrated around a center  the wave was classified tropical depression eighteen-e  on september 5.  at this time  the wave was located 1700  miles (2700  km  southwest of cabo san lucas or 1550  miles (2500  km  east-southeast  of initially  the thunderstorm activity was not concentrated towards the center and thus the depression was not expected to intensify beyond minimal tropical storm the depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until september 8,  when it slowed enough to strengthen to a tropical at the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge  iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central pacific  it reached hurricane status on september 9  while 470  miles (760  km  south-southeast  of hilo  the subtropical ridge  which typically keeps hurricanes well away from the hawaiian islands  weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough  and allowed iniki to turn to the northwest  with very favorable upper-level  outflow and warm water temperatures  iniki steadily intensified  and attained major hurricane status on september 10  while south-southwest  of the island iniki turned to the north  it continued to strengthen  reaching a peak of 145  mph (235  km h  winds on september 11  while 170  miles (270  km  south-southwest  of poʻipū on the island of kauaʻi  it continued rapidly to the north-northeast,  and made landfall on south-central  kauai early on the 11th  with sustained winds of 145  mph (235  km h   making iniki a category 4  hurricane on the saffir-simpson  hurricane scale  the national weather service reported wind gusts of up to 175  mph (280  km h   the highest recorded wind speed from hurricane iniki was a 227  mph (365  km h  from the navy s makaha ridge radar station  according to the honolulu advertiser  that remarkable figure was recorded at a digital weather station whose wind gauging equipment blew off after taking the measurement during the storm  after crossing the island  iniki rapidly accelerated north-northeastward,  weakened rapidly  and was absorbed by a cold front as it lost tropical characteristics and became extratropical on september 13  about halfway between alaska and central pacific hurricane center  cphc  failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the hurricane well in advance  for several days prior to the disaster  the cphc and the news media forecast iniki to remain well south of the island chain  with the only effect being some high surf conditions  some of the standard international computer models were indicating a northward turn towards the populated hawaiian islands  but these were rejected by the cphc forecasters  as late as early september 10,  the cphc suggested that iniki would remain well to the south of the island group  it was not until a special bulletin was issued by the cphc less than 24  hours before landfall—that any warning was given to the hurricane watch was issued for kauaʻi early on september 11  and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that prior to iniki s arrival in kauaʻi  8,000  people were housed in shelters  many of whom remembered hurricane iwa 10  years because schools were canceled  traffic was light during the evacuation  and streets were clear by mid-morning.  rather than sending tourists to public shelters  two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storm s cphc issued a tropical storm warning for oʻahu on september 11  which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that though not hit by the hurricane  iniki s large wind field caused nearly 30,000  people to evacuate to 110  public shelters in oʻahu  public school buildings acted as shelters  and were for refuge only  meaning they did not provide food  cots  blankets  medications or other comfort items  roughly one-third  of oʻahu s population participated in the evacuation  though many others went to the house of a family member or friend for shelter  the execution of the evacuations went well  beginning with the vulnerable coastal area  for those in need  vans and buses gave emergency transportation  while police manned certain overused intersections  the two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the iniki was the costliest hurricane to strike the state of hawaiʻi  causing $1.8  billion in most damage was on the island of kauaʻi  where the storm destroyed thousands of homes and left a large amount of the island without power  although oʻahu also suffered significant damage  iniki also was responsible for six hurricane nearly struck the central pacific hurricane center in honolulu  had it hit there  iniki  along with hurricane andrew and typhoon omar  would have struck each of the three national weather service offices responsible for tropical cyclone warnings within a two-month  iniki made landfall on the south-central  portion of kauaʻi island  bringing its dangerous inner core to the entire upon making landfall the hurricane produced storm tides of 4.5–6  feet (1.4–1.8  m   with some portions of the coastlines having high-water  marks of up to 18  feet (5.5  m   in addition  strong waves of up to 35  feet (10.5  m  in height crashed along the southern coastline for several hours  causing a debris line of more than 800  feet (250  m  inland  because it moved quickly through the island  there were no reports of significant iniki s making landfall during daylight hours  combined with the popularity of camcorders  led many kauaʻi residents to record much of the damage as it was occurring  the footage was later used to create an hour-long  video commercial air service was iniki s high winds caused extensive damage in kauaʻi  1,421  houses were destroyed  and 63  were lost from the storm surge and wave action  a total of 5,152  homes were severely damaged  while 7,178  received minor on the south coast  hotels and condominiums received severe damage as well  a few were restored quickly  though some took several years to be rebuilt  one hotel—the coco palms resort famous for elvis presley s blue hawaii—never reopened after the destroyed housing across the island left more than 7,000  people homeless after the storm s high winds also downed 26.5%  of the island s transmission poles  37%  of its distribution poles  and 35%  of its 800  mile (1300  km  distribution wire system  the entire island lacked electricity and television service for an extended period of electric companies restored only 20%  of the island s power service within four weeks of iniki  while other areas were without power for up to three months  also affected by the storm was the agricultural though much of the sugar cane was already what was left was severely damaged  the winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut of iniki s damage occurred in kauaʻi  on the island  one person died when struck by debris  while another lost her life when a portion of her house fell on her  offshore  two japanese nationals died when their boat capsized  the reduced death toll was likely due to well-executed  warnings and preparation  more than 100  injuries can be attributed to iniki  though most occurred in the aftermath of the those on kauaʻi was filmmaker steven spielberg  who was preparing for the final day of on-location  shooting of the film jurassic park  he and the 130  of his cast and crew remained safely in a hotel during iniki s according to spielberg   every single structure was in shambles  roofs and walls were torn away  telephone poles and trees were down as far as the eye could see   spielberg included footage of iniki battering the kaua i coastal walls as part of the completed film  where a tropical storm makes up a pivotal part of the plot  members of the film s crew helped to clear some of the debris off of nearby passing by oʻahu  iniki produced tides of 1.7–3  feet (0.5–0.9  m  above prolonged periods of high waves severely eroded and damaged the southwestern coast of oʻahu  with the areas most affected being barbers point through the waiʻanae coastline experienced the most damage  with waves and storm surge flooding the second floor of beachside in all  hurricane iniki caused several million dollars in property and two deaths on on the island of hawai‘i was minor  seas of 10  ft (3.0  m  were reported  along with 40  mph (65  km h  in honokōhau harbor  three or four sailboats were tossed onto the rocks and one trimaran at another harbor was sunk  a beach near napoʻopoʻo on kealakekua bay lost some sand and to this day has never been the after the storm  many were relieved to have survived the worst of the category 4  hurricane  their complacency turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of information  as every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days  because iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island  communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers  though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed  many kauaʻi citizens insisted on paying  in addition  entertainers from all of hawaiʻi  including graham nash  who owns a home on the north shore of kauaʻi  and the honolulu symphony  provided free concerts to the film jurassic park was being filmed at the time  the sets used for the deleted scene where mr arnold goes to the shed to turn the power on were destroyed  the cast and crew took shelter in a hotel  looting occurred in the aftermath of iniki  though it was very minor  a group of army corps of engineers  who experienced the looting of hurricane andrew just weeks before  were surprised at the overall calmness and lack of violence on the island  although electrical power was restored to most of the island approximately six weeks following the hurricane  students returned to kauaʻi public schools two weeks after the disaster  kauaʻi citizens remained hopeful for monetary aid from the government or insurance companies  though after six months they felt annoyed with the lack of the military effectively provided aid for their immediate needs  though  and help arrived before local officials requested radio proved to be extremely helpful during the three weeks after the storm  with volunteers coming from the neighboring islands as well as from around the pacific to assist in the recovery  there was support of local government communications in lihue in the first week of recovery as well as a hastily organized effort by local operators to assist with the american red cross and their efforts to provide shelters and disaster relief centers across the months after the storm  many insurance companies left hawaiʻi  to combat this  state governor john d  waihee iii enacted the hurricane relief fund in 1993  to help unprotected hawaiʻi residents  the fund was never needed for another hawaiʻi hurricane  and it was stopped in 2000  when insurance companies returned to the is thought that hurricane iniki blew apart many chicken coops  some possibly used to house fighting chickens  this caused a dramatic increase in the numbers of wild chickens roaming name iniki was retired due to this storm  and was replaced with iolana within the central north pacific tropical storm less than three days after iniki struck  hurricane orlene struck the big island as a depression
