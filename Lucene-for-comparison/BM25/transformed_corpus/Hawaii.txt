until 1893  when the monarchy was overthrown by resident american and european capitalists and landholders  hawaii was an independent republic from 1894  until august 12,  1898,  when it officially became a territory of the united states  hawaii was admitted as a u s  state on august 21,  on archaeological evidence  the earliest habitation of the hawaiian islands dates to around 300  ce  probably by polynesian settlers from the marquesas islands  a second wave of migration from raiatea and bora bora took place in the 11th  century  the date of the human discovery and habitation of the hawaiian islands is the subject of academic some archaeologists and historians think it was a later wave of immigrants from tahiti around 1000  ce who introduced a new line of high chiefs  the kapu system  the practice of human sacrifice  and the building of needed  this later immigration is detailed in hawaiian mythology  moʻolelo  about paʻao  other authors say there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a later influx of tahitian settlers and that paʻao must be regarded as a needed the history of the islands is marked by a slow  steady growth in population and the size of the chiefdoms  which grew to encompass whole islands  local chiefs  called aliʻi  ruled their settlements  and launched wars to extend their influence and defend their communities from predatory rivals  ancient hawaii was a caste-based  society  much like that of hindus in is possible that spanish explorers arrived in the hawaiian islands in the 16th  century—200  years before captain james cook s first documented visit in 1778.  ruy lópez de villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left acapulco in 1542  bound for the philippines with a spanish sailor named juan gaetano aboard as pilot  depending on the interpretation  gaetano s reports describe an encounter with either hawaiʻi or the marshall source needed  if de villalobos  crew spotted hawaiʻi  gaetano would be considered the first european to see the islands  some scholars have dismissed these claims due to a lack of archives contain a chart that depicts islands at the same latitude as hawaiʻi but with a longitude ten degrees east of the islands  in this manuscript  the island of maui is named la desgraciada  the unfortunate island   and what appears to be hawaiʻi island is named la mesa  the table   islands resembling kahoolawe  lanai  and molokai are named los monjes  the for two-and-a-half  centuries  spanish galleons crossed the pacific from mexico along a route that passed south of hawaiʻi on their way to manila  the exact route was kept secret to protect the spanish trade monopoly against competing powers the 1778  arrival of british explorer james cook was the first documented contact by a european explorer with hawaii  cook named the archipelago as the sandwich islands in honor of his sponsor john montagu  4th  earl of sandwich  cook published the islands  location and rendered the native name as owyhee  this spelling lives on in owyhee county  idaho  it was named after three native hawaiian members of a trapping party who went missing in that area  the owyhee mountains were also named for visited the hawaiian islands twice  as he prepared for departure after his second visit in 1779,  a quarrel ensued as cook took temple idols and fencing as and a minor chief and his men took a ship s boat  cook abducted the king of hawaiʻi island  kalaniʻōpuʻu  and held him for ransom aboard his ship in order to gain return of cook s boat  this tactic had worked in tahiti and other instead  kalaniʻōpuʻu s supporters fought back  killing cook and four marines as cook s party retreated along the beach to their ship  they departed without the ship s boat after cook s visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages  the hawaiian islands attracted many european visitors  explorers  traders  and eventually whalers  who found the islands to be a convenient harbor and source of supplies  early british influence can be seen in the design of the flag of hawaiʻi  which bears the union jack in the top-left  corner  these visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated  islands  causing the hawaiian population to drop native hawaiians had no resistance to eurasian diseases  such as influenza  smallpox and measles  by 1820,  disease  famine and wars between the chiefs killed more than half of the native hawaiian during the 1850s,  measles killed a fifth of hawaii s records indicated the earliest chinese immigrants to hawaii originated from guangdong province  a few sailors arrived in 1778  with captain cook s journey and more arrived in 1789  with an american trader  who settled in hawaii in the late 18th  century  it appears that leprosy was introduced by chinese workers by 1830;  as with the other new infectious diseases  it proved damaging to the needed during the 1780s  and 1790s,  chiefs often fought for power  after a series of battles that ended in 1795,  all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler  who became known as king kamehameha the great  he established the house of kamehameha  a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until kamehameha ii inherited the throne in 1819,  american protestant missionaries to hawaii converted many hawaiians to christianity  they used their influence to end many traditional practices of the during the reign of king kamehameha iii  hawai i turned into a christian monarchy with the signing of the 1840  hiram bingham i  a prominent protestant missionary  was a trusted adviser to the monarchy during this period  other missionaries and their descendants became active in commercial and political affairs  leading to conflicts between the monarchy and its restive american catholic and mormon missionaries were also active in the kingdom  but they converted a minority of the native hawaiian missionaries from each major group administered to the leper colony at kalaupapa on molokaʻi  which was established in 1866  and operated well into the 20th  century  the best known were father damien and mother marianne cope  both of whom were canonized in the early 21st  century as roman catholic saints the death of the bachelor king kamehameha v—who did not name an heir—resulted in the popular election of lunalilo over kalākaua  lunalilo died the next year  also without naming an heir  in 1874,  the election was contested within the legislature between kalākaua and emma  queen consort of kamehameha iv  after riots broke out  the united states and britain landed troops on the islands to restore order  king kalākaua was chosen as monarch by the legislative assembly by a vote of 39  to 6  on february 12,  1887,  kalākaua was forced to sign the 1887  constitution of the kingdom of hawaii  drafted by white businessmen and lawyers  the document stripped the king of much of his authority  it established a property qualification for voting that effectively disenfranchised most hawaiians and immigrant laborers and favored the wealthier  white elite  resident whites were allowed to vote but resident asians were not  as the 1887  constitution was signed under threat of violence  it is known as the bayonet constitution  king kalākaua  reduced to a figurehead  reigned until his death in 1891.  his sister  queen liliʻuokalani  succeeded him  she was the last monarch of 1893,  queen liliʻuokalani announced plans for a new constitution to proclaim herself an absolute monarch  on january 14,  1893,  a group of mostly euro-american  business leaders and residents formed the committee of safety to stage a coup d état against the kingdom and seek annexation by the united states  united states government minister john l  stevens  responding to a request from the committee of safety  summoned a company of u s  marines  the queen s soldiers did not resist  according to historian william russ  the monarchy was unable to protect january 1893,  queen liliʻuokalani was overthrown and replaced by a provisional government composed of members of the committee of safety  lawyer sanford b  dole  a citizen of hawaii  became president of the republic when the provisional government of hawaii ended on july 4,  1894.  controversy ensued in the following years as the queen tried to regain her throne  the administration of president grover cleveland commissioned the blount report  which concluded that the removal of liliʻuokalani had been illegal  the u s  government first demanded that queen liliʻuokalani be reinstated  but the provisional government refused congress conducted an independent investigation  and on february 26,  1894,  submitted the morgan report  which found all parties  including minister stevens—with the exception of the queen— not guilty  and not responsible for the partisans on both sides of the debate questioned the accuracy and impartiality of both the blount and morgan reports over the events of 1993,  the us congress passed a joint apology resolution regarding the overthrow  it was signed by president bill clinton  the resolution did not apologize and did not say the overthrow was illegal  it  acknowledges that the overthrow of the kingdom of hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the united states and further acknowledges that the native hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the united states their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands  either through the kingdom of hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum   william mckinley won the 1896  u s  presidential election  advocates pressed to annex the republic of hawaii  the previous president  grover cleveland  was a friend of queen liliʻuokalani  mckinley was open to persuasion by u s  expansionists and by annexationists from hawaiʻi  he met with three annexationists  lorrin a  thurston  francis march hatch and william ansel kinney  after negotiations in june 1897,  secretary of state john sherman agreed to a treaty of annexation with these representatives of the republic of the u s  senate never ratified the treaty  despite the opposition of most native the newlands resolution was used to annex the republic to the u s   it became the territory of hawaii  the newlands resolution was passed by the house on june 15,  1898,  by 209  votes in favor to 91  against  and by the senate on july 6,  1898,  by a vote of 42  to 1900,  hawaii was granted self-governance  and retained ʻiolani palace as the territorial capitol building  despite several attempts to become a state  hawaii remained a territory for sixty years  plantation owners and capitalists  who maintained control through financial institutions such as the big five  found territorial status convenient because they remained able to import cheap  foreign labor  such immigration and labor practices were prohibited in many rican immigration to hawaii began in 1899  when puerto rico s sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes  causing a worldwide shortage of sugar and a huge demand for sugar from hawaii  hawaiian sugarcane plantation owners began to recruit experienced  unemployed laborers in puerto rico  two waves of korean immigration to hawaii occurred in the 20th  century  the first wave arrived between 1903  and 1924;  the second wave began in 1965  after president lyndon b  johnson signed the immigration and nationality act of 1965  which removed racial and national barriers and resulted in significantly altering the demographic mix in the was the target of a surprise attack on pearl harbor by imperial japan on december 7,  1941.  the attack on pearl harbor and other military and naval installations  carried out by aircraft and by midget submarines  brought the united states into world war ii in the 1950s,  the power of the plantation owners was broken by the descendants of immigrant laborers  who were born in hawaii and were u s  citizens  they voted against the hawaii republican party  strongly supported by plantation owners  the new majority voted for the democratic party of hawaii  which dominated territorial and state politics for more than 40  years  eager to gain full representation in congress and the electoral college  residents actively campaigned for statehood  in washington there was talk that hawaii would be a republican party stronghold so it was matched with the admission of alaska  seen as a democratic party stronghold  these predictions turned out to be inaccurate  today  hawaii votes democratic predominately  and alaska votes march 1959,  congress passed the hawaii admission act  which u s  president dwight d  eisenhower signed into the act excluded palmyra atoll from statehood  it had been part of the kingdom and territory of hawaii  on june 27,  1959,  a referendum asked residents of hawaii to vote on the statehood bill  94.3%  voted in favor of statehood and 5.7%  opposed the referendum asked voters to choose between accepting the act and remaining a u s  territory  the united nations  special committee on decolonization later removed hawaii from its list of non-self-governing  territories after attaining statehood  hawaii quickly modernized through construction and a rapidly growing tourism economy  later  state programs promoted hawaiian the hawaii state constitutional convention of 1978  created institutions such as the office of hawaiian affairs to promote indigenous language and needed after europeans and mainland americans first arrived during the kingdom of hawaii period  the overall population of hawaii  until that time composed solely of indigenous hawaiians  fell dramatically  the indigenous hawaiian population succumbed to foreign diseases  declining from 300,000  in the 1770s,  to 60,000  in the 1850s,  to 24,000  in 1920.  the population of hawaii began to finally increase after an influx of primarily asian settlers that arrived as migrant laborers at the end of the 19th  unmixed indigenous hawaiian population has still not restored itself to its 300,000  pre-contact  level  as of 2010,  only 156,000  persons declared themselves to be of native hawaiian only ancestry  just over half of the pre-contact  level native hawaiian population  although an additional 371,000  persons declared themselves to possess

evolved into the hawaiian kimura and wilson say  agree that hawaiian is closely related to eastern polynesian  with a particularly strong link in the southern marquesas  and a secondary link in tahiti  which may be explained by voyaging between the hawaiian and society before the arrival of captain james cook  the hawaiian language had no written form  that form was developed mainly by american protestant missionaries between 1820  and 1826.  they assigned to the hawaiian phonemes letters from the latin needed interest in hawaiian increased significantly in the late 20th  century  with the

during the 19th  century  the increase in immigration—mainly from china  japan  portugal—especially from the azores and madeira  and spain—catalyzed the development of a hybrid variant of english

capita income for hawaii residents in 2014  was hawaiian exports include food and clothing  these industries play a small role in the hawaiian economy  due to the shipping distance to viable markets

state s tax burden too high  which it says contributes to higher prices and the perception of an unfriendly business senator sam slom says state taxes are comparatively higher than other states because the state government handles education  health care  and social services that are usually handled at a county or municipal level in most other cost of living in hawaii  specifically honolulu  is high compared to that of most major u s  cities  although it is 6.7%  lower than in new york city and 3.6%  lower than in san these numbers may not take into account some costs  such as increased travel costs for flights  additional shipping fees  and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the contiguous u s  while some online stores offer free shipping on

electricity  mostly from fossil-fuel  power stations  average electricity prices in october 2014  (36.41  cents per kilowatt-hour)  were nearly three times the national average (12.58  cents per

silicon valley area of california very high cost of living is the result of several interwoven factors of the global economy in addition to domestic u s  government trade policy  like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year  such as areas of california  arizona and florida  hawaii s residents can be considered to be subject to a  sunshine tax   this situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs  a problem which many island states and territories suffer from as well  the situation is compounded even further by what could possibly be the single largest contributor to the high costs of living in hawaii  a u s  trade law known as the jones act  or the merchant marine act of 1920.  this trade regulation prohibits any foreign-flagged  ships from carrying cargo between two american ports—a practice known as cabotage  most consumer goods in the united states are manufactured by outsourced labor in east asia  then transported by container ships to ports on the u s  mainland  and hawaii also receives the same goods  being located in the central pacific ocean  right between major pacific shipping lanes  it would be very economical to unload hawaiian-bound  goods in honolulu  before continuing on to the mainland  however  this would effectively make the second leg of the voyage between hawaii and the mainland a domestic route between two american ports  because most large cargo ships operate under foreign  flags of convenience  such as liberia  vanuatu or papua new guinea  allowing them to avoid the more stringent  and thus more costly  regulations of developed nations  ports  the domestic leg of the voyage would be disallowed by the jones act  instead  those cargo ships must proceed directly to the west coast  where distributors break bulk and transport the hawaiian-bound,  asian-manufactured  goods back across the ocean by u.s.-flagged  ships and increasing the length of the voyage by more than 50%.  this highly inefficient system of shipping hawaii s consumer cargo comes at a very hefty price for the average hawaiian citizen  and makes the cost of living in hawaii much  much higher than it would otherwise consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the jones act  this law makes hawaii less competitive than west coast ports as a shopping destination for tourists from countries with much higher taxes like japan  even though prices for asian-manufactured  goods should be cheaper because hawaii is much closer than mainland states to aboriginal culture of hawaii is polynesian  hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast polynesian triangle of the south and central pacific ocean  while traditional hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern hawaiian society  there are re-enactments  of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands  some of
