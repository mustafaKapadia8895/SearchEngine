 atlas -  wikipediaan atlas is a collection of maps  it is typically a bundle of maps of earth or a region of earth  but there are atlases of the other planets  and their satellites  in the solar system  furthermore  atlases of anatomy exist  mapping out organs of the human body or other atlases have traditionally been bound into book form  but today many atlases are in multimedia formats  in addition to presenting geographic features and political boundaries  many atlases often feature geopolitical  social  religious and economic statistics  they also have information about the map and places in it the use of the word atlas in a geographical context dates from 1595  when the geographer gerardus mercator published atlas sive cosmographicae meditationes de fabrica mundi et fabricati figura   atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe  and the universe as created   this title provides mercator s definition of the word as a description of the creation and form of the whole universe  not simply as a collection of maps  the volume that was published posthumously one year after his death is a wide-ranging  text but  as the editions evolved  it became simply a collection of maps and it is in that sense that the word was used from the middle of the seventeenth century  the neologism coined by mercator was a mark of his respect for king atlas of mauretania whom he considered to be the first great geographer and it is that king who is portrayed on the frontispiece of the 1595  edition  however  by the time of the 1636  edition  the frontispiece image had become the titan atlas supporting the first work that contained systematically arranged woodcut maps of uniform size  intended to be published in a book  thus representing the first modern atlas  was de summa totius orbis (1524â€“26)  by the 16th-century  italian cartographer pietro coppo  nonetheless  this distinction is conventionally awarded to the flemish cartographer abraham ortelius who in 1570  published the collection of maps theatrum orbis terrarum a travel atlas is made for easy use during travel  and often has spiral bindings so it may be folded flat  for example geographers  a-z  map company famous a-z  atlases   it has maps at a large zoom so the maps can be reviewed easily  a travel atlas may also be referred to as a road desk atlas is made similar to a reference book  it may be in hardback or paperback form with the coming of the global market  publishers in different countries can reprint maps from places made elsewhere  this means that the place names on the maps often use the designations or abbreviations of the language of the country in which the feature is located  to serve the widest market  for example  islands near russia have the abbreviation  o   for  ostrov   not  i   for  island   this practice differs from what is standard for any given language  and it reaches its extremity concerning transliterations from other languages  in particular  german mapmakers use the transliterations from cyrillic developed by the czechs  which are hardly used in english-speaking  countries some cartographically or commercially important atlases include the following
