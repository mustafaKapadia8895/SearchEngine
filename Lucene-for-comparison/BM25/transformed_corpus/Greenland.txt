 greenland -  wikipediagreenland   ˈɡriːnlənd   greenlandic  kalaallit nunaat  pronounced nunaːt   danish  grønland  pronounced is an autonomous constituent country within the kingdom of denmark between the arctic and atlantic oceans  east of the canadian arctic archipelago  though physiographically a part of the continent of north america  greenland has been politically and culturally associated with europe  specifically norway and denmark  the colonial powers  as well as the nearby island of iceland  for more than a the majority of its residents are inuit  whose ancestors began migrating from the canadian mainland in the 13th  century  gradually settling across the island greenland is the world s largest island  australia  although larger  is generally considered to be a continental landmass rather than an three-quarters  of greenland is covered by the only permanent ice sheet outside antarctica  with a population of about (2013),  it is the least densely populated country in the about a third of the population live in nuuk  the capital and largest city  the arctic umiaq line ferry acts as a lifeline for western greenland  connecting the various cities and settlements greenland has been inhabited off and on for at least the last 4,500  years by arctic peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now norsemen settled the uninhabited southern part of greenland beginning in the 10th  century  and inuit peoples arrived in the 13th  century  the norse colonies disappeared in the late 15th  century  soon after their demise  beginning in 1499,  the portuguese briefly explored and claimed the island  naming it terra do lavrador  later applied to labrador in in the early 18th  century  scandinavian explorers reached greenland again  to strengthen trading and power  denmark-norway  affirmed sovereignty over the island denmark–norway claimed greenland for centuries  greenland was settled by vikings  of norwegian origin  more than a thousand years ago  who had previously settled iceland to escape persecution from the king of norway and his central government  vikings set sail from greenland and iceland  with leif erikson becoming the first known european to reach north america nearly 500  years before columbus reached the caribbean islands  they attempted to colonize land  though under continuous influence of norway and norwegians  greenland was not formally under the norwegian crown until 1262.  the kingdom of norway was extensive and a military power until the mid-14th  century  norway was dramatically hit with a larger death toll than denmark by the black death  forcing norway to accept a union in which the central government  university and other fundamental institutions were located in copenhagen  thus  the two kingdoms  resources were directed at creating copenhagen  norway became the weaker part and lost sovereignty over greenland in 1814  when the union was dissolved  greenland became a danish colony in 1814,  and was made a part of the danish realm in 1953  under the constitution of denmark in 1973,  greenland joined the european economic community with denmark  however  in a referendum in 1982,  a majority of the population voted for greenland to withdraw from the eec which was effected in 1985.  greenland contains the world s largest and most northernly national park  northeast greenland national park  kalaallit nunaanni nuna eqqissisimatitaq   established in 1974  and expanded to its present size in 1988,  it protects 972,001  square kilometres (375,292  sq mi  of the interior and northeastern coast of greenland and is bigger than all but twenty-nine  countries in the world  greenland is divided into four municipalities – sermersooq  kujalleq  qaasuitsup  and qeqqata in 1979,  denmark had granted home rule to greenland  and in 2008,  greenlanders voted in favour of the self-government  act  which transferred more power from the danish government to the local greenlandic government  under the new structure  in effect since 21  june greenland can gradually assume responsibility for policing  judicial system  company law  accounting  and auditing  mineral resource activities  aviation  law of legal capacity  family law and succession law  aliens and border controls  the working environment  and financial regulation and supervision  while the danish government retains control of foreign affairs and defence  it also retains control of monetary policy  providing an initial annual subsidy of dkk 3.4  billion  which is planned to diminish gradually over time  greenland expects to grow its economy based on increased income from the extraction of natural resources  the capital  nuuk  held the 2016  arctic winter games  at 70%,  greenland has one of the highest shares of renewable energy in the world  mostly coming from citation needed the early viking settlers named the island as greenland  in the icelandic sagas  the norwegian-born  icelander erik the red was said to be exiled from iceland for manslaughter  along with his extended family and his thralls  he set out in ships to explore an icy land known to lie to the northwest  after finding a habitable area and settling there  he named it grœnland  translated as  greenland    supposedly in the hope that the pleasant name would attract name of the country in greenlandic is kalaallit nunaat   land of the the kalaallit are the indigenous greenlandic inuit people who inhabit the country s western region in prehistoric times  greenland was home to several successive paleo-eskimo  cultures known today primarily through archaeological finds  the earliest entry of the paleo-eskimo  into greenland is thought to have occurred about 2500  bc  from around 2500  bc to 800  bc  southern and western greenland were inhabited by the saqqaq culture  most finds of saqqaq-period  archaeological remains have been around disko bay  including the site of saqqaq  after which the culture is 2400  bc to 1300  bc  the independence i culture existed in northern greenland  it was a part of the arctic small tool towns  including deltaterrasserne  started to appear around 800  bc  the saqqaq culture disappeared and the early dorset culture emerged in western greenland and the independence ii culture in northern the dorset culture was the first culture to extend throughout the greenlandic coastal areas  both on the west and east coasts  it lasted until the total onset of the thule culture in 1500  ad  the dorset culture population lived primarily from hunting of whales and 986,  greenland s west coast was settled by icelanders and norwegians  through a contingent of 14  boats led by erik the red  they formed three settlements—known as the eastern settlement  the western settlement and the middle settlement—on fjords near the southwestern-most  tip of the they shared the island with the late dorset culture inhabitants who occupied the northern and western parts  and later with the thule culture that entered from the north  norse greenlanders submitted to norwegian rule in the 13th  century under the norwegian empire  later the kingdom of norway entered into a personal union with denmark in 1380,  and from 1397  was a part of the kalmar norse settlements  such as brattahlíð  thrived for centuries but disappeared sometime in the 15th  century  perhaps at the onset of the little ice apart from some runic inscriptions  no contemporary records or historiography survives from the norse settlements  medieval norwegian sagas and historical works mention greenland s economy as well as the bishops of gardar and the collection of tithes  a chapter in the konungs skuggsjá  the king s mirror  describes norse greenland s exports and imports as well as grain cultivation icelandic saga accounts of life in greenland were composed in the 13th  century and later  and do not constitute primary sources for the history of early norse modern understanding therefore mostly depends on the physical data from archeological sites  interpretation of ice core and clam shell data suggests that between 800  and 1300,  the regions around the fjords of southern greenland experienced a relatively mild climate several degrees celsius higher than usual in the north with trees and herbaceous plants growing  and livestock being farmed  barley was grown as a crop up to the 70th  what is verifiable is that the ice cores indicate greenland has had dramatic temperature shifts many times over the past 100,000  similarly the icelandic book of settlements records famines during the winters  in which  the old and helpless were killed and thrown over icelandic settlements vanished during the 14th  and early 15th  the demise of the western settlement coincides with a decrease in summer and winter temperatures  a study of north atlantic seasonal temperature variability during the little ice age showed a significant decrease in maximum summer temperatures beginning in the late 13th  century to early 14th  century—as much as 6  to 8  °c (11  to 14  °f  lower than modern summer the study also found that the lowest winter temperatures of the last 2000  years occurred in the late 14th  century and early 15th  century  the eastern settlement was likely abandoned in the early to mid-15th  century  during this cold period theories drawn from archeological excavations at herjolfsnes in the 1920s,  suggest that the condition of human bones from this period indicates that the norse population was malnourished  maybe due to soil erosion resulting from the norsemen s destruction of natural vegetation in the course of farming  turf-cutting,  and wood-cutting.  malnutrition may also have resulted from widespread deaths due to pandemic the decline in temperatures during the little ice age  and armed conflicts with the skrælings  norse word for inuit   in 1379,  the inuit attacked the eastern settlement  killed 18  men and captured two boys and a recent archeological studies somewhat challenge the general assumption that the norse colonisation had a dramatic negative environmental effect on the vegetation  data support traces of a possible norse soil amendment more recent evidence suggests that the norse  who never numbered more than about 2,500,  gradually abandoned the greenland settlements over the 1400s  as walrus the most valuable export from greenland  decreased in price due to competition with other sources of higher-quality  ivory  and that there was actually little evidence of starvation or theories about the disappearance of the norse settlement have been proposed the thule people are the ancestors of the current greenlandic population  no genes from the paleo-eskimos  have been found in the present population of the thule culture migrated eastward from what is now known as alaska around 1000,  reaching greenland around 1300.  the thule culture was the first to introduce to greenland such technological innovations as dog sleds and toggling harpoons in 1500,  king manuel i of portugal sent gaspar corte-real  to greenland in search of a northwest passage to asia which  according to the treaty of tordesillas  was part of portugal s sphere of influence  in 1501,  corte-real  returned with his brother  miguel corte-real.  finding the sea frozen  they headed south and arrived in labrador and newfoundland  upon the brothers  return to portugal  the cartographic information supplied by corte-real  was incorporated into a new map of the world which was presented to ercole i d este  duke of ferrara  by alberto cantino in 1502.  the cantino planisphere  made in lisbon  accurately depicts the southern coastline of 1605–1607,  king christian iv of denmark sent a series of expeditions to greenland and arctic waterways to locate the lost eastern norse settlement and assert danish sovereignty over greenland  the expeditions were mostly unsuccessful  partly due to leaders who lacked experience with the difficult arctic ice and weather conditions  and partly because the expedition leaders were given instructions to search for the eastern settlement on the east coast of greenland just north of cape farewell  which is almost inaccessible due to southward drifting ice  the pilot on all three trips was english explorer james hall after the norse settlements died off  the area came under the de facto control of various inuit groups  but the danish government never forgot or relinquished the claims to greenland that it had inherited from the norse  when it re-established  contact with greenland in the early 18th  century  denmark asserted its sovereignty over the island  in 1721,  a joint mercantile and clerical expedition led by danish-norwegian  missionary hans egede was sent to greenland  not knowing whether a norse civilization remained there  this expedition is part of the dano-norwegian  colonization of the americas  after 15  years in greenland  hans egede left his son paul egede in charge of the mission there and returned to denmark  where he established a greenland seminary  this new colony was centred at godthåb   good hope   on the southwest coast  gradually  greenland was opened up to danish merchants  and closed to those from other countries when the union between the crowns of denmark and norway was dissolved in 1814,  the treaty of kiel severed norway s former colonies and left them under the control of the danish monarch  norway occupied then-uninhabited  eastern greenland as erik the red s land in july 1931,  claiming that it constituted terra nullius  norway and denmark agreed to submit the matter in 1933  to the permanent court of international justice  which decided against connection to denmark was severed on 9  april 1940,  early in world war ii  after denmark was occupied by nazi germany  on 8  april 1941,  the united states occupied greenland to defend it against a possible invasion by the united states occupation of greenland continued until 1945.  greenland was able to buy goods from the united states and canada by selling cryolite from the mine at ivittuut  the major air bases were bluie west-1  at narsarsuaq and bluie west-8  at søndre strømfjord  kangerlussuaq   both of which are still used as greenland s major international airports  bluie was the military code name for greenland during this war  the system of government changed  governor eske brun ruled the island under a law of 1925  that allowed governors to take control under extreme circumstances  governor aksel svane was transferred to the united states to lead the commission to supply greenland  the danish sirius patrol guarded the northeastern shores of greenland in 1942  using dogsleds  they detected several german weather stations and alerted american troops  who destroyed the facilities  after the collapse of the third reich  albert speer briefly considered escaping in a small aeroplane to hide out in greenland  but changed his mind and decided to surrender to the united states armed had been a protected and very isolated society until 1940.  the danish government had maintained a strict monopoly of greenlandic trade  allowing only small scale troaking with scottish whalers  in wartime greenland developed a sense of self-reliance  through self-government  and independent communication with the outside world  despite this change  in 1946  a commission including the highest greenlandic council  the landsrådene  recommended patience and no radical reform of the system  two years later  the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established  a final report (g-50)  was presented in 1950:  greenland was to be a modern welfare state with denmark as sponsor and example  in 1953  greenland was made an equal part of the danish kingdom  home rule was granted in 1979.following  world war ii  the united states developed a geopolitical interest in greenland  and in 1946  the united states offered to buy the island from denmark for $100,000,000.  denmark refused to sell in the 21st  century  the united states  according to wikileaks  remains highly interested in investing in the resource base of greenland and in tapping hydrocarbons off the greenlandic 1950  denmark agreed to allow the us to reestablish thule air base in greenland  it was greatly expanded between 1951  and 1953  as part of a unified nato cold war defense strategy  the local population of three nearby villages was moved more than 100  kilometres (62  mi  away in the winter  the united states tried to construct a subterranean network of secret nuclear missile launch sites in the greenlandic ice cap  named project iceworm  it managed this project from camp century from 1960  to 1966  before abandoning it as unworkable  the danish government did not become aware of the program s mission until 1997,  when they discovered it while looking for records related to the crash of a nuclear-equipped  b-52  bomber at thule in 1968.with  the 1953  danish constitution  greenland s colonial status ended as the island was incorporated into the danish realm as an amt  county   danish citizenship was extended to greenlanders  danish policies toward greenland consisted of a strategy of cultural assimilation—or de-greenlandification.  during this period  the danish government promoted the exclusive use of the danish language in official matters  and required greenlanders to go to denmark for their post-secondary  education  many greenlandic children grew up in boarding schools in southern denmark  and a number lost their cultural ties to greenland  while the policies  succeeded  in the sense of shifting greenlanders from being primarily subsistence hunters into being urbanized wage earners  the greenlandic elite began to reassert a greenlandic cultural identity  a movement developed in favour of independence  reaching its peak in the as a consequence of political complications in relation to denmark s entry into the european common market in 1972,  denmark began to seek a different status for greenland  resulting in the home rule act of 1979.this  gave greenland limited autonomy with its own legislature taking control of some internal policies  while the parliament of denmark maintained full control of external policies  security  and natural resources  the law came into effect on 1  may 1979.  the queen of denmark  margrethe ii  remains greenland s head of state  in 1985,  greenland left the european economic community  eec  upon achieving self-rule,  as it did not agree with the eec s commercial fishing regulations and an eec ban on seal skin greenland voters approved a referendum on greater autonomy on 25  november 21  june 2009,  greenland gained self-rule  with provisions for assuming responsibility for self-government  of judicial affairs  policing  and natural resources  also  greenlanders were recognized as a separate people under international denmark maintains control of foreign affairs and defence matters  denmark upholds the annual block grant of 3.2  billion danish kroner  but as greenland begins to collect revenues of its natural resources  the grant will gradually be diminished  this is generally considered to be a step toward eventual full independence from greenlandic was declared the sole official language of greenland at the historic is the world s largest non-continental  and the third largest country in north it lies between latitudes 59°  and 83°n,  and longitudes 11°  and 74°w.

world  as well as the fourth largest country subdivision in the world  after sakha republic in russia  australia s state of western australia  and russia s krasnoyarsk krai  and the largest in north america the average daily temperature of nuuk  greenland varies over the seasons from −8  to 7  °c (18  to 45  °f   the total area of greenland is 2,166,086  km2  (836,330  sq mi   including other offshore minor islands   of which the greenland ice sheet covers 1,755,637  km2  (677,855  sq mi  (81%)  and has a volume of approximately 2,850,000  km3  (680,000  cu the highest point on greenland

brønlund fjord was  until 1950,  the northernmost permanent outpost in the world the extreme north of greenland  peary land  is not covered by an ice sheet  because the air there is too dry to produce snow  which is essential in the production and maintenance of an ice sheet  if the greenland ice sheet were to melt away completely  the world s sea level would rise by more than 7  m (23  1989  and 1993,  us and european climate researchers drilled into the summit of greenland s ice sheet  obtaining a pair of 3  km (1.9  mi  long ice cores  analysis of the layering and chemical composition of the cores has provided a revolutionary new record of climate change in the northern hemisphere going back about 100,000  years and illustrated that the world s weather and temperature have often shifted rapidly from one seemingly stable state to another  with worldwide the glaciers of greenland are also contributing to a rise in the global sea level at a faster rate than was previously between 1991  and 2004,  monitoring of the weather at one location  swiss camp  showed that the average winter temperature had risen almost 6  °c (11  other research has shown that higher snowfalls

than is generally believed  dna of trees  plants  spiders and insects including butterflies from beneath the southern greenland glacier was estimated to date to 450,000  to 900,000  years ago  according to the remnants retrieved from this long-vanished  boreal forest  that view contrasts sharply with the prevailing one that a lush forest of this kind could not have existed in greenland any later than 2.4  million years ago  these dna samples suggest that the temperature probably reached 10  °c (50  °f  in the summer and −17  °c (1.4  °f  in the winter  they also indicate that during the last interglacial period  130,000–116,000  years ago  when local temperatures were on average 5  °c (9  °f  higher than now  the glaciers on greenland did not completely melt away in 2003,  a small island  35  by 15  metres (115  by 49  feet  in length and width  was discovered by arctic explorer dennis schmitt and his team at the coordinates of 83-42.  whether this island is permanent is not confirmed as of yet  if it is  it is the northernmost permanent known land on earth in 2007  the existence of a new island was announced  named  uunartoq qeqertaq   english  warming island   this island has always been present off the coast of greenland  but was covered by a glacier  this glacier was discovered in 2002  to be shrinking rapidly  and by 2007  had completely melted away  leaving
