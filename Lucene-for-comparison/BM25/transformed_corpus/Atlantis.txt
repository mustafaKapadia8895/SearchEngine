 atlantis -  wikipediaatlantis  ancient greek  ἀτλαντὶς νῆσος   island of atlas   is a fictional island mentioned within an allegory on the hubris of nations in plato s works timaeus and critias  where it represents the antagonist naval power that besieges  ancient athens   the pseudo-historic  embodiment of plato s ideal state  see the republic   in the story  athens repels the atlantean attack unlike any other nation of the  western  known supposedly giving testament to the superiority of plato s concept of a at the end of the story  atlantis eventually falls out of favor with the deities and submerges into the atlantic ocean despite its minor importance in plato s work  the atlantis story has had a considerable impact on literature  the allegorical aspect of atlantis was taken up in utopian works of several renaissance writers  such as francis bacon s new atlantis and thomas more s on the other hand  nineteenth-century  amateur scholars misinterpreted plato s narrative as historical tradition  most notably in ignatius l  donnelly s atlantis  the antediluvian world  plato s vague indications of the time of the events—more than 9,000  years before his the alleged location of atlantis— beyond the pillars of hercules —has led to much pseudoscientific as a consequence  atlantis has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations and continues to inspire contemporary fiction  from comic books to films while present-day  philologists and classicists agree on the story s fictional there is still debate on what served as its inspiration  the fact that plato borrowed some of his other allegories and metaphors—most notably the story of older traditions has caused a number of scholars to investigate possible inspiration of atlantis from egyptian records of the thera eruption  the sea peoples invasion  or the trojan others have rejected this chain of tradition as implausible and insist that plato created an entirely fictional nation as his drawing loose inspiration from contemporary events such as the failed athenian invasion of sicily in 415–413  bc or the destruction of helike in 373  dialogues timaeus and critias  written in 360  bc  contain the earliest references to atlantis  for unknown reasons  plato never completed critias  plato introduced atlantis in timaeus for it is related in our records how once upon a time your state stayed the course of a mighty host  which  starting from a distant point in the atlantic ocean  was insolently advancing to attack the whole of europe  and asia to boot  for the ocean there was at that time navigable  for in front of the mouth which you greeks call  as you say   the pillars of heracles   there lay an island which was larger than libya and asia together  and it was possible for the travelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands  and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses that veritable ocean  for all that we have here  lying within the mouth of which we speak  is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance  but that yonder is a real ocean  and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called  in the fullest and truest sense  a continent  now in this island of atlantis there existed a confederation of kings  of great and marvelous power  which held sway over all the island  and over many other islands also and parts of the four people appearing in those two dialogues are the politicians critias and hermocrates as well as the philosophers socrates and timaeus of locri  although only critias speaks of atlantis  in his works plato makes extensive use of the socratic method in order to discuss contrary positions within the context of a supposition the timaeus begins with an introduction  followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations  in the introduction  socrates muses about the perfect society  described in plato s republic  c  380  bc   and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society  critias mentions a tale he considered to be historical  that would make the perfect example  and he then follows by describing atlantis as is recorded in the critias  in his account  ancient athens seems to represent the  perfect society  and atlantis its opponent  representing the very antithesis of the  perfect  traits described in the republic according to critias  the hellenic deities of old divided the land so that each deity might have their own lot  poseidon was appropriately  and to his liking  bequeathed the island of atlantis  the island was larger than ancient libya and asia minor but it was later sunk by an earthquake and became an impassable mud shoal  inhibiting travel to any part of the ocean  plato asserted that the egyptians described atlantis as an island consisting mostly of mountains in the northern portions and along the shore and encompassing a great plain in an oblong shape in the south  extending in one direction three thousand stadia 555  km  345  mi   but across the center inland it was two thousand stadia 370  km  230  mi    fifty stadia km  6  mi  from the coast was a mountain that was low on all sides     broke it off all round about     the central island itself was five stades in diameter 0.92  km  0.57  mi  in plato s metaphorical tale  poseidon fell in love with cleito  the daughter of evenor and leucippe  who bore him five pairs of male twins  the eldest of these  atlas  was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean  called the atlantic ocean in his honor   and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his fiefdom  atlas s twin gadeirus  or eumelus in greek  was given the extremity of the island toward the pillars of the other four pairs of twins—ampheres and evaemon  mneseus and autochthon  elasippus and mestor  and azaes and diaprepes—were also given  rule over many men  and a large territory  poseidon carved the mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular moats of increasing width  varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size  the atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain  making a route to the rest of the island  they dug a great canal to the sea  and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain  they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats  every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers  and a wall surrounded each ring of the city  the walls were constructed of red  white  and black rock  quarried from the moats  and were covered with brass  tin  and the precious metal orichalcum  respectively according to critias  9,000  years before his lifetime a war took place between those outside the pillars of hercules at the strait of gibraltar and those who dwelt within them  the atlanteans had conquered the parts of libya within the pillars of hercules  as far as egypt  and the european continent as far as tyrrhenia  and had subjected its people to slavery  the athenians led an alliance of resistors against the atlantean empire  and as the alliance disintegrated  prevailed alone against the empire  liberating the occupied lands but afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods  and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth  and the island of atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea  for which reason the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable  because there is a shoal of mud in the way  and this was caused by the subsidence of the logographer hellanicus of lesbos wrote an earlier work entitled atlantis  of which only a few fragments survive  hellanicus  work appears to have been a genealogical one concerning the daughters of atlas  ἀτλαντὶς in greek means  of but some authors have suggested a possible connection with plato s island  john v  luce notes that when plato writes about the genealogy of atlantis s kings  he writes in the same style as hellanicus  suggesting a similarity between a fragment of hellanicus s work and an account in the rodney castleden suggests that plato may have borrowed his title from hellanicus  who may have based his work on an earlier work about has pointed out that plato wrote of atlantis in 359  bc  when he returned to athens from sicily  he notes a number of parallels between the physical organisation and fortifications of syracuse and plato s description of gunnar rudberg was the first who elaborated upon the idea that plato s attempt to realize his political ideas in the city of syracuse could have heavily inspired the atlantis ancient writers viewed atlantis as fictional or metaphorical myth  others believed it to be the philosopher crantor  a student of plato s student xenocrates  is cited often as an example of a writer who thought the story to be historical fact  his work  a commentary on plato s timaeus  is lost  but proclus  a neoplatonist of the fifth century ad  reports on the passage in question has been represented in the modern literature either as claiming that crantor visited egypt  had conversations with priests  and saw hieroglyphs confirming the story  or  as claiming that he learned about them from other visitors to proclus wrote as for the whole of this account of the atlanteans  some say that it is unadorned history  such as crantor  the first commentator on plato  crantor also says that plato s contemporaries used to criticize him jokingly for not being the inventor of his republic but copying the institutions of the egyptians  plato took these critics seriously enough to assign to the egyptians this story about the athenians and atlanteans  so as to make them say that the athenians really once lived according to that system the next sentence is often translated  crantor adds  that this is testified by the prophets of the egyptians  who assert that these particulars are narrated by plato  are written on pillars which are still preserved   but in the original  the sentence starts not with the name crantor but with the ambiguous he  whether this referred to crantor or to plato is the subject of considerable debate  proponents of both atlantis as a metaphorical myth and atlantis as history have argued that the pronoun refers to cameron argues that the pronoun should be interpreted as referring to plato  and that  when proclus writes that  we must bear in mind concerning this whole feat of the athenians  that it is neither a mere myth nor unadorned history  although some take it as history and others as myth   he is treating  crantor s view as mere personal opinion  nothing more  in fact he first quotes and then dismisses it as representing one of the two unacceptable also points out that whether he refers to plato or to crantor  the statement does not support conclusions such as otto muck s  crantor came to sais and saw there in the temple of neith the column  completely covered with hieroglyphs  on which the history of atlantis was recorded  scholars translated it for him  and he testified that their account fully agreed with plato s account of or j  v  luce s suggestion that crantor sent  a special enquiry to egypt  and that he may simply be referring to plato s own passage from the commentary by proclus on the  timaeus  gives a description of the geography of atlantis that an island of such nature and size once existed is evident from what is said by certain authors who investigated the things around the outer sea  for according to them  there were seven islands in that sea in their time  sacred to persephone  and also three others of enormous size  one of which was sacred to hades  another to ammon  and another one between them to poseidon  the extent of which was a thousand stadia km   and the inhabitants of it—they add—preserved the remembrance from their ancestors of the immeasurably large island of atlantis which had really existed there and which for many ages had reigned over all islands in the atlantic sea and which itself had like-wise  been sacred to poseidon  now these things marcellus has written in his remains unidentified other ancient historians and philosophers who believed in the existence of atlantis were strabo and some have theorized that  before the sixth century bc  the  pillars of hercules  may have applied to mountains on either side of the gulf of laconia  and also may have been part of the pillar cult of the the mountains stood at either side of the southernmost gulf in greece  the largest in the peloponnese  and it opens onto the mediterranean sea  this would have placed atlantis in the mediterranean  lending credence to many details in plato s discussion the fourth-century  historian ammianus marcellinus  relying on a lost work by timagenes  a historian writing in the first century bc  writes that the druids of gaul said that part of the inhabitants of gaul had migrated there from distant islands  some have understood ammianus s testimony as a claim that at the time of atlantis s sinking into the sea  its inhabitants fled to western europe  but ammianus  in fact  says that  the drasidae  druids  recall that a part of the population is indigenous but others also migrated in from islands and lands beyond the rhine   res gestae 15.9),  an indication that the immigrants came to gaul from the north  britain  the netherlands  or germany   not from a theorized location in the atlantic ocean to the instead  the celts who dwelled along the ocean were reported to venerate twin gods   dioscori   who appeared to them coming from that the early first century ad  the hellenistic jewish philosopher philo wrote about the destruction of atlantis in his on the eternity of the world  xxvi  141,  in a longer passage allegedly citing aristotle s successor and the island of atalantes spelling  original  ἀτλαντίς  which was greater than africa and asia  as plato says in the timaeus  in one day and night was overwhelmed beneath the sea in consequence of an extraordinary earthquake and inundation and suddenly disappeared  becoming sea  not indeed navigable  but full of gulfs and is the possibility that clement of rome cryptically referred to atlantis in his first epistle of clement  20:  8:...  the ocean which is impassable for men  and the worlds beyond it  are directed by the same ordinances of the theologian joseph barber lightfoot  apostolic fathers  1885,  ii  p  84)  noted on this passage   clement may possibly be referring to some known  but hardly accessible land  lying without the pillars of hercules  but more probably he contemplated some unknown land in the far west beyond the ocean  like the fabled atlantis of plato early christian writers wrote about atlantis  although they had mixed views on whether it once existed or was an untrustworthy myth of pagan tertullian believed atlantis was once real and wrote that in the atlantic ocean once existed isle  that was equal in size to libya or referring to plato s geographical description of atlantis  the early christian apologist writer arnobius also believed atlantis once existed  but blamed its destruction on indicopleustes in the sixth century wrote of atlantis in his christian topography in an attempt to prove his theory that the world was flat and surrounded by in like manner the philosopher timaeus also describes this earth as surrounded by the ocean  and the ocean as surrounded by the more remote earth  for he supposes that there is to westward an island  atlantis  lying out in the ocean  in the direction of gadeira  cadiz   of an enormous magnitude  and relates that the ten kings having procured mercenaries from the nations in this island came from the earth far away  and conquered europe and asia  but were afterwards conquered by the athenians  while that island itself was submerged by god under the sea  both plato and aristotle praise this philosopher  and proclus has written a commentary on him  he himself expresses views similar to our own with some modifications  transferring the scene of the events from the east to the west  moreover he mentions those ten generations as well as that earth which lies beyond the ocean  and in a word it is evident that all of them borrow from moses  and publish his statements as their hebrew treatise on computational astronomy dated to ad 1378/79,  alludes to the atlantis myth in a discussion concerning the determination of zero points for the calculation of needed some say that they inhabited regions  begin at the beginning of the western ocean atlantic  and beyond  for in the earliest times the first days  there was an island in the middle of the ocean  there were scholars there  who isolated themselves in pursuit of  philosophy  in their day  that was the for measuring  the of the inhabited world  today  it has become by the   sea  and it is ten degrees into the sea  and they reckon the beginning of longitude from the beginning of the western from plato s original account  modern interpretations regarding atlantis are an amalgamation of diverse  speculative movements that began in the sixteenth contemporary perceptions of atlantis share roots with mayanism  which can be traced to the beginning of the modern age  when european imaginations were fueled by their initial encounters with the indigenous peoples of the new from this era sprang apocalyptic and utopian visions that would inspire many subsequent generations of of these interpretations are considered pseudohistory  pseudoscience  or pseudoarchaeology  as they have presented their works as academic or scientific  but lack the standards or criteria the flemish cartographer and geographer abraham ortelius is believed to have been the first person to imagine that the continents were joined together before drifting to their present positions  in the 1596  edition of his thesaurus geographicus he wrote   unless it be a fable  the island of gadir or gades will be the remaining part of the island of atlantis or america  which was not sunk  as plato reports in the timaeus  so much as torn away from europe and africa by earthquakes and flood    the traces of the ruptures are shown by the projections of europe and africa and the indentations of america in the parts of the coasts of these three said lands that face each other to anyone who  using a map of the world  carefully considered them  so that anyone may say with strabo in book 2,  that what plato says of the island of atlantis on the authority of solon is not a term  utopia   from  no place   was coined by sir thomas more in his sixteenth-century  work of fiction inspired by plato s atlantis and travelers  accounts of the americas  more described an imaginary land set in the new his idealistic vision established a connection between the americas and utopian societies  a theme that was further solidified by sir francis bacon in the new atlantis  c  a character in the narrative gives a history of atlantis that is similar to plato s and places atlantis in america  people had begun believing that the mayan and aztec ruins could possibly be the remnants of speculation began as to the origins of the maya  which led to a variety of narratives and publications that tried to rationalize the discoveries within the context of the bible and that had undertones of racism in their connections between the old and new world  the europeans believed the indigenous people to be inferior and incapable of building that which was now in ruins and by sharing a common history  they insinuate that another race must have been responsible in the middle and late nineteenth century  several renowned mesoamerican scholars  starting with charles etienne brasseur de bourbourg  and including edward herbert thompson and augustus le plongeon  formally proposed that atlantis was somehow related to mayan and aztec culture the french scholar brasseur de bourbourg traveled extensively through mesoamerica in the mid-1800s,  and was renowned for his translations of mayan texts  most notably the sacred book popol vuh  as well as a comprehensive history of the region  soon after these publications  however  brasseur de bourbourg lost his academic credibility  due to his claim that the maya peoples had descended from the toltecs  people he believed were the surviving population of the racially superior civilization of his work combined with the skillful  romantic illustrations of jean frederic waldeck  which visually alluded to egypt and other aspects of the old world  created an authoritative fantasy that excited much interest in the connections between worlds inspired by brasseur de bourbourg s diffusion theories  the pseudoarchaeologist augustus le plongeon traveled to mesoamerica and performed some of the first excavations of many famous mayan ruins  le plongeon invented narratives  such as the kingdom of moo saga  which romantically drew connections to him  his wife alice  and egyptian deities osiris and isis  as well as to heinrich schliemann  who had just discovered the ancient city of troy from homer s epic poetry  that had been described as merely he also believed that he had found connections between the greek and mayan languages  which produced a narrative of the destruction of 1882  publication of atlantis  the antediluvian world by ignatius l  donnelly stimulated much popular interest in atlantis  he was greatly inspired by early works in mayanism  and like them  attempted to establish that all known ancient civilizations were descended from atlantis  which he saw as a technologically sophisticated  more advanced culture  donnelly drew parallels between creation stories in the old and new worlds  attributing the connections to atlantis  where he believed the biblical garden of eden as implied by the title of his book  he also believed that atlantis was destroyed by the great flood mentioned in the bible donnelly is credited as the  father of the nineteenth century atlantis revival  and is the reason the myth endures he unintentionally promoted an alternative method of inquiry to history and science  and the idea that myths contain hidden information that opens them to  ingenious  interpretation by people who believe they have new or special russian mystic helena petrovna blavatsky and her partner henry steel olcott founded their theosophical society in the 1870s  with a philosophy that combined western romanticism and eastern religious concepts  blavatsky and her followers in this group are often cited as the founders of new age and other spiritual took up donnelly s interpretations when she wrote the secret doctrine (1888),  which she claimed was originally dictated in atlantis  she maintained that the atlanteans were cultural heroes  contrary to plato  who describes them mainly as a military threat   she believed in a form of racial evolution  as opposed to primate evolution   in which the atlanteans were the fourth  root race   succeeded by the fifth and most superior  aryan race   her own the theosophists believed that the civilization of atlantis reached its peak between 1,000,000  and 900,000  years ago  but destroyed itself through internal warfare brought about by the dangerous use of psychic and supernatural powers of the inhabitants  rudolf steiner  the founder of anthroposophy and waldorf schools  along with other well known theosophists  such as annie besant  also wrote of cultural evolution in much the same vein some subsequent occultists have followed blavatsky  at least to the point of tracing the lineage of occult practices back to atlantis  among the most famous is dion fortune in her esoteric orders and their was also inspired by the work of the eighteenth-century  astronomer jean-sylvain  bailly  who had  orientalized  the atlantis myth in his mythical continent of hyperborea  a reference to greek myths featuring a northern european region of the same name  home to a giant  godlike her reshaping of this theory in the secret doctrine provided the nazis with a mythological precedent and a pretext for their ideological platform and their subsequent evola s writing in 1934  also suggested that the atlanteans were hyperborean  nordic supermen who originated at the north pole  see thule   similarly  alfred rosenberg  in the myth of the twentieth century  1930)  spoke of a "nordic-atlantean"  or "aryan-nordic"  master race edgar cayce was a man from humble upbringings in kentucky who allegedly possessed psychic abilities  which were performed from a trance-like  state  in addition to allegedly healing the sick from this state  he also spoke frequently on the topic of atlantis  in his  life readings   he purportedly revealed that many of his subjects were reincarnations of people who had lived on atlantis  by tapping into their collective consciousness  the  akashic records   a term borrowed from he declared that he was able to give detailed descriptions of the lost he also asserted that atlantis would  rise  again in the 1960s   sparking much popularity of the myth in that decade  and that there is a  hall of records  beneath the egyptian sphinx  which holds the historical texts of atlantis as continental drift became widely accepted during the 1960s,  and the increased understanding of plate tectonics demonstrated the impossibility of a lost continent in the geologically recent most  lost continent  theories of atlantis began to wane in popularity plato scholar julia annas  regents professor of philosophy at the university of arizona  had this to say on the matter the continuing industry of discovering atlantis illustrates the dangers of reading plato  for he is clearly using what has become a standard device of fiction—stressing the historicity of an event  and the discovery of hitherto unknown authorities  as an indication that what follows is fiction  the idea is that we should use the story to examine our ideas of government and power  we have missed the point if instead of thinking about these issues we go off exploring the sea bed  the continuing misunderstanding of plato as historian here enables us to see why his distrust of imaginative writing is sometimes of the proposed explanations for the historical context of the atlantis story is a warning of plato to his contemporary fourth-century  fellow-citizens  against their striving for naval feder points out that critias s story in the timaeus provides a major clue  in the dialogue  critias says  referring to socrates  hypothetical society and when you were speaking yesterday about your city and citizens  the tale which i have just been repeating to you came into my mind  and i remarked with astonishment how  by some mysterious coincidence  you agreed in almost every particular with the narrative of solon  quotes a  e  taylor  who wrote   we could not be told much more plainly that the whole narrative of solon s conversation with the priests and his intention of writing the poem about atlantis are an invention of plato s donnelly s day  there have been dozens of locations proposed for atlantis  to the point where the name has become a generic concept  divorced from the specifics of plato s account  this is reflected in the fact that many proposed sites are not within the atlantic at all  few today are scholarly or archaeological hypotheses  while others have been made by psychic  e g   edgar cayce  or other pseudoscientific means   the atlantis researchers jacques collina-girard  and georgeos díaz-montexano,  for instance  each claim the other s hypothesis is many of the proposed sites share some of the characteristics of the atlantis story  water  catastrophic end  relevant time period   but none has been demonstrated to be a true historical atlantis most of the historically proposed locations are

the nearby island of crete  further leading some to believe that this may have been the catastrophe that inspired the g  galanopoulos argued that plato s dating of 9,000  years before solon s time was the result of an error in translation  probably from egyptian into greek  which produced  thousands  instead of  hundreds   such an error would also rescale plato s atlantis to the size of crete  while leaving the city the size of the crater on thera  900  years before solon would be the fifteenth century in the area of the black sea the following locations have been proposed  bosporus and ancomah  a legendary place near trabzon  others have noted that  before the sixth century bc  the mountains on either side of the gulf of laconia were called the  pillars of and they could be the geographical location being described in ancient reports upon which plato was basing his story  the mountains stood at either side of the southernmost gulf in greece  the largest in the peloponnese  and that gulf opens onto the mediterranean sea  if from the beginning of discussions  misinterpretation of gibraltar as the location rather than being at the gulf of laconia  would lend itself to many erroneous concepts regarding the location of atlantis  plato may have not been aware of the difference  the laconian pillars open to the south toward crete and beyond which is egypt  the thera eruption and the late bronze age collapse affected that area and might have been the devastation to which the sources used by plato referred  significant events such as these would have been likely material for tales passed from one generation to another for almost a thousand years the location of atlantis in the atlantic ocean has a certain appeal given the closely related names  popular culture often places atlantis there  perpetuating the original platonic setting as they understand it  the canary islands and madeira islands have been identified as a possible west of the straits of gibraltar  but in relative proximity to the mediterranean sea  detailed studies of their geomorphology and geology have demonstrated  however  that they have been steadily uplifted  without any significant periods of subsidence  over the last four million years  by geologic processes such as erosional unloading  gravitational unloading  lithospheric flexure induced by adjacent islands  and volcanic various islands or island groups in the atlantic were also identified as possible locations  notably the similarly  cores of sediment covering the ocean bottom surrounding the azores and other evidence demonstrate that it has been an undersea plateau for millions of the submerged island of spartel near the strait of gibraltar has also been hypotheses place the sunken island in

national geographic led by professor richard freund from the university of hartford  claimed to have found possible evidence of atlantis in southwestern the team identified its possible location

anthropologist juan villarías-robles,  who works with the spanish national research council  said   richard freund was a newcomer to our project and appeared to be involved in his own very controversial issue concerning king solomon s search for ivory and gold in tartessos  the well documented settlement in the doñana area established in the first millennium bc   and described freund s claims as similar theory had previously been put forward by a german researcher  rainer w  kühne  that is based only on satellite imagery and places atlantis in the marismas de hinojos  north of the

others have proposed caribbean locations such as the alleged cuban sunken city off the guanahacabibes peninsula in the bahamas  and the bermuda triangle  areas in the pacific and indian oceans have also been proposed including indonesia  i e  likewise some have speculated that the continent of south america bears striking similarities to the description of atlantis by plato  particularly the altiplano region of the andes  the stories of a lost continent off the coast of india  named  kumari kandam   have inspired some to draw parallels to order to give his account of atlantis verisimilitude  plato mentions that the story was heard by solon in egypt  and transmitted orally over several generations through the family of dropides  until it reached critias  a dialogue speaker in timaeus and solon had supposedly tried to adapt the atlantis oral tradition into a poem  that if published  was to be greater than the works of hesiod and homer   while it was never completed  solon passed on the story to dropides  modern classicists deny the existence of solon s atlantis poem and the story as an oral instead  plato is thought to be the sole inventor or fabricator  hellanicus of lesbos used the word atlantis as the title for a poem published before a fragment of which may be oxyrhynchus papyrus 11,  this work only describes the atlantides  the daughters of atlas   however  and has no relation to plato s atlantis account in the new era  the third century ad neoplatonist zoticus wrote an epic poem based on plato s account of plato s work may already have inspired parodic imitation  however  writing only a few decades after the timaeus and critias  the historian theopompus of chios wrote of a land beyond the ocean known as meropis  this description was included in book 8  of his philippica  which contains a dialogue between silenus and king midas  silenus describes the meropids  a race of men who grow to twice normal size  and inhabit two cities on the island of meropis  eusebes  εὐσεβής  "pious-town")  and machimos  μάχιμος  "fighting-town").  he also reports that an army of ten million soldiers crossed the ocean to conquer hyperborea  but abandoned this proposal when they realized that the hyperboreans were the luckiest people on earth  heinz-günther  nesselrath has argued that these and other details of silenus  story are meant as imitation and exaggeration of the atlantis story  by parody  for the purpose of exposing plato s ideas to creation of utopian and dystopian fictions was renewed after the renaissance  most notably in francis bacon’s new atlantis (1627),  the description of an ideal society that he located off the western coast of america  thomas heyrick (1649-1694)  followed him with “the new atlantis” (1687),  a

second edition as “a true character of popery and title of the new atalantis by delarivier manley (1709),  distinguished from the two others by the single letter  is an equally dystopian work but set
