 overfishing -  wikipediaoverfishing is a form of overexploitation where fish stocks are reduced to below acceptable levels  overfishing can occur in water bodies of any sizes  such as ponds  rivers  lakes or oceans  and can result in resource depletion  reduced biological growth rates and low biomass levels  sustained overfishing can lead to critical depensation  where the fish population is no longer able to sustain itself  some forms of overfishing  for example the overfishing of sharks  has led to the upset of entire marine ability of a fishery to recover from overfishing depends on whether the ecosystem s conditions are suitable for the recovery  dramatic changes in species composition can result in an ecosystem shift  where other equilibrium energy flows involve species compositions different from those that had been present before the depletion of the original fish stock  for example  once trout have been overfished  carp might take over in a way that makes it impossible for the trout to re-establish  a breeding population overfishing occurs when more fish are caught than the population can replace through natural reproduction  gathering as many fish as possible may seem like a profitable practice  but overfishing has serious consequences  the results not only affect the balance of life in the oceans  but also the social and economic well-being  of the coastal communities who depend on fish for their way of life overfishing has greatly affected many fisheries around the world  as much as 85%  of the world s fisheries may be over-exploited,  depleted  fully exploited or in recovery from significant overfishing has been observed in pre-industrial  times  in particular  the overfishing of the western atlantic ocean from the earliest days of european colonisation of the americas has been well following world war two  industrial fishing rapidly expanded with rapid increases in worldwide fishing catches  however  many fisheries have either collapsed or degraded to a point where increased catches are no longer possible daniel pauly  a fisheries scientist known for pioneering work on the human impacts on global fisheries  has is almost as though we use our military to fight the animals in the ocean  we are gradually winning this war to exterminate them  and to see this destruction happen  for nothing really – for no reason – that is a bit frustrating  strangely enough  these effects are all reversible  all the animals that have disappeared would reappear  all the animals that were small would grow  all the relationships that you can t see any more would re-establish  themselves  and the system would re-emerge.examples  of overfishing exist in areas such as the north sea  the grand banks of newfoundland and the east china in these locations  overfishing has not only proved disastrous to fish stocks but also to the fishing communities relying on the harvest  like other extractive industries such as forestry and hunting  fisheries are susceptible to economic interaction between ownership or stewardship and sustainability  otherwise known as the tragedy of the commons several countries are now effectively managing their fisheries  examples include iceland and new the united states has turned many of its fisheries around from being in a highly depleted to a 2008  un report  the world s fishing fleets are losing us$50  billion each year through depleted stocks and poor fisheries management  the report  produced jointly by the world bank and the un food and agriculture organization  fao   asserts that half the world s fishing fleet could be scrapped with no change in catch  in addition  the biomass of global fish stocks have been allowed to run down to the point where it is no longer possible to catch the amount of fish that could be increased incidence of schistosomiasis in africa has been linked to declines of fish species that eat the snails carrying the disease-causing  massive growth of jellyfish populations threaten fish stocks  as they compete with fish for food  eat fish eggs  and poison or swarm fish  and can survive in oxygen depleted environments where fish cannot  they wreak massive havoc on commercial fisheries  overfishing eliminates a major jellyfish competitor and predator exacerbating the jellyfish population both climate change and a restructuring of the ecosystem have been found to be major roles in an increase in jellyfish population in the irish sea in the are three recognized types of biological overfishing  growth overfishing  recruit overfishing and ecosystem overfishing growth overfishing occurs when fish are harvested at an average size that is smaller than the size that would produce the maximum yield per recruit  a recruit is an individual that makes it to maturity  or into the limits specified by a fishery  which are usually size or this makes the total yield less than it would be if the fish were allowed to grow to an appropriate size  it can be countered by reducing fishing mortality to lower levels and increasing the average size of harvested fish to a size that will allow maximum yield per overfishing occurs when the mature adult population  spawning biomass  is depleted to a level where it no longer has the reproductive capacity to replenish itself—there are not enough adults to produce increasing the spawning stock biomass to a target level is the approach taken by managers to restore an overfished population to sustainable levels  this is generally accomplished by placing moratoriums  quotas and minimum size limits on a fish population ecosystem overfishing occurs when the balance of the ecosystem is altered by overfishing  with declines in the abundance of large predatory species  the abundance of small forage type increases causing a shift in the balance of the ecosystem towards smaller fish species the notion of overfishing hinges on what is meant by an acceptable level of fishing  more precise biological and bioeconomic terms define acceptable level as follows a model proposed in 2010  for predicting acceptable levels of fishing is the harvest control rule which is a set of tools and protocols with which management has some direct control of harvest rates and strategies in relation to predicting stock status  and long-term  maximum sustainable yields  constant catch and constant fishing mortality are two types of simple harvest control capacity can also be defined using an input or output orientation technical efficiency of each vessel of the fleet is assumed necessary to attain this maximum catch  the degree of capacity utilization results from the comparison of the actual level of output  input  and the capacity output  input  of a vessel or a needed with present and forecast world population levels it is not possible to solve the over fishing needed  however  there are mitigation measures that can save selected fisheries and forestall the collapse of others in order to meet the problems of overfishing  a precautionary approach and harvest control rule  hcr  management principles have been introduced in the main fisheries around the world  the traffic light color convention introduces sets of rules based on predefined critical values  which could be adjusted as more information is gained the united nations convention on the law of the sea treaty deals with aspects of over fishing in articles 61,  62,  and to some observers  overfishing can be viewed as an example of the tragedy of the commons  appropriate solutions would therefore promote property rights through  for instance  privatization and fish farming  daniel k  benjamin  in fisheries are classic example of the  tragedy of the commons   cites research by grafton  squires and fox to support the idea that privatization can solve the overfishing possible solution  at least for some areas  is quotas  so fishermen can only legally take a certain amount of fish  a more radical possibility is declaring certain areas of the sea "no-go  zones  and make fishing there strictly illegal  so the fish in that area have time to recover and repopulate controlling consumer behavior and demand is a key in mitigating action  worldwide  a number of initiatives emerged to provide consumers with information regarding the conservation status of the seafood available to them  the guide to good fish guides lists a number of these many regulatory measures are available for controlling overfishing  these measures include fishing quotas  bag limits  licensing  closed seasons  size limits and the creation of marine reserves and other marine protected areas a model of the interaction between fish and fishers showed that when an area is closed to fishers  but there are no catch regulations such as individual transferable quotas  fish catches are temporarily increased but overall fish biomass is reduced  resulting in the opposite outcome from the one desired for thus  a displacement of the fleet from one locality to another will generally have little effect if the same quota is taken  as a result  management measures such as temporary closures or establishing a marine protected area of fishing areas are ineffective when not combined with individual fishing quotas  an inherent problem with quotas is that fish populations vary from year to year  a study has found that fish populations rise dramatically after stormy years due to more nutrients reaching the surface and therefore greater primary to fish sustainably  quotas need to be changed each year to account for fish population individual transferable quotas  itqs  are fishery rationalization instruments defined under the magnuson-stevens  fishery conservation and management act as limited access permits to harvest quantities of fish  fisheries scientists decide the optimal amount of fish  total allowable catch  to be harvested in a certain fishery  the decision considers carrying capacity  regeneration rates and future values  under itqs  members of a fishery are granted rights to a percentage of the total allowable catch that can be harvested each year  these quotas can be fished  bought  sold  or leased allowing for the least cost vessels to be used  itqs are used in new zealand  australia  iceland  canada  and the united states  only three itq programs have been implemented in the united states due to a moratorium supported by ted stevens in 2008,  a large-scale  study of fisheries that used itqs compared to ones that didn t provided strong evidence that itqs can help to prevent collapses and restore fisheries that appear to be in bans fishing in the south china sea for a period each scientists have called for an end to subsidies paid to deep sea fisheries  in international waters beyond the 200  nautical mile exclusive economic zones of coastal countries  many fisheries are unregulated  and fishing fleets plunder the depths with state-of-the-art  technology  in a few hours  massive nets weighing up to 15  tons  dragged along the bottom by deep-water  trawlers  can destroy deep-sea  corals and sponge beds that have taken centuries or millennia to grow  the trawlers can target orange roughy  grenadiers  or sharks  these fish are usually long-lived  and late maturing  and their populations take decades  even centuries to scientist daniel pauly and economist ussif rashid sumaila have examined subsidies paid to bottom trawl fleets around the world  they found that us$152  million per year are paid to deep-sea  fisheries  without these subsidies  global deep-sea  fisheries would operate at a loss of $50  million a year  a great deal of the subsidies paid to deep-sea  trawlers is to subsidize the large amount of fuel required to travel beyond the 200-mile  limit and drag weighted is surely a better way for governments to spend money than by paying subsidies to a fleet that burns 1.1  billion litres of fuel annually to maintain paltry catches of old growth fish from highly vulnerable stocks  while destroying their habitat in the process  – global subsidies would render these fleets economically unviable and would relieve tremendous pressure on over-fishing  and vulnerable deep-sea  ecosystems  – techniques may be altered to minimize bycatch and reduce impacts on marine habitats  these techniques include using varied gear types depending on target species and habitat type  for example  a net with larger holes will allow undersized fish to avoid capture  a turtle excluder device  ted  allows sea turtles and other megafauna to escape from shrimp trawls  avoiding fishing in spawning grounds may allow fish stocks to rebuild by giving adults a chance to reproduce aquaculture involves the farming of fish in captivity  this approach effectively privatizes fish stocks and creates incentives for farmers to conserve their stocks  it also reduces environmental impact  however  farming carnivorous fish  such as salmon  does not always reduce pressure on wild fisheries  since carnivorous farmed fish are usually fed fishmeal and fish oil extracted from wild forage fish aquaculture played a minor role in the harvesting of marine organisms until the 1970s.  growth in aquaculture increased rapidly in 1990s  when the rate of wild capture plateaued  aquaculture now provides approximately half of all harvested aquatic organisms  aquaculture production rates continue to grow while wild harvest remains steady fish farming can enclose the entire breeding cycle of the fish  with fish being bred in captivity  some fish prove difficult to breed in captivity and can be caught in the wild as juveniles and brought into captivity to increase their weight  with scientific progress more species are being made to breed in captivity  this was the case with southern bluefin tuna  which were first bred in captivity in seafood is a movement that has gained momentum as more people become aware of overfishing and environmentally destructive fishing methods  sustainable seafood is seafood from either fished or farmed sources that can maintain or increase production in the future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired  in general  slow-growing  fish that reproduce late in life  such as orange roughy  are vulnerable to overfishing  seafood species that grow quickly and breed young  such as anchovies and sardines  are much more resistant to overfishing  several organizations  including the marine stewardship council  msc   and friend of the sea  certify seafood fisheries as needed the marine stewardship council has developed an environmental standard for sustainable and well-managed  fisheries  environmentally responsible fisheries management and practices are rewarded with the use of its blue product ecolabel  consumers concerned about overfishing and its consequences are increasingly able to choose seafood products that have been independently assessed against the msc s environmental standard  this enables consumers to play a part in reversing the decline of fish stocks  as of february 2012,  over 100  fisheries around the world have been independently assessed and certified as meeting the msc standard  their where-to-buy  page lists the currently available certified seafood  as of february 2012  over 13,000  msc-labelled  products are available in 74  countries around the world  fish   kids is an msc project to teach schoolchildren about marine environmental issues  including overfishing the monterey bay aquarium s seafood watch program  although not an official certifying body like the msc  also provides guidance on the sustainability of certain fish some seafood restaurants have begun to offer more sustainable seafood options  the seafood choices is an organization whose members include chefs that serve sustainable seafood at their establishments  in the us  the sustainable fisheries act defines sustainable practices through national standards  although there is no official certifying body like the msc  the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has created fishwatch to help guide concerned consumers to sustainable seafood choices  see also a guide to good fish guides in september 2016,  a partnership of google and oceana and skytruth introduced global fishing watch  a website designed to assist citizens of the globe in monitoring fishing awareness of overfishing and effective measures can be effective in fisheries management  improving awareness of regulations can improve compliance  also  creating public awareness of environmental impacts of fishing can lead to fishermen voluntarily engaging in practices such as catch and release the fishing industry has a strong financial incentive to oppose some measures aimed at improving the sustainability of fish recreational fisherman also have an interest in maintaining access to fish stocks  this leads to extensive lobbying that can block or water down government policies intended to prevent overfishing outside of countries  exclusive economic zones  fishing is difficult to control  large oceangoing fishing boats are free to exploit fish stocks at needed in waters that are the subject of territorial disputes  countries may actively encourage overfishing  a notable example is the cod wars where britain used its navy to protect its trawlers fishing in iceland s exclusive economic needed  fish are highly transitory  many species will freely move through different jurisdictions  the conservation efforts of one country can then be exploited by another while governments can create regulations to control people s behaviours this can be undermined by illegal fishing activity  estimates of the size of the illegal catch range from 11  to 26  million tonnes  which represents 14-33%  of the world s reported illegal fishing can take many forms  in some developing countries  large numbers of poor people are dependent on fishing  it can prove difficult to regulate this kind of overfishing  especially for weak governments  even in regulated environments  illegal fishing may occur  while industrial fishing is often effectively controlled  smaller scale and recreational fishermen can often break regulations such as bag limits and seasonal closures  fisherman can also easily fish illegally by doing things such as underreporting the amount of fish they caught or reporting that they caught one type of fish while actually catching there is also a large problem with surveillance of illegal fishing activity  in 2001,  the un food and agriculture organization  fao   passed the international plan of action to prevent  deter and eliminate illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing (ipoa-iuu).  this is an agreement with the intention to stop port states from allowing boats to dock that participated in illegal  unreported or unregulated fishing  it also gives details for port states on effective measures of inspecting and reporting illegal some illegal fishing takes place on an industrial scale with financed commercial needed the fishing capacity problem is not only related to the conservation of fish stocks but also to the sustainability of fishing activity  causes of the fishing problem can be found in the property rights regime of fishing resources  overexploitation and rent dissipation of fishermen arise in open-access  fisheries as was shown in open-access  resources like fish stocks  in the absence of a system like individual transferable quotas  the impossibility of excluding others provokes the fishermen who want to increase catch to do so effectively by taking someone else  share  intensifying competition  this tragedy of the commons provokes a capitalization process that leads them to increase their costs until they are equal to their revenue  dissipating their rent needed there is always disagreement between fishermen and government scientists    imagine an overfished area of the sea in the shape of a hockey field with nets at either end  the few fish left therein would gather around the goals because fish like structured habitats  scientists would survey the entire field  make lots of unsuccessful hauls  and conclude that it contains few fish  the fishermen would make a beeline to the goals  catch the fish around them  and say the scientists do not know what they are talking about  the subjective impression the fishermen get is always that there s lots of fish -  because they only go to places that still have them    fisheries scientists survey and compare entire areas  not only the productive fishing – fisheries scientist daniel pauly
