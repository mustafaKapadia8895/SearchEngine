 empire state building -  wikipediathe empire state building is a art deco skyscraper on fifth avenue between west 33rd  and 34th  streets in midtown manhattan  new york city  designed by shreve  lamb   harmon  the building has a roof height of 1,250  feet (380  m   and with its antenna included  it stands a total of 1,454  feet (443.2  m  tall  its name is derived from  empire state   the nickname for new york  as of the empire state building is the fifth-tallest  completed skyscraper in the united states and the 28th-tallest  in the world  it is also the sixth-tallest  freestanding structure in the americas  when measured by pinnacle height  it is the fifth-tallest  building in the united states the site of the empire state building was first developed as part of john thompson s farm in the early 18th  century  in the late 1820s,  it came into the possession of the prominent astor family  with john jacob astor s descendants building the waldorf–astoria hotel on the site in the 1890s.  by the 1920s,  the family sold the outdated hotel  and the site indirectly ended up under the ownership of empire state inc   a business venture that included businessman john j  raskob and former new york governor alfred e  smith  the empire state building  as it was then dubbed  was originally supposed to be a standard 50-story  office building  however  the original plans were revised fifteen times  with the tower ultimately being expanded to a 1,250-foot  building with 86  stories and an airship mast on top  this ensured the empire state building would be the world s tallest building  beating out the chrysler building and 40  wall street  two other manhattan skyscrapers under construction at the time that were also vying for that honor demolition of the waldorf–astoria began in october 1929,  and the foundation of the empire state building was excavated before demolition was even complete  construction on the building itself started on march 17,  1930,  with an average construction rate of one floor per day  a well-coordinated  schedule meant that the 86  stories were topped out by september 19  of the same year  with the mast completed by november 21.  from that point  interior work proceeded at a quick pace  and the empire state building was opened on may 1,  1931,  thirteen and a half months after the first steel beam was erected  despite the publicity surrounding the building s construction  the building s owners failed to make a profit until the early 1950s.  however  it has been a popular tourist attraction since opening  with around 4  million visitors to the building s 86th  and 102nd  floor observatories every year the empire state building stood as the world s tallest building for nearly 40  years  from its completion until the topping out of the original world trade center s north tower in lower manhattan in late 1970.  following the september 11  attacks in 2001,  the empire state building was again the tallest building in new york  until one world trade center reached a greater height in april 2012.the  empire state building is an american cultural icon  having been featured in dozens of tv shows and movies since king kong was released in 1933.  a symbol of new york city  it has been named as one of the seven wonders of the modern world by the american society of civil engineers  the building and its street floor interior are designated landmarks of the new york city landmarks preservation commission  and confirmed by the new york city board of estimate  it was designated as a national historic landmark in 1986.  in 2007,  it was ranked number one on the aia s list of america s favorite architecture the empire state building is located at 350  fifth avenue in manhattan  on the street s west side between 33rd  and 34th  although physically located in south a mixed residential and commercial the building is so large that it uses its own zip code of being one of 43  buildings in new york city that has

to one account  shots rang out on what is now fifth avenue from  the battle of the cornfield   some 3,500  of george washington s troops were in the city and in danger of being trapped by the british at the time  mary and john murray owned a farm on murray hill  within the area from present-day  madison avenue to lexington avenue between 34th  and 38th  mary invited the british officers into her home for food and drink  while general putnam was able to lead the 3,500  men out of the city and into harlem 1799,  john thompson  or thomson  accounts bought a 20-acre  (8  ha  tract of land roughly bounded by madison avenue  36th  street  sixth avenue  and 33rd  street  immediately north of the caspar samler farm  for 482  british pounds  roughly us$2400  at the at the time  a stream called t oude wrack  dutch for  old wreck   ran across the site  emptying into sunfish pond  located at the present-day  park avenue south and 31st  street in kips bay  the stream originated at what is now broadway and 44th  street in the middle of times a glue factory polluted sunfish pond heavily during the 1820s,  and it was infilled in 1839  after most of its water was used to extinguish a fire at the new york house of was said to have sold the farm to charles lawton for $10,000  on september 24,  although details of this sale are unclear  as details of the deed that certified the sale were later in 1826,  john jacob astor of the prominent astor family bought the land from lawton for the astors also purchased a parcel from the john jacob s son william backhouse astor sr  bought a half interest on july 28,  1827,  for for a tract of land on fifth avenue from 32nd  to 35th  the astors had intended to simply reserve the land for possible future development  but the deadly astor place riot in 1849  forced the astor family to flee to their midtown william built an unpretentious square red brick house on the southwest corner of 34th  street and fifth avenue in 1859,  while his brother john jacob astor jr  erected a home at the northwest corner of 33rd  street in 1890,  william waldorf astor  the grandson of john sr  and son of john jr   inherited his father s mansion at the corner of fifth avenue and 33rd  street  and started building the waldorf hotel on the site  this decision originated in part from a dispute with his aunt caroline webster schermerhorn astor  the wife of john jacob astor iii who lived next door  and whether caroline or mary dahlgren paul astor  william s wife  would be known in society as  the  mrs  the planned hotel was supposed to be an 11-story  building  as per the specifications of founding proprietor george boldt  but his wife louise believed that 13  was a lucky number and persuaded her husband to add two floors to the william astor s construction of a hotel next to his aunt s house caused both astors to threaten to demolish their home and build a stable on the but with boldt s assistance  john astor persuaded his mother to move the waldorf hotel  named after the astors  ancestral home in the little german town of walldorf  was opened for business march 13,  a decision was made to build a second hotel next to the waldorf  truce provisions were developed between the astors  including the use of corridors between the buildings that could be bricked up if on november 1,  1897,  waldorf s cousin  john jacob astor iv  opened the 16-story  astoria hotel on an adjacent the astoria  named after the oregon town of astoria that had been founded by john sr  in 1811,  stood on the site of william sr s house  and was leased to the two hotels  under one management  were renamed the the hotel became  according to author sean dennis cashman   a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the astor the hotel was frequented by the four hundred  the social elite of new combined hotel had 1,300  bedrooms  making it the largest hotel in the world at the of these  the astoria portion contained 25  public rooms and 550  guest while the waldorf portion contained 15  public rooms  450  guest rooms  and 100  rooms for it was designed specifically to cater to the needs of socially prominent  wealthy upper crust  of new york and distinguished foreign visitors to the it was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private the waldorf gained world renown for its fundraising dinners and died in early 1918,  and coleman du pont bought the hotel s lease soon after boldt s by the 1920s,  the hotel was becoming dated  and the elegant social life of new york had moved much farther north than 34th  the astor family decided to build a replacement hotel further and sold the hotel to the bethlehem engineering corporation in 1928  for $14–16  they closed the hotel on may 3,  the waldorf–astoria hotel records of 1893–1929  are held by the new york public library s archives   manuscripts bethlehem engineering corporation originally wanted to build a 25-story  office building on the waldorf–astoria s site  the company s president  floyd de l  brown  paid $100,000  of the $1  million down payment required to start construction on the tower  with the promise that the difference would be paid brown borrowed $900,000  from a bank  but then defaulted on the land was then resold to empire state inc   a group of wealthy investors that included louis g  kaufman  ellis p  earle  john j  raskob  coleman du pont  and pierre s  du the name came from the state nickname for new alfred e  smith  a former governor of new york and a former u s  presidential candidate whose 1928  campaign had been managed by was appointed as the head of the the empire state inc  consortium became public in august the group also purchased nearby land plots so they would have the 2  acres (1  ha  needed for the tower s base  with the combined plot measuring 425  feet (130  m  wide by 200  feet (61  m  state inc  hired william f  lamb  from the architectural firm shreve  lamb and harmon  to design the lamb produced the building drawings in just two weeks  using the firm s earlier designs for the reynolds building in winston-salem,  north carolina  as a meanwhile  lamb s partner richmond shreve created  bug diagrams  of what needed to be done simultaneously  coordinating tasks to the because of the 1916  zoning act  lamb could not build a structure with walls that ascended straight up from the street  instead  they were required to incorporate setbacks  making the lower floors much larger than the upper floors  as a result  the tower was designed from the top which gave it a "pencil"-like  during the design process  raskob put a large pencil on a table and asked lamb   how high could you make it so it won t fall the original plan for the building was slated to be 50  but the height was later increased to 60  and then 80  the planned 80-story  with a height of about 1,000  feet (300  would have height limits on nearby buildings ensuring that the top fifty floors would get expansive views of the the new york times lauded the site s proximity to transportation  with the brooklyn–manhattan transit s 34th  street station and the hudson and manhattan railroad s 33rd  street terminal one block away  as well as penn station two blocks away and the grand central terminal nine blocks away at its closest  it also praised the 3,000,000  square feet (280,000  m2)  of proposed floor space near  one of the busiest sections in the plans for the empire state building were being finalized  there was an intense competition in new york for the title of  world s tallest building   and the 40  wall street  then the bank of manhattan building  and the chrysler building in manhattan were both under construction when work began on the empire state the  race into the sky   as popular media called it at the time  was representative of the country s optimism in the 1920s,  fueled by the building boom in major the 40  wall street tower was revised from 840  feet (260  m  to 925  feet (282  m  in april 1929,  making it the world s the chrysler building added its 185-foot  (56  m  steel tip to its roof in october 1929,  bringing it to a height of 1,046  feet (319  m  and greatly exceeding 40  wall street s the chrysler building s developer  walter chrysler  realized that his tower s height would exceed the empire state building s as well  having ordered his architect william van alen to change the chrysler s original roof from a stubby romanesque dome to the narrow steel raskob  wishing to have the empire state building be the world s tallest  reviewed the plans and realized that he could add five more floors and a spire of his own  however  the new floors would need to be set back because of projected wind pressure on the on november 18,  1929,  smith acquired a lot at 27–31  west 33rd  street  adding 75  feet (23  m  to the width of the proposed office building s two days later  smith announced the updated plans for the skyscraper  with an observation deck on the 86th-floor  roof at a height of 1,050  feet (320  m   higher than the chrysler s 71st-floor  observation 1,050-foot  empire state building would only be 4  feet (1.2  m  taller than the chrysler and raskob was afraid that chrysler might try to  pull a trick like hiding a rod in the spire and then sticking it up at the last the plans were revised one last time in december 1929,  with a 16-story,  200-foot  (61  m  metal  crown  and an additional 222-foot  (68  m  dirigible mooring mast  the roof height was now 1,250  feet (380  m   making it the tallest building in the world by far  even without the the addition of the dirigible station meant that another floor  the now-enclosed  86th  floor  would have to be built below the however  unlike the chrysler s spire  the empire state s mast would serve a practical by this time the blueprints for the building had gone through up to fifteen versions before they were lamb described the other specifications he was given for the final  approved plan the program was short enough—a fixed budget  no space more than 28  feet from window to corridor  as many stories of such space as possible  an exterior of limestone  and completion date

general builders supply corporation supplied the building john w  bowser was the project s construction and the structural engineer of the building was homer g  the plans were worked out such that construction started on one task before plans for others were of the old waldorf–astoria began on october 1,  stripping the building s materials was an arduous process  as the hotel was made of stiffer material than earlier buildings had  and the granite  precious metals  and wood chips used in the old hotel were not in high most of the wood eventually either went into a woodpile on nearby 30th  street or was burned in a swamp elsewhere  a lot of the other materials that made up the old hotel  including the granite and bronze  were dumped into the atlantic ocean off the shore of sandy hook  new the time the hotel s demolition started  raskob had secured all of the investors that he needed to fund the construction of the the plan was to start construction later that year  but on october 24,  the new york stock exchange started a steep and sudden crash  sparking what would become the decade-long  great depression  even so  raskob refused to cancel the project because of the progress that had been made up to that neither raskob nor smith lost much money in the crash  raskob because he had stopped his speculation about the stock market the previous year  smith because he had never invested a great amount of money in the however  most of their investors did lose money  and as a result  in december of that year  the metropolitan life insurance company loaned empire state inc  some $27.5  million so the group could start even though the stock market crash obviated the need for any new office space  raskob and smith proceeded to start construction since canceling the project would cause investors to incur great structural steel contract was awarded on january 12,  and excavation of the site began ten days later on january before the old hotel had been completely two twelve-hour  shifts  consisting of 300  men each  worked continuously to dig the 55-foot  (17  m  small pier holes were sunk into the ground to house the concrete footings that would support the excavation was nearly complete by early and construction on the building itself started on march with the builders placing the first steel columns on the completed footings before the rest of the footings had been around this time  lamb held a press conference on the building plans  he described the reflective steel panels parallel to the windows  the large-block  indiana limestone facade that was slightly more expensive than smaller bricks  and the tower s lines and four colossal columns  intended for installation in the center of the building site  were delivered  they would support a combined 10,000,000  pounds (4,500,000  kg  when the building was building s structural steel was pre-ordered  and pre-fabricated  in anticipation of a revision to the city s building code that would have allowed the empire state building s structural steel to carry 18,000  pounds per square inch (124,106  kpa   up from 16,000  pounds per square inch (110,316  kpa   thus reducing the amount of steel needed for the building  although the 18,000-psi  regulation had been safely enacted in other cities  mayor jimmy walker did not sign the new codes into law until march 26,  1930,  just before the steel was about to be the first steel framework was put into place on april 1,  from there  construction proceeded at a fast pace  during one stretch of 10  working days  the builders erected fourteen this was made possible due to the extremely precise coordination of the building s planning  as well as the mass production of common materials such as windows and for instance  after a supplier of dark hauteville marble could not deliver enough material on time  starrett switched to using rose famosa marble from a german quarry that was purchased specifically to provide the project with sufficient scale of the project was massive  with trucks carrying "16,000  partition tiles  5,000  bags of cement  450  cubic yards m3]  of sand and 300  bags of lime  arriving at the construction site every there were also cafes and concession stands on five of the incomplete floors so workers did not have to descend to the ground level to eat temporary water taps were also built so that workers did not waste time buying water bottles from the ground additionally  small railway systems carried materials from the basement storage to elevators that brought the carts to the desired floors  where the carts then delivered the materials across that level directly by using another set of tracks on that the 57,480  short tons (51,320  long tons  of steel ordered for the project was the largest-ever  single order of steel at the time  comprising more steel than was ordered for the chrysler building and 40  wall street according to historian john tauranac  the materials for the building came from far and wide  with  limestone from indiana  steel girders from pittsburgh  cement and mortar from upper new york state  marble from italy  france  and england  wood from northern and pacific coast forests  hardware from new june 20,  the steel structure had risen to the 26th  floor  and by july 27,  half of the steel skeleton had been starrett bros  and eken endeavored to build one floor a day in order to speed up construction  a goal that they almost reached with their pace of 4  1⁄2  stories per week  prior to this  the fastest pace of construction for a building of similar height had been 3  1⁄2  stories per in the meantime  the final designs for the floors were being designed from the ground up  as opposed to the general design  which had been from the roof down   some of the levels were still undergoing final approval  with several orders placed within an hour of a plan s being on september 10,  as steelwork was nearing completion  smith laid the building s cornerstone during a ceremony attended by thousands  the stone contained a box with contemporary artifacts such as the previous day s new york times  a u s  currency set containing all denominations of notes and coins minted in 1930;  a history of the site and building  and photographs of the people involved in the steel structure was topped out at 1,048  feet (319  m  on september 19,  twelve days ahead of schedule and 23  weeks after the start of workers raised a flag atop the 86th  floor to signify this work on the building s interior and crowning mast the mooring mast topped out on november 21,  two months after the steelwork had been meanwhile  work on the walls and interior was progressing at a quick pace  with exterior walls built up to the 75th  floor by the time steelwork had been built to the 95th  the majority of the facade was already finished by the middle of because of the building s height  it was deemed infeasible to have many elevators or large elevator cabins  so the builders contracted with the otis elevator company to make 66  cars that could speed at 1,200  feet per minute (366  m min   which represented the largest-ever  elevator order at the addition to the time constraint builders had  there were also space limitations because construction materials had to be delivered quickly  and trucks needed to drop off these materials without congesting traffic  this was solved by creating a temporary driveway for the trucks between 33rd  and 34th  streets  and then storing the materials in the building s first floor and basements  concrete mixers  brick hoppers  and stone hoists inside the building ensured that materials would be able to ascend quickly and without endangering or inconveniencing the at one point  over 200  trucks made material deliveries at the building site every a series of relay and erection derricks  placed on platforms erected near the building  lifted the steel from the trucks below and installed

ironworkers from the kahnawake reserve near according to official accounts  five workers died during the although the new york daily news gave reports of 14  and a headline in the socialist magazine the new masses spread unfounded rumors of up to 42  hine took a myriad of photographs providing not only a documentation of the construction  but also a glimpse into common day life of workers in that hine s images provided much fodder for the media  with many news sources publishing daily press releases that featured one of hine s according to jim rasenberger  hine  climbed out onto the steel with the ironworkers and dangled from a derrick cable hundreds of feet above the city to capture  as no one ever had before  or has since   the dizzy work of building skyscrapers   in rasenberger s words  hine turned what might have been an assignment of  corporate flak  into  exhilarating these images were later organized into their own the steelworkers  sheer height enraptured onlookers  with new

when united states president herbert hoover turned on the building s lights with the push of a button from washington  the tower had been completed forty-five  days earlier than its projected jimmy walker  governor franklin d  roosevelt  and al smith were also in attendance  after the ceremonial button pressing  they and about 350  other guests proceeded to attend a luncheon on the 86th  an account from that day stated that the view from the luncheon was obscured by a fog  with other landmarks such as the statue of liberty being  lost in the the building officially opened the next advertisements for the observatories were placed in local newspapers  while nearby hotels also released ads that lauded their proximity to the newly opened and real estate speculators predicted that the 1,250-foot-tall  (380  m  empire state building would be the world s tallest building  for many years   thus ending the great new york city skyscraper rivalry  at the time  most engineers agreed that it would be much harder to build a building taller than 1,200  feet (370  m   even with the hardy manhattan  technically  it was possible to build a tower of up to 2,000  feet (610  m   but it was deemed uneconomical to do so  especially given the fact that the great depression was ongoing at the as the tallest building in the world and the first one to exceed 100  floors  the empire state building became an icon of the city  and ultimately  of the entire empire state building s opening coincided with the great depression in the united states  and as a result much of its office space was in the first year  23%  of the available space was by contrast  during the 1920s,  the average building would be 52%  rented upon opening and 90%  rented within five the lack of renters led new yorkers to deride the building as the  empty state brod  the building s longest-lasting  original co-established  the empire diamond corporation with his father in the building in and rented space in the building until he died in brod later recalled that there were only about 20  tenants at the time of opening  including and that al smith was the only real tenant in the space above his seventh-floor  generally  during the early 1930s,  it was rare for an entity to rent more than a single office in the building  despite smith s and raskob s aggressive marketing efforts in the newspapers and to anyone they the building s lights were continuously left on  even in the unrented spaces  to give the impression of occupancy  this was exacerbated by competition from the rockefeller as well as from buildings on 42nd  street  which  combined with the empire state building  provided excessive space in a slow marketing efforts served to reinforce the empire state building s status as the world s the observatory was advertised in local newspapers as well as on railroad the building became a popular tourist attraction  with one million people each paying one dollar to ride elevators to the observation decks in in its first year of operation  the observation deck took in approximately 2  million dollars  as much money as its owners made in rent that by 1936,  the top of the building was consistently crowded from sunset to midnight  with people heading to the top to eat leisurely $1.25  dinners with a  wide selection of long  chill nbc also took advantage of the building  leasing space on the 85th  floor for radio broadcasts from 1931  on the whole  however  the building was in debt from the outset  losing $1  million per year by 1935.  real estate developer seymour durst recalled that the building was so underused in 1936  that there was no elevator service above the 45th  floor  as the building above the 41st  floor was empty except for the nbc offices and the raskob du pont offices on the 81st  originally planned  the empire state building s spire was supposed to be used as an airship docking station  raskob and smith proposed dirigible ticketing offices and passenger waiting rooms on the 86th  floor  while the airships themselves would be tied to the spire at the equivalent of the building s 106th  an elevator between the 86th  and 101st  would carry passengers after they checked in on the 86th  with steep ladders leading to the airship s the idea was impractical and dangerous  due to the powerful updrafts caused by the building the wind currents across and the spires of nearby furthermore  even if the airship were to successfully navigate all these obstacles  its crew would have to jettison some ballast by releasing water onto the streets below in order to maintain stability  and then tie the craft s nose to the spire with no mooring lines tying the other end of the craft to the on september 15,  1931,  in the first and only instance of an airship using the building s mast  a small commercial united states navy airship circled 25  times in 45  miles per hour (72  km h  the airship then attempted to dock at the mast  but its ballast spilled and the craft itself was roiled by capricious the near-disaster  scuttled plans to make the building s spire into an airship terminal  although one blimp did manage to make a single newspaper delivery 1932,  the fifth avenue association gave the tower its 1931   gold medal  for architectural excellence  signifying that the empire state had been the best-designed  building on fifth avenue to open in a year later  on march 2,  1933,  the movie king kong was released  the movie  which depicted a large stop motion ape named kong climbing the empire state building  made the still-new  building into a cinematic save the building from bankruptcy  the management company of the building opened an observatory on the 86th  floor and allowed public access to a large terrace on the eighty-first  floor  a wedding chapel was also added to the building s 80th  floor  this made the tower one of the city s major tourist attractions  and during the first years of operation  revenues from tourism equaled the total amount of rent paid by all the tower received its 5  millionth tourist in july 28,  1945,  a b-25  mitchell bomber crashed into the north side of the empire state building  between the 79th  and 80th  one engine shot through the side opposite the impact and flew as far as the next block  while the other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft  fourteen people were killed in the however  the building was not severely damaged or structurally compromised  and it reopened two days empire state building only became profitable in the 1950s,  when it was finally able to break even for the first despite the lack of nearby transportation centers  the empire state building started to attract renters due to its a 222-foot  (68  m  radio antenna was erected on top of the tower starting in allowing the area s television stations to broadcast from the raskob felt that the tower had been unprofitable for too long  and he put the tower on sale in with a minimum asking price of $50  the property was purchased by business partners roger l  stevens  henry crown  alfred r  glancy and ben the sale was brokered by the charles f  noyes company  a prominent real estate firm in upper for $51  million  the highest price paid for a single structure at the by this time  the empire state had been fully leased  for several years   with a  waiting list  to lease space in the that year  six news companies started a combined $600,000  annually for use of the tower s the antenna was completed by crown bought out his partners  ownership stakes in 1954,  becoming the sole the next year  the american society of civil engineers named the building one of the  seven modern civil engineering

refurbishment and window-washing  in the installation of new flood lights on the 72nd  floor in and replacement of the manually operated elevators with automatic units in the little-used  western end of the second floor was used as a storage space until 1964,  at which point it received escalators to the first floor as part of its conversion into a highly-sought  retail 1961,  the same year that helmsley  wien  and malkin had purchased the empire state building  the port authority of new york and new jersey formally backed plans for a new world trade center in lower the plan originally included 66-story  twin towers with column-free  open spaces  the empire state s owners and real estate speculators were worried that the twin towers  7,600,000  square feet (710,000  m2)  of office space would create an excess of rentable space in manhattan as well as take away the empire state building s profits from a revision in the world trade center s plan brought the twin towers to 1,370  feet (420  m  each or 110  stories  taller than the empire opponents of the new project included prominent real-estate  developer robert tishman  as well as wien s committee for a reasonable world trade in response to wein s opposition  port authority executive director austin j  tobin said that wein was only opposing the project because it would overshadow his empire state building as the world s tallest world trade center s twin towers started construction in the next year  the ostankino tower succeeded the empire state building as the tallest freestanding structure in the the empire state also lost the title of world s tallest building in as the taller north tower surpassed the empire state s height on october 19  of that and topped out on december 23,  the twin towers opened their 110th-floor  observatory in december 1975,  which meant that the empire state building did not even have the tallest observatory in the city the empire state building also lost income during this time  as many of the broadcast stations moved to the world trade center in 1971,  although the port authority continued to pay the broadcasting leases for the empire state until 1980,  there were nearly two million annual although official estimates the previous year had placed the figure closer to between 1.5  million and 1.75  the building received its own zip code in may 1980  as part of the addition of 63  new postal codes in manhattan  at the time  the tower s tenants received a collective 35,000  pieces of mail every the empire state building celebrated its 50th  anniversary on may

for $42  million to a buyer representing hotelier hideki yokoi  who was at the time imprisoned in connection with a deadly fire at the hotel new japan hotel in the land was bought jointly by donald trump and hideki yokoi in having secured a half-ownership  of the land  trump devised plans to take ownership of the building itself so he could renovate it  even though helmsley and malkin had already started their refurbishment he sued empire state building associates in february 1995,  claiming that the latter had caused the building to become a "high-rise  and a "second-rate,  rodent-infested"  office trump had aimed to get empire state building associates evicted by breaking their but that action was and helmsley s companies sued trump in may of that this sparked a round of lawsuits and countersuits that lasted several which partially arose from trump s desire to obtain the building s master lease by taking it from empire state building upon harry helmsley s death in 1997,  the malkins sued helmsley s widow leona helmsley for ownership of the world trade center was destroyed in the september 11  attacks in 2001.  the empire state building again became the tallest building in new york city  but was now only the second-tallest  building in the americas  surpassed by the willis tower in because of the september 11  attacks  nearly all of the city s commercial television and fm radio broadcast stations started transmitting again from the top of the empire state in the aftermath of the attacks  security measures at the empire state building were also increased due to persistent terror threats against new york city 2002,  trump and yokoi sold their claim to the land to the empire state building associates  now headed by malkin in a $57.5  million this action merged the building s title and lease for the first time in a despite the lingering threat posed by the 9/11  attacks  the empire state building remained popular  with 3.5  million visitors to the observatories in 2004  compared to about 2.8  million in helmsley s remaining share in the building was bought by peter malkin s company in in 2008  the building was temporary “stolen” by the new york daily news to show how easy it is to transfer the deed on a property  since city clerks were not required to validate the submitted information  as well as to help demonstrate how fraudulent deeds could be used to obtain large mortgages and then have individuals disappear with the money  the paperwork submitted to the city included the names of fay wray  the famous star of king kong  and willie sutton  a notorious new york bank robber  the newspaper then transferred the deed back over to the legitimate owners  who at that time were empire state land building s public areas

complaints that a common location was necessary for the seven extant new york-area  television stations to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted

constructed ringing the 103rd  floor observation area to act as a master stations  placement in the empire state building became a major issue with the construction of the world trade center s twin towers during the late 1960s  and early 1970s.  as the towers were taller than the empire state building  this would cause waves from the empire state building to sometimes bounce off the walls of the taller twin towers  as a result  some broadcasters decided that it would be easier to move to the twin towers instead  rather than suing the complex s developer  the port authority of new york and new jersey  to stop even though the nine stations who were broadcasting from the empire state building were leasing their broadcast space until 1984,  most of these stations moved to the world trade center as soon as it was completed in 1971.  the broadcasters obtained a court order stipulating that the port authority had to build a mast and transmission equipment in the north tower  as well as pay the broadcasters  leases in the empire state building until after the leases expired  there were very few broadcasters remaining in the empire state september 11  attacks in 2001  destroyed the world trade center and the broadcast centers atop it  leaving most of the city s stations without a station for ten days until a temporary tower was built in alpine  new by october 2001,  nearly all of the city s commercial broadcast stations  both television and fm radio  were transmitting from the top of the empire state building  the stations  placement in the empire state building was considered  problematic  due to interference from other nearby towers  as contrasted with the former twin towers  which had very few buildings of comparable height in 2003,  a few fm stations were relocated to the nearby condé nast building to reduce the number of broadcast stations using the empire state eleven television stations and 22  fm stations had signed 15-year  leases in the building
