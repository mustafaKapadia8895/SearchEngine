 antarctic bottom water -  wikipediathe antarctic bottom water  aabw  is a type of water mass in the southern ocean surrounding antarctica with temperatures ranging from −0.8  to 2  °c (35  °f   salinities from 34.6  to 34.7  psu  being the densest water mass of the oceans  aabw is found to occupy the depth range below 4000  m of all ocean basins that have a connection to the southern ocean at that the major significance of antarctic bottom water is that it is the coldest bottom water  giving it a significant influence on the movement of the world s oceans  antarctic bottom water also has a high oxygen content relative to the rest of the oceans  deep waters  this is due to the oxidation of deteriorating organic content in the rest of the deep oceans  antarctic bottom water has thus been considered the ventilation of the deep needed antarctic bottom water is created in part due to the major overturning of ocean water antarctic bottom water is formed in the weddell and ross seas  off the adélie coast and by cape darnley from surface water cooling in polynyas and below the ice a unique feature of antarctic bottom water is the cold surface wind blowing off the antarctic the surface wind creates the polynyas which opens up the water surface to more wind  this antarctic wind is stronger during the winter months and thus the antarctic bottom water formation is more pronounced during the antarctic winter season  surface water is enriched in salt from sea ice formation  due to its increased density  it flows down the antarctic continental margin and continues north along the bottom  it is the densest water in the free ocean  and underlies other bottom and intermediate waters throughout most of the southern hemisphere  the weddell sea bottom water is the densest component of the antarctic bottom water evidence indicates that antarctic bottom water production through the holocene  last 10,000  years  is not in a steady-state  that is to say that bottom water production sites shift along the antarctic margin over decade to century timescales as conditions for the existence of polynyas change  for example  the calving of the mertz glacier  which occurred on 12–13  february 2010,  dramatically changed the environment for producing bottom water  reducing export by up to 23%  in the region of adelie evidence from sediment cores  containing layers of cross-bedded  sediments indicating phases of stronger bottom currents  collected on the mac robertson shelf and adélie suggests that they have switched  on  and  off  again as important bottom water production sites over the last several thousand years the vema channel  a deep trough in the rio grande rise of the south atlantic at 31°18′s  39°24′w﻿    ﻿31.3°s  39.4°w﻿    -31.3;  -39.4,  is an important conduit for antarctic bottom water and weddell sea bottom water migrating upon reaching the equator  about one-third  of the northward flowing antarctic bottom water enters the guiana basin  mainly through the southern half of the equatorial channel at 35°w.  the other part recirculates and some of it flows through the romanche fracture zone into the eastern atlantic  in the guiana basin  west of 40°w,  the sloping topography and the strong  eastward flowing deep western boundary current might prevent the antarctic bottom water from flowing west  thus it has to turn north at the eastern slope of the ceará rise  at 44°w,  north of the ceará rise  antarctic bottom water flows west in the interior of the basin  a large fraction of the antarctic bottom water enters the eastern atlantic through the vema fracture the indian ocean the crozet-kerguelen  gap allows antarctic bottom water to move toward the equator  this northward movement amounts to 2.5  sv  it takes the antarctic bottom water 23  years to reach the crozet-kerguelen  south of africa  antarctic bottom water flow northwards through the agulhas basin and then east through the agulhas passage and over the southern margins of the agulhas plateau from where it is transported to into the mozambique
