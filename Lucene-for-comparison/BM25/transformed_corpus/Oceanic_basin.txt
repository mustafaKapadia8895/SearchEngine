 oceanic basin -  wikipediain hydrology  an oceanic basin may be anywhere on earth that is covered by seawater  but geologically ocean basins are large geologic basins that are below sea level  geologically  there are other undersea geomorphological features such as the continental shelves  the deep ocean trenches  and the undersea mountain ranges  for example  the mid-atlantic  ridge and the emperor seamounts  which are not considered to be part of the ocean basins  while hydrologically  oceanic basins include the flanking continental shelves and shallow  epeiric seas older references  e g   littlehales consider the oceanic basins to be the complement to the continents  with erosion dominating the latter  and the sediments so derived ending up in the ocean basins  more modern sources  e g   floyd regard the ocean basins more as basaltic plains  than as sedimentary depositories  since most sedimentation occurs on the continental shelves and not in the geologically-defined  ocean some geologic basins are both above and below sea level  such as the maracaibo basin in venezuela  although geologically it is not considered an oceanic basin because it is on the continental shelf and underlain by continental crust earth is the only known planet in the solar system where hypsography is characterized by different kinds of crust  oceanic crust and continental oceans cover 70%  of the earth s surface  because oceans lie lower than continents  the former serve as sedimentary basins that collect sediment eroded from the continents  known as clastic sediments  as well as precipitation sediments  ocean basins also serve as repositories for the skeletons of carbonate-  and silica-secreting  organisms such as coral reefs  diatoms  radiolarians  and foraminifera geologically  an oceanic basin may be actively changing size or may be relatively  tectonically inactive  depending on whether there is a moving plate tectonic boundary associated with it  the elements of an active -  and growing -  oceanic basin include an elevated mid-ocean  ridge  flanking abyssal hills leading down to abyssal plains  the elements of an active oceanic basin often include the oceanic trench associated with a subduction zone the atlantic ocean and the arctic ocean are good examples of active  growing oceanic basins  whereas the mediterranean sea is shrinking  the pacific ocean is also an active  shrinking oceanic basin  even though it has both spreading ridge and oceanic trenches  perhaps the best example of an inactive oceanic basin is the gulf of mexico  which formed in jurassic times and has been doing nothing but collecting sediments since the aleutian is another example of a relatively inactive oceanic basin  the japan basin in the sea of japan which formed in the miocene  is still tectonically active although recent changes have been relatively
