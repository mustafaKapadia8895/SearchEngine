 human evolution -  wikipediahuman evolution  also known as hominization  is the evolutionary process that led to the emergence of anatomically modern humans  beginning with the evolutionary history of primates – in particular genus homo – and leading to the emergence of homo sapiens as a distinct species of the hominid family  the great apes  this process involved the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism and study of human evolution involves many scientific disciplines  including physical anthropology  primatology  archaeology  paleontology  neurobiology  ethology  linguistics  evolutionary psychology  embryology and genetic studies show that primates diverged from other mammals about 85  million years ago  in the late cretaceous period  and the earliest fossils appear in the paleocene  around 55  million years the hominoidea  apes  superfamily  the hominidae family diverged from the hylobatidae  gibbon  family some 15–20  million years ago  african great apes  subfamily homininae  diverged from orangutans  ponginae  about 14  million years ago  the hominini tribe  humans  australopithecines and other extinct biped genera  and chimpanzee  parted from the gorillini tribe  gorillas  between 9  million years ago and 8  million years ago  and  in turn  the subtribes hominina  humans and biped ancestors  and panina  chimps  separated about 7.5  million years ago to 5.6  million years evolution from its first separation from the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees is characterized by a number of morphological  developmental  physiological  and behavioral changes  the most significant of these adaptations are bipedalism  increased brain size  lengthened ontogeny  gestation and infancy   and decreased sexual dimorphism  the relationship between these changes is the subject of ongoing needed  other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a power and precision grip  a change first occurring in h  is the basic adaptation of the hominid and is considered the main cause behind a suite of skeletal changes shared by all bipedal hominids  the earliest hominin  of presumably primitive bipedalism  is considered to be either or orrorin  both of which arose some 6  to 7  million years ago  the non-bipedal  knuckle-walkers,  the gorilla and chimpanzee  diverged from the hominin line over a period covering the same time  so either of sahelanthropus or orrorin may be our last shared ancestor  ardipithecus  a full biped  arose somewhat needed the early bipeds eventually evolved into the australopithecines and still later into the genus homo  there are several theories of the adaptation value of bipedalism  it is possible that bipedalism was favored because it freed the hands for reaching and carrying food  saved energy during enabled long distance running and hunting  provided an enhanced field of vision  and helped avoid hyperthermia by reducing the surface area exposed to direct sun  features all advantageous for thriving in the new savanna and woodland environment created as a result of the east african rift valley uplift versus the previous closed forest a new study provides support for the hypothesis that walking on two legs  or bipedalism  evolved because it used less energy than quadrupedal however  recent studies suggest that bipedality without the ability to use fire would not have allowed global this change in gait saw a lengthening of the legs proportionately when compared to the length of the arms  which were shortened through the removal of the need for brachiation  another change is the shape of the big toe  recent studies suggest that australopithecines still lived part of the time in trees as a result of maintaining a grasping big toe  this was progressively lost in habilines anatomically  the evolution of bipedalism has been accompanied by a large number of skeletal changes  not just to the legs and pelvis  but also to the vertebral column  feet and ankles  and the femur evolved into a slightly more angular position to move the center of gravity toward the geometric center of the body  the knee and ankle joints became increasingly robust to better support increased weight  to support the increased weight on each vertebra in the upright position  the human vertebral column became s-shaped  and the lumbar vertebrae became shorter and wider  in the feet the big toe moved into alignment with the other toes to help in forward locomotion  the arms and forearms shortened relative to the legs making it easier to run  the foramen magnum migrated under the skull and more most significant changes occurred in the pelvic region  where the long downward facing iliac blade was shortened and widened as a requirement for keeping the center of gravity stable while bipedal hominids have a shorter but broader  bowl-like  pelvis due to this  a drawback is that the birth canal of bipedal apes is smaller than in knuckle-walking  apes  though there has been a widening of it in comparison to that of australopithecine and modern humans  permitting the passage of newborns due to the increase in cranial size but this is limited to the upper portion  since further increase can hinder normal bipedal shortening of the pelvis and smaller birth canal evolved as a requirement for bipedalism and had significant effects on the process of human birth which is much more difficult in modern humans than in other primates  during human birth  because of the variation in size of the pelvic region  the fetal head must be in a transverse position  compared to the mother  during entry into the birth canal and rotate about 90  degrees upon the smaller birth canal became a limiting factor to brain size increases in early humans and prompted a shorter gestation period leading to the relative immaturity of human offspring  who are unable to walk much before 12  months and have greater neoteny  compared to other primates  who are mobile at a much earlier the increased brain growth after birth and the increased dependency of children on mothers had a big effect upon the female reproductive and the more frequent appearance of alloparenting in humans when compared with other delayed human sexual maturity also led to the evolution of menopause with one explanation providing that elderly women could better pass on their genes by taking care of their daughter s offspring  as compared to having more children of their human species eventually developed a much larger brain than that of other primates—typically 1,330  cm3  (81  cu in  in modern humans  nearly three times the size of that of a chimpanzee or the pattern of encephalization started with homo habilis  after a hiatus with australopithecus anamensis and ardipithecus species which had smaller brains as a result of their bipedal which at approximately 600  cm3  (37  cu in  homo habilis had a brain slightly larger than that of chimpanzees  and this evolution continued with homo erectus (800–1,100  cm3  (49–67  cu in    reaching a maximum in neanderthals (1,200–1,900  cm3  (73–116  cu in    larger even than modern homo sapiens  this pattern of brain increase happened through the pattern of human postnatal brain growth which differs from that of other apes  heterochrony   it also allows for extended periods of social learning and language acquisition in juvenile humans which may have begun 2  million years ago  however  the differences between the structure of human brains and those of other apes may be even more significant than differences in increase in volume over time has affected areas within the brain unequally—the temporal lobes  which contain centers for language processing  have increased disproportionately  and seems to favor a belief that there was evolution after leaving africa  as has the prefrontal cortex which has been related to complex decision-making  and moderating social encephalization has been tied to an increasing emphasis on meat in the or with the development of and it has been proposed that intelligence increased as a response to an increased necessity for solving social problems as human society became more the human brain was able to expand because of the changes in the morphology of smaller mandibles and mandible muscle attachments to the skull into allowing more room for the brain to increase in volume of the neocortex also included a rapid increase in size of the cerebellum  traditionally the cerebellum has been associated with a paleocerebellum and archicerebellum as well as a neocerebellum  its function has also traditionally been associated with balance  fine motor control but more recently speech and cognition  the great apes including humans and its antecessors had a more pronounced development of the cerebellum relative to the neocortex than other primates  it has been suggested that because of its function of sensory-motor  control and assisting in learning complex muscular action sequences  the cerebellum may have underpinned the evolution of human s technological adaptations including the preadaptation of reason for this encephalization is difficult to discern  as the major changes from homo erectus to homo heidelbergensis were not associated with major changes in technology  it has been suggested that the changes have been associated with social changes  increased empathic and increases in size of social reduced degree of sexual dimorphism is visible primarily in the reduction of the male canine tooth relative to other ape species  except gibbons  and reduced brow ridges and general robustness of males  another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of hidden estrus  humans and bonobos are the only apes in which the female is fertile year round and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body  such as genital swelling during estrus  nonetheless  humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat  and in the overall size  males being around 15%  larger than females  these changes taken together have been interpreted as a result of an increased emphasis on pair bonding as a possible solution to the requirement for increased parental investment due to the prolonged infancy of offspring the ulnar opposition – the contact between the thumb and the tip of the little finger of the same hand – is unique to anatomically modern in other primates the thumb is short and unable to touch the little the ulnar opposition facilitates the precision grip and power grip of the human hand  underlying all the skilled manipulations a number of other changes have also characterized the evolution of humans  among them an increased importance on vision rather than smell  a smaller gut  loss of body hair  evolution of sweat glands  a change in the shape of the dental arcade from being u-shaped  to being parabolic  development of a chin  found in homo sapiens alone   development of styloid processes  and the development of a descended larynx the word homo  the name of the biological genus to which humans belong  is latin for  human   it was chosen originally by carl linnaeus in his classification system  the word  human  is from the latin humanus  the adjectival form of homo  the latin  homo  derives from the indo-european  root  dhghem  or linnaeus and other scientists of his time also considered the great apes to be the closest relatives of humans based on morphological and anatomical similarities the possibility of linking humans with earlier apes by descent became clear only after 1859  with the publication of charles darwin s on the origin of species  in which he argued for the idea of the evolution of new species from earlier ones  darwin s book did not address the question of human evolution  saying only that  light will be thrown on the origin of man and his first debates about the nature of human evolution arose between thomas henry huxley and richard owen  huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes  and did so particularly in his 1863  book evidence as to man s place in nature  however  many of darwin s early supporters  such as alfred russel wallace and charles lyell  did not initially agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by natural selection  though this later changed  darwin applied the theory of evolution and sexual selection to humans when he published the descent of man in major problem at that time was the lack of fossil intermediaries  neanderthal remains were discovered in a limestone quarry in 1856,  three years before the publication of on the origin of species  and neanderthal fossils had been discovered in gibraltar even earlier  but it was originally claimed that these were human remains of a creature suffering some kind of despite the 1891  discovery by eugène dubois of what is now called homo erectus at trinil  java  it was only in the 1920s  when such fossils were discovered in africa  that intermediate species began to needed  in 1925,  raymond dart described australopithecus the type specimen was the taung child  an australopithecine infant which was discovered in a cave  the child s remains were a remarkably well-preserved  tiny skull and an endocast of the brain although the brain was small (410  cm3),  its shape was rounded  unlike that of chimpanzees and gorillas  and more like a modern human brain  also  the specimen showed short canine teeth  and the position of the foramen magnum  the hole in the skull where the spine enters  was evidence of bipedal locomotion  all of these traits convinced dart that the taung child was a bipedal human ancestor  a transitional form between apes and humans during the 1960s  and 1970s,  hundreds of fossils were found in east africa in the regions of the olduvai gorge and lake turkana  the driving force of these searches was the leakey family  with louis leakey and his wife mary leakey  and later their son richard and daughter-in-law  meave—all successful and world-renowned  fossil hunters and paleoanthropologists  from the fossil beds of olduvai and lake turkana they amassed specimens of the early hominins  the australopithecines and homo species  and even homo erectus these finds cemented africa as the cradle of humankind  in the late 1970s  and the 1980s,  ethiopia emerged as the new hot spot of paleoanthropology after  lucy   the most complete fossil member of the species australopithecus afarensis  was found in 1974  by donald johanson near hadar in the desertic afar triangle region of northern ethiopia  although the specimen had a small brain  the pelvis and leg bones were almost identical in function to those of modern humans  showing with certainty that these hominins had walked lucy was classified as a new species  australopithecus afarensis  which is thought to be more closely related to the genus homo as a direct ancestor  or as a close relative of an unknown ancestor  than any other known hominid or hominin from this early time range  see terms  hominid  and  the specimen was nicknamed  lucy  after the beatles  song  lucy in the sky with diamonds   which was played loudly and repeatedly in the camp during the the afar triangle area would later yield discovery of many more hominin fossils  particularly those uncovered or described by teams headed by tim d  white in the 1990s,  including ardipithecus ramidus and ardipithecus 2013,  fossil skeletons of homo naledi  an extinct species of hominin assigned  provisionally  to the genus homo  were found in the rising star cave system  a site in south africa s cradle of humankind region in gauteng province near as of september fossils of at least fifteen individuals  amounting to 1550  specimens  have been excavated from the the species is characterized by a body mass and stature similar to small-bodied  human populations  a smaller endocranial volume similar to australopithecus  and a cranial morphology  skull shape  similar to early homo species  the skeletal anatomy combines primitive features known from australopithecines with features known from early hominins  the individuals show signs of having been deliberately disposed of within the cave near the time of death  the fossils have not yet been genetic revolution in studies of human evolution started when vincent sarich and allan wilson measured the strength of immunological cross-reactions  of blood serum albumin between pairs of creatures  including humans and african apes  chimpanzees and the strength of the reaction could be expressed numerically as an immunological distance  which was in turn proportional to the number of amino acid differences between homologous proteins in different species  by constructing a calibration curve of the id of species  pairs with known divergence times in the fossil record  the data could be used as a molecular clock to estimate the times of divergence of pairs with poorer or unknown fossil records in their seminal 1967  paper in science  sarich and wilson estimated the divergence time of humans and apes as four to five million years at a time when standard interpretations of the fossil record gave this divergence as at least 10  to as much as 30  million years  subsequent fossil discoveries  notably  lucy   and reinterpretation of older fossil materials  notably ramapithecus  showed the younger estimates to be correct and validated the albumin method progress in dna sequencing  specifically mitochondrial dna  mtdna  and then y-chromosome  dna (y-dna)  advanced the understanding of human application of the molecular clock principle revolutionized the study of molecular evolution on the basis of a separation from the orangutan between 10  and 20  million years ago  earlier studies of the molecular clock suggested that there were about 76  mutations per generation that were not inherited by human children from their parents  this evidence supported the divergence time between hominins and chimps noted above  however  a 2012  study in iceland of 78  children and their parents suggests a mutation rate of only 36  mutations per generation  this datum extends the separation between humans and chimps to an earlier period greater than 7  million years ago  ma   additional research with 226  offspring of wild chimp populations in 8  locations suggests that chimps reproduce at age 26.5  years  on average  which suggests the human divergence from chimps occurred between 7  and 13  million years ago  and these data suggest that ardipithecus (4.5  ma   orrorin (6  ma  and sahelanthropus (7  ma  all may be on the hominid lineage  and even that the separation may have occurred outside the east african rift region furthermore  analysis of the two species  genes in 2006  provides evidence that after human ancestors had started to diverge from chimpanzees  interspecies mating between "proto-human"  and "proto-chimps"  nonetheless occurred regularly enough to change certain genes in the new gene pool the research suggests in the 1990s,  several teams of paleoanthropologists were working throughout africa looking for evidence of the earliest divergence of the hominin lineage from the great apes  in 1994,  meave leakey discovered australopithecus anamensis  the find was overshadowed by tim d  white s 1995  discovery of ardipithecus ramidus  which pushed back the fossil record to 4.2  million years ago in 2000,  martin pickford and brigitte senut discovered  in the tugen hills of kenya  a 6-million-year-old  bipedal hominin which they named orrorin tugenensis  and in 2001,  a team led by michel brunet discovered the skull of sahelanthropus tchadensis which was dated as 7.2  million years ago  and which brunet argued was a bipedal  and therefore a hominid—that is  a hominin  cf hominidae  terms  hominids  and hominins  anthropologists in the 1980s  were divided regarding some details of reproductive barriers and migratory dispersals of the homo genus  subsequently  genetics has been used to investigate and resolve these issues  according to the sahara pump theory evidence suggests that genus homo have migrated out of africa at least three and possibly four times  e g  homo erectus  homo heidelbergensis and two or three times for homo sapiens   recent evidence suggests these dispersals are closely related to fluctuating periods of climate evidence suggests that humans may have left africa half a million years earlier than previously thought  a joint franco-indian  team has found human artefacts in the siwalk hills north of new delhi dating back at least 2.6  million years  this is earlier than the previous earliest finding of genus homo at dmanisi  in georgia  dating to 1.85  million years  although controversial  tools found at a chinese cave strengthen the case that humans used tools as far back as 2.48  million years this suggests that the asian  chopper  tool tradition  found in java and northern china may have left africa before the appearance of the acheulian hand axe up until the genetic evidence became available there were two dominant models for the dispersal of modern humans  the multiregional hypothesis proposed that homo genus contained only a single interconnected population as it does today  not separate species   and that its evolution took place worldwide continuously over the last couple million years  this model was proposed in 1988  by milford h  in contrast the  out of africa  model proposed that modern h  sapiens speciated in africa recently  that is  approximately 200,000  years ago  and the subsequent migration through eurasia resulted in nearly complete replacement of other homo species  this model has been developed by chris b  stringer and peter mtdna and y-dna  sampled from a wide range of indigenous populations revealed ancestral information relating to both male and female genetic heritage  and strengthened the out of africa theory and weakened the views of multiregional aligned in genetic tree differences were interpreted as supportive of a recent single analyses have shown a greater diversity of dna patterns throughout africa  consistent with the idea that africa is the ancestral home of mitochondrial eve and y-chromosomal  adam  and that modern human dispersal out of africa has only occurred over the last 55,000  of africa  has thus gained much support from research using female mitochondrial dna and the male y chromosome  after analysing genealogy trees constructed using 133  types of mtdna  researchers concluded that all were descended from a female african progenitor  dubbed mitochondrial eve   out of africa  is also supported by the fact that mitochondrial genetic diversity is highest among african broad study of african genetic diversity  headed by sarah tishkoff  found the san people had the greatest genetic diversity among the 113  distinct populations sampled  making them one of 14   ancestral population clusters   the research also located a possible origin of modern human migration in south-western  africa  near the coastal border of namibia and the fossil evidence was insufficient for archaeologist richard leakey to resolve the debate about exactly where in africa modern humans first studies of haplogroups in y-chromosomal  dna and mitochondrial dna have largely supported a recent african all the evidence from autosomal dna also predominantly supports a recent african origin  however  evidence for archaic admixture in modern humans  both in africa and later  throughout eurasia has recently been suggested by a number of sequencing of and genomes shows that some admixture with these populations has occurred  modern humans outside africa have 2–4%  neanderthal alleles in their genome  and some melanesians have an additional 4–6%  of denisovan alleles  these new results do not contradict the  out of africa  model  except in its strictest interpretation  although they make the situation more complex  after recovery from a genetic bottleneck that could possibly be due to the toba supervolcano catastrophe  a fairly small group left africa and later briefly interbred on three separate occasions with neanderthals  probably in the middle-east,  on the eurasian steppe or even in north africa before their departure  their still predominantly african descendants spread to populate the world  a fraction in turn interbred with denisovans  probably in south-east  asia  before populating hla haplotypes of neanderthal and denisova origin have been identified in modern eurasian and oceanian the denisovan epas1  gene has also been found in tibetan are still differing theories on whether there was a single exodus from africa or several  a multiple dispersal model involves the southern dispersal which has gained support in recent years from genetic  linguistic and archaeological evidence  in this theory  there was a coastal dispersal of modern humans from the horn of africa crossing the bab el mandib to yemen at a lower sea level around 70,000  years ago  this group helped to populate southeast asia and oceania  explaining the discovery of early human sites in these areas much earlier than those in the this group seems to have been dependent upon marine resources for their survival stephen oppenheimer has proposed a second wave of humans may have later dispersed through the persian gulf oases  and the zagros mountains into the middle east  alternatively it may have come across the sinai peninsula into asia  from shortly after 50,000  yrs bp  resulting in the bulk of the human populations of eurasia  it has been suggested that this second group possibly possessed a more sophisticated  big game hunting  tool technology and was less dependent on coastal food sources than the original group  much of the evidence for the first group s expansion would have been destroyed by the rising sea levels at the end of each glacial the multiple dispersal model is contradicted by studies indicating that the populations of eurasia and the populations of southeast asia and oceania are all descended from the same mitochondrial dna l3  lineages  which support a single migration out of africa that gave rise to all non-african  oppenheimer  on the basis of the early date of badoshan iranian aurignacian  suggests that this second dispersal  may have occurred with a pluvial period about 50,000  years before the present  with modern human big-game  hunting cultures spreading up the zagros mountains  carrying modern human genomes from oman  throughout the persian gulf  northward into armenia and anatolia  with a variant travelling south into israel and to evidence on which scientific accounts of human evolution are based comes from many fields of natural science  the main source of knowledge about the evolutionary process has traditionally been the fossil record  but since the development of genetics beginning in the 1970s,  dna analysis has come to occupy a place of comparable importance  the studies of ontogeny  phylogeny and especially evolutionary developmental biology of both vertebrates and invertebrates offer considerable insight into the evolution of all life  including how humans evolved  the specific study of the origin and life of humans is anthropology  particularly paleoanthropology which focuses on the study of human closest living relatives of humans are bonobos and chimpanzees  both genus pan  and gorillas  genus with the sequencing of both the human and chimpanzee genome  as of 2012  estimates of the similarity between their dna sequences range between 95%  and by using the technique called the molecular clock which estimates the time required for the number of divergent mutations to accumulate between two lineages  the approximate date for the split between lineages can be calculated the gibbons  family hylobatidae  and then orangutans  genus pongo  were the first groups to split from the line leading to the hominins  including humans—followed by gorillas  and  ultimately  by the chimpanzees  genus pan   the splitting date between hominin and chimpanzee lineages is placed by some between 4  to 8  million years ago  that is  during the late speciation  however  appears to have been unusually drawn-out.  initial divergence occurred sometime between 7  to 13  million years ago  but ongoing hybridization blurred the separation and delayed complete separation during several millions of years  patterson (2006)  dated the final divergence at 5  to 6  million years evidence has also been employed to resolve the question of whether there was any gene flow between early modern humans and neanderthals  and to enhance our understanding of the early human migration patterns and splitting dates  by comparing the parts of the genome that are not under natural selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly steady rate  it is possible to reconstruct a genetic tree incorporating the entire human species since the last shared ancestor each time a certain mutation (single-nucleotide  polymorphism  appears in an individual and is passed on to his or her descendants a haplogroup is formed including all of the descendants of the individual who will also carry that mutation  by comparing mitochondrial dna which is inherited only from the mother  geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans  the so-called  mitochondrial eve  must have lived around 200,000  years ago human evolutionary genetics studies how one human genome differs from the other  the evolutionary past that gave rise to it  and its current effects  differences between genomes have anthropological  medical and forensic implications and applications  genetic data can provide important insight into human evolution there is little fossil evidence for the divergence of the gorilla  chimpanzee and hominin the earliest fossils that have been proposed as members of the hominin lineage are sahelanthropus tchadensis dating from 7  million years ago  orrorin tugenensis dating from 5.7  million years ago  and ardipithecus kadabba dating to 5.6  million years ago  each of these have been argued to be a bipedal ancestor of later hominins but  in each case  the claims have been contested  it is also possible that one or more of these species are ancestors of another branch of african apes  or that they represent a shared ancestor between hominins and other apes the question then of the relationship between these early fossil species and the hominin lineage is still to be resolved  from these early species  the australopithecines arose around 4  million years ago and diverged into robust  also called paranthropus  and gracile branches  one of which  possibly a  garhi  probably went on to become ancestors of the genus homo  the australopithecine species that is best represented in the fossil record is australopithecus afarensis with more than one hundred fossil individuals represented  found from northern ethiopia  such as the famous  lucy    to kenya  and south africa  fossils of robust australopithecines such as au  robustus  or alternatively paranthropus robustus  and au  p  boisei are particularly abundant in south africa at sites such as kromdraai and swartkrans  and around lake turkana in kenya the earliest member of the genus homo is homo habilis which evolved around 2.8  million years homo habilis is the first species for which we have positive evidence of the use of stone tools  they developed the oldowan lithic technology  named after the olduvai gorge in which the first specimens were found  some scientists consider homo rudolfensis  a larger bodied group of fossils with similar morphology to the original h  habilis fossils  to be a separate species while others consider them to be part of h  habilis—simply representing intraspecies variation  or perhaps even sexual dimorphism  the brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee  and their main adaptation was bipedalism as an adaptation to terrestrial living during the next million years  a process of encephalization began and  by the arrival  about 1.9  million years ago  of homo erectus in the fossil record  cranial capacity had doubled  homo erectus were the first of the hominins to emigrate from africa  and  from 1.8  to 1.3  million years ago  this species spread through africa  asia  and europe  one population of h  erectus  also sometimes classified as a separate species homo ergaster  remained in africa and evolved into homo sapiens  it is believed that these species  h  erectus and h  ergaster  were the first to use fire and complex tools the earliest transitional fossils between h  ergaster erectus and archaic h  sapiens are from africa  such as homo rhodesiensis  but seemingly transitional forms were also found at dmanisi  georgia  these descendants of african h  erectus spread through eurasia from ca  500,000  years ago evolving into h  antecessor  h  heidelbergensis and h  neanderthalensis  the earliest fossils of anatomically modern humans are from the middle paleolithic  about 200,000  years ago such as the omo remains of ethiopia  later fossils from es skhul cave in israel and southern europe begin around 90,000  years ago (0.09  million years ago  as modern humans spread out from africa  they encountered other hominins such as homo neanderthalensis and the so-called  denisovans  who may have evolved from populations of homo erectus that had left africa around 2  million years ago  the nature of interaction between early humans and these sister species has been a long-standing  source of controversy  the question being whether humans replaced these earlier species or whether they were in fact similar enough to interbreed  in which case these earlier populations may have contributed genetic material to modern migration out of africa is estimated to have begun about 70,000  years bp and modern humans subsequently spread globally  replacing earlier hominins either through competition or hybridization  they inhabited eurasia and oceania by 40,000  years bp  and the americas by at least 14,500  years history of the primates can be traced back 65  million one of the oldest known primate-like  mammal species  the plesiadapis  came from north another  archicebus  came from other similar basal primates were widespread in eurasia and africa during the tropical conditions of the paleocene and eocene david r  begun concluded that early primates flourished in eurasia and that a lineage leading to the african apes and humans  including to dryopithecus  migrated south from europe or western asia into africa  the surviving tropical population of primates—which is seen most completely in the upper eocene and lowermost oligocene fossil beds of the faiyum depression southwest of cairo—gave rise to all extant primate species  including the lemurs of madagascar  lorises of southeast asia  galagos or  bush babies  of africa  and to the anthropoids  which are the platyrrhines or new world monkeys  the catarrhines or old world monkeys  and the great apes  including humans and other hominids the earliest known catarrhine is kamoyapithecus from uppermost oligocene at eragaleit in the northern great rift valley in kenya  dated to 24  million years its ancestry is thought to be species related to aegyptopithecus  propliopithecus  and parapithecus from the faiyum  at around 35  million years in 2010,  saadanius was described as a close relative of the last common ancestor of the crown catarrhines  and tentatively dated to 29–28  million years ago  helping to fill an 11-million-year  gap in the fossil the early miocene  about 22  million years ago  the many kinds of arboreally adapted primitive catarrhines from east africa suggest a long history of prior diversification  fossils at 20  million years ago include fragments attributed to victoriapithecus  the earliest old world monkey  among the genera thought to be in the ape lineage leading up to 13  million years ago are proconsul  rangwapithecus  dendropithecus  limnopithecus  nacholapithecus  equatorius  nyanzapithecus  afropithecus  heliopithecus  and kenyapithecus  all from east africa the presence of other generalized non-cercopithecids  of middle miocene from sites far distant—otavipithecus from cave deposits in namibia  and pierolapithecus and dryopithecus from france  spain and austria—is evidence of a wide diversity of forms across africa and the mediterranean basin during the relatively warm and equable climatic regimes of the early and middle miocene  the youngest of the miocene hominoids  oreopithecus  is from coal beds in italy that have been dated to 9  million years ago molecular evidence indicates that the lineage of gibbons  family hylobatidae  diverged from the line of great apes some 18–12  million years ago  and that of orangutans  subfamily ponginae  diverged from the other great apes at about 12  million years  there are no fossils that clearly document the ancestry of gibbons  which may have originated in a so-far-unknown  south east asian hominoid population  but fossil proto-orangutans  may be represented by sivapithecus from india and griphopithecus from turkey  dated to around 10  million years close to the last common ancestor of gorillas  chimpanzees and humans may be represented by nakalipithecus fossils found in kenya and ouranopithecus found in greece  molecular evidence suggests that between 8  and 4  million years ago  first the gorillas  and then the chimpanzees  genus pan  split off from the line leading to the humans  human dna is approximately 98.4%  identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms  see human evolutionary genetics   the fossil record  however  of gorillas and chimpanzees is limited  both poor preservation—rain forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone—and sampling bias probably contribute to this problem other hominins probably adapted to the drier environments outside the equatorial belt  and there they encountered antelope  hyenas  dogs  pigs  elephants  horses  and others  the equatorial belt contracted after about 8  million years ago  and there is very little fossil evidence for the split—thought to have occurred around that time—of the hominin lineage from the lineages of gorillas and chimpanzees  the earliest fossils argued by some to belong to the human lineage are sahelanthropus tchadensis (7  ma  and orrorin tugenensis (6  ma   followed by ardipithecus (5.5–4.4  ma   with species ar  kadabba and ar  ramidus it has been argued in a study of the life history of ar  ramidus that the species provides evidence for a suite of anatomical and behavioral adaptations in very early hominins unlike any species of extant great this study demonstrated affinities between the skull morphology of ar  ramidus and that of infant and juvenile chimpanzees  suggesting the species evolved a juvenalised or paedomorphic craniofacial morphology via heterochronic dissociation of growth trajectories  it was also argued that the species provides support for the notion that very early hominins  akin to bonobos  pan paniscus  the less aggressive species of chimpanzee  may have evolved via the process of self-domestication.  consequently  arguing against the so-called   chimpanzee referential the authors suggest it is no longer tenable to use common chimpanzee  pan troglodytes  social and mating behaviors in models of early hominin social evolution  when commenting on the absence of aggressive canine morphology in ar  ramidus and the implications this has for the evolution of hominin social psychology  they wrote of course ar  ramidus differs significantly from bonobos  bonobos having retained a functional canine honing complex  however  the fact that ar  ramidus shares with bonobos reduced sexual dimorphism  and a more paedomorphic form relative to chimpanzees  suggests that the developmental and social adaptations evident in bonobos may be of assistance in future reconstructions of early hominin social and sexual psychology  in fact the trend towards increased maternal care  female mate selection and self-domestication  may have been stronger and more refined in ar  ramidus than what we see in authors argue that many of the basic human adaptations evolved in the ancient forest and woodland ecosystems of late miocene and early pliocene africa  consequently  they argue that humans may not represent evolution from a chimpanzee-like  ancestor as has traditionally been supposed  this suggests many modern human adaptations represent phylogenetically deep traits and that the behavior and morphology of chimpanzees may have evolved subsequent to the split with the common ancestor they share with humans the australopithecus genus evolved in eastern africa around 4  million years ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming extinct 2  million years ago  during this time period various forms of australopiths existed  including australopithecus anamensis  au  afarensis  au  sediba  and au  africanus  there is still some debate among academics whether certain african hominid species of this time  such as au  robustus and au  boisei  constitute members of the same genus  if so  they would be considered to be au  robust australopiths whilst the others would be considered au  gracile australopiths  however  if these species do indeed constitute their own genus  then they may be given their own name  the paranthropus a new proposed species australopithecus deyiremeda is claimed to have been discovered living at the same time period of au  afarensis  there is debate if au  deyiremeda is a new species or is au  australopithecus prometheus  otherwise known as little foot has recently been dated at 3.67  million years old through a new dating technique  making the australopithecus genus as old as the given the opposable big toe found on little foot  it seems that he was a good climber  and it is thought given the night predators of the region  he probably  like gorillas and chimpanzees  built a nesting platform at night  in the trees the earliest documented representative of the genus homo is homo habilis  which evolved around 2.8  million years and is arguably the earliest species for which there is positive evidence of the use of stone tools  the brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee  although it has been suggested that this was the time in which the human srgap2  gene doubled  producing a more rapid wiring of the frontal cortex  during the next million years a process of rapid encephalization occurred  and with the arrival of homo erectus and homo ergaster in the fossil record  cranial capacity had doubled to 850   such an increase in human brain size is equivalent to each generation having 125,000  more neurons than their parents   it is believed that homo erectus and homo ergaster were the first to use fire and complex tools  and were the first of the hominin line to leave africa  spreading throughout africa  asia  and europe between 1.3  to 1.8  million years ago according to the recent african origin of modern humans theory  modern humans evolved in africa possibly from homo heidelbergensis  homo rhodesiensis or homo antecessor and migrated out of the continent some 50,000  to 100,000  years ago  gradually replacing local populations of homo erectus  denisova hominins  homo floresiensis and homo archaic homo sapiens  the forerunner of anatomically modern humans  evolved in the middle paleolithic between 400,000  and 250,000  years recent dna evidence suggests that several haplotypes of neanderthal origin are present among all non-african  populations  and neanderthals and other hominins  such as denisovans  may have contributed up to 6%  of their genome to present-day  humans  suggestive of a limited inter-breeding  between these the transition to behavioral modernity with the development of symbolic culture  language  and specialized lithic technology happened around 50,000  years ago according to some although others point to evidence that suggests that a gradual change in behavior took place over a longer time sapiens is the only extant species of its genus  homo  while some  extinct  homo species might have been ancestors of homo sapiens  many  perhaps most  were likely  cousins   having speciated away from the ancestral hominin there is yet no consensus as to which of these groups should be considered a separate species and which should be a subspecies  this may be due to the dearth of fossils or to the slight differences used to classify species in the homo the sahara pump theory  describing an occasionally passable  wet  sahara desert  provides one possible explanation of the early variation in the genus homo based on archaeological and paleontological evidence  it has been possible to infer  to some extent  the ancient dietary of various homo species and to study the role of diet in physical and behavioral evolution within anthropologists and archaeologists subscribe to the toba catastrophe theory  which posits that the supereruption of lake toba on sumatran island in indonesia some 70,000  years ago caused global killing the majority of humans and creating a population bottleneck that affected the genetic inheritance of all humans habilis lived from about to 1.4  ma  the species evolved in south and east africa in the late pliocene or early pleistocene  2.5–2  ma  when it diverged from the australopithecines  homo habilis had smaller molars and larger brains than the australopithecines  and made tools from stone and perhaps animal bones  one of the first known hominins  it was nicknamed  handy man  by discoverer louis leakey due to its association with stone tools  some scientists have proposed moving this species out of homo and into australopithecus due to the morphology of its skeleton being more adapted to living on trees rather than to moving on two legs like homo may 2010,  a new species  homo gautengensis  was discovered in south are proposed species names for fossils from about 1.9–1.6  ma  whose relation to homo habilis is not yet clear the first fossils of homo erectus were discovered by dutch physician eugene dubois in 1891  on the indonesian island of java  he originally named the material pithecanthropus erectus based on its morphology  which he considered to be intermediate between that of humans and homo erectus lived from about 1.8  ma to about 70,000  years ago—which would indicate that they were probably wiped out by the toba catastrophe  however  nearby homo floresiensis survived it  the early phase of homo erectus  from 1.8  to 1.25  ma  is considered by some to be a separate species  homo ergaster  or as homo erectus ergaster  a subspecies of homo erectus in africa in the early pleistocene  1.5–1  ma  some populations of homo habilis are thought to have evolved larger brains and to have made more elaborate stone tools  these differences and others are sufficient for anthropologists to classify them as a new species  homo erectus—in the evolution of locking knees and the movement of the foramen magnum are thought to be likely drivers of the larger population changes  this species also may have used fire to cook meat  richard wrangham suggests that the fact that homo seems to have been ground dwelling  with reduced intestinal length  smaller dentition   and swelled our brains to their current  horrendously fuel-inefficient  suggest that control of fire and releasing increased nutritional value through cooking was the key adaptation that separated homo from tree-sleeping  famous example of homo erectus is peking man  others were found in asia  notably in indonesia   africa  and europe  many paleoanthropologists now use the term homo ergaster for the non-asian  forms of this group  and reserve homo erectus only for those fossils that are found in asia and meet certain skeletal and dental requirements which differ slightly from h  ergaster these are proposed as species that may be intermediate between h  erectus and h  heidelbergensis h  heidelbergensis   heidelberg man   lived from about 800,000  to about 300,000  years ago  also proposed as homo sapiens heidelbergensis or homo sapiens neanderthalensis  alternatively designated as homo sapiens lived in europe and asia from to about 28,000  years there are a number of clear anatomical differences between anatomically modern humans  amh  and neanderthal populations  many of these relate to the superior adaption to cold environments possessed by the neanderthal populations  their surface to volume ratio is an extreme version of that found amongst inuit populations  indicating that they were less inclined to lose body heat than were amh  from brain endocasts  neanderthals also had significantly larger brains  this would seem to indicate that the intellectual superiority of amh populations may be questionable  more recent research by eiluned pearce  chris stringer  r  i  m  dunbar  however  have shown important differences in brain architecture  for example  in both the orbital chamber size and in the size of the occipital lobe  the larger size suggests that the neanderthal had a better visual acuity than modern humans  this would give a superior vision in the inferior light conditions found in glacial europe  it also seems that the higher body mass of neanderthals had a correspondingly larger brain mass required for body care and control  the neanderthal populations seem to have been physically superior to amh populations  these differences may have been sufficient to give neanderthal populations an environmental superiority to amh populations from 75  to 45,000  years bp  with these differences  neanderthal brains show a smaller area was available for social functioning  plotting group size possible from endocrainial volume  suggests that amh populations  minus occipital lobe size   had a dunbars number of 144  possible relationships  neanderthal populations seem to have been limited to about 120  individuals  this would show up in a larger number of possible mates for amh humans  with increased risks of inbreeding amongst neanderthal populations  it also suggests that humans had larger trade catchment areas than neanderthals  confirmed in the distribution of stone tools   with larger populations  social and technological innovations were easier to fix in human populations  which may have all contributed to the fact that modern homo sapiens replaced the neanderthal populations by 28,000  evidence from sequencing mitochondrial dna suggested that no significant gene flow occurred between h  neanderthalensis and h  sapiens  and that the two were separate species that shared a common ancestor about 660,000  years however  a sequencing of the neanderthal genome in 2010  indicated that neanderthals did indeed interbreed with anatomically modern humans circa 45,000  to 80,000  years ago  at the approximate time that modern humans migrated out from africa  but before they dispersed into europe  asia and the genetic sequencing of a human from romania dated 40,000  years ago showed that 11%  of their genome was neanderthal  this would indicate that this individual had a neanderthal great grandparent  4  generations previously  it seems that this individual has left no living descendants nearly all modern non-african  humans have 1%  to 4%  of their dna derived from neanderthal and this finding is consistent with recent studies indicating that the divergence of some human alleles dates to one ma  although the interpretation of these studies has been neanderthals and homo sapiens could have co-existed  in europe for as long as 10,000  years  during which human populations exploded vastly outnumbering neanderthals  possibly outcompeting them by sheer numerical 2008,  archaeologists working at the site of denisova cave in the altai mountains of siberia uncovered a small bone fragment from the fifth finger of a juvenile member of artifacts  including a bracelet  excavated in the cave at the same level were carbon dated to around 40,000  bp  as dna had survived in the fossil fragment due to the cool climate of the denisova cave  both mtdna and nuclear dna were the divergence point of the mtdna was unexpectedly deep in the full genomic sequence suggested the denisovans belonged to the same lineage as neanderthals  with the two diverging shortly after their line split from the lineage that gave rise to modern modern humans are known to have overlapped with neanderthals in europe and the near east for possibly more than 40,000  and the discovery raises the possibility that neanderthals  denisovans  and modern humans may have co-existed  and interbred  the existence of this distant branch creates a much more complex picture of humankind during the late pleistocene than previously evidence has also been found that as much as 6%  of the dna of some modern melanesians derive from denisovans  indicating limited interbreeding in southeast thought to have originated in neanderthals and denisovans have been identified at several genetic loci in the genomes of modern humans outside of africa  hla haplotypes from denisovans and neanderthal represent more than half the hla alleles of modern indicating strong positive selection for these introgressed alleles  corinne simoneti at vanderbilt university  in nashville and her team have found from medical records of 28,000  people of european descent that the presence of neanderthal dna segments may be associated with a likelihood to suffer depression more flow of genes from neanderthal populations to modern human was not all one way  sergi castellano of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig  germany  has in 2016  reported that while denisovan and neanderthal genomes are more related to each other than they are to us  siberian neanderthal genomes show similarity to the modern human gene pool  more so than to european neanderthal populations  the evidence suggests that the neanderthal populations interbred with modern humans possibly 100,000  years ago  probably somewhere in the near of a neanderthal child at gibraltar show from brain development and teeth eruption that neanderthal children may have matured more rapidly than is the case for homo floresiensis  which lived from approximately 190,000  to 50,000  years before present  has been nicknamed hobbit for its small size  possibly a result of insular h  floresiensis is intriguing both for its size and its age  being an example of a recent species of the genus homo that exhibits derived traits not shared with modern humans  in other words  h  floresiensis shares a common ancestor with modern humans  but split from the modern human lineage and followed a distinct evolutionary path  the main find was a skeleton believed to be a woman of about 30  years of age  found in 2003,  it has been dated to approximately 18,000  years old  the living woman was estimated to be one meter in height  with a brain volume of just 380  cm3   considered small for a chimpanzee and less than a third of the h  sapiens average of 1400  needed however  there is an ongoing debate over whether h  floresiensis is indeed a separate some scientists hold that h  floresiensis was a modern h  sapiens with pathological this hypothesis is supported in part  because some modern humans who live on flores  the indonesian island where the skeleton was found  are pygmies  this  coupled with pathological dwarfism  could have resulted in a significantly diminutive human  the other major attack on h  floresiensis as a separate species is that it was found with tools only associated with h  hypothesis of pathological dwarfism  however  fails to explain additional anatomical features that are unlike those of modern humans  diseased or not  but much like those of ancient members of our genus  aside from cranial features  these features include the form of bones in the wrist  forearm  shoulder  knees  and feet  additionally  this hypothesis fails to explain the find of multiple examples of individuals with these same characteristics  indicating they were common to a large population  and not limited to one needed h  sapiens  the adjective sapiens is latin for  wise  or  intelligent   evolved between 350,000  and 260,000  years between 400,000  years ago and the second interglacial period in the middle pleistocene  around 250,000  years ago  the trend in intra-cranial  volume expansion and the elaboration of stone tool technologies developed  providing evidence for a transition from h  erectus to h  sapiens  the direct evidence suggests there was a migration of h  erectus out of africa  then a further speciation of h  sapiens from h  erectus in africa  a subsequent migration  both within and out of africa  eventually replaced the earlier dispersed h  erectus  this migration and origin theory is usually referred to as the  recent single-origin  hypothesis  or  out of africa  theory  current evidence does not preclude some multiregional evolution or some admixture of the migrant h  sapiens with existing homo populations  this is a hotly debated area of paleoanthropology current research has established that humans are genetically highly homogenous  that is  the dna of individuals is more alike than usual for most species  which may have resulted from their relatively recent evolution or the possibility of a population bottleneck resulting from cataclysmic natural events such as the toba distinctive genetic characteristics have arisen  however  primarily as the result of small groups of people moving into new environmental circumstances  these adapted traits are a very small component of the homo sapiens genome  but include various characteristics such as skin color and nose form  in addition to internal characteristics such as the ability to breathe more efficiently at high altitudes h  sapiens idaltu  from ethiopia  is an extinct sub-species  from about 160,000  years ago who is argued to be the direct ancestor of all modern – presentthe use of tools has been interpreted as a sign of intelligence  and it has been theorized that tool use may have stimulated certain aspects of human evolution  especially the continued expansion of the human paleontology has yet to explain the expansion of this organ over millions of years despite being extremely demanding in terms of energy consumption  the brain of a modern human consumes about 13  watts (260  kilocalories per day   a fifth of the body s resting power increased tool use would allow hunting for energy-rich  meat products  and would enable processing more energy-rich  plant products  researchers have suggested that early hominins were thus under evolutionary pressure to increase their capacity to create and use when early humans started to use tools is difficult to determine  because the more primitive these tools are  for example  sharp-edged  stones  the more difficult it is to decide whether they are natural objects or human there is some evidence that the australopithecines (4  ma  may have used broken bones as tools  but this is should be noted that many species make and use tools  but it is the human genus that dominates the areas of making and using more complex tools  the oldest known tools are the oldowan stone tools from ethiopia  2.5–2.6  million years old  a homo fossil was found near some oldowan tools  and its age was noted at 2.3  million years old  suggesting that maybe the homo species did indeed create and use these tools  it is a possibility but does not yet represent solid the third metacarpal styloid process enables the hand bone to lock into the wrist bones  allowing for greater amounts of pressure to be applied to the wrist and hand from a grasping thumb and fingers  it allows humans the dexterity and strength to make and use complex tools  this unique anatomical feature separates humans from apes and other nonhuman primates  and is not seen in human fossils older than 1.8  million wood noted that paranthropus co-existed  with the early homo species in the area of the  oldowan industrial complex  over roughly the same span of time  although there is no direct evidence which identifies paranthropus as the tool makers  their anatomy lends to indirect evidence of their capabilities in this area  most paleoanthropologists agree that the early homo species were indeed responsible for most of the oldowan tools found  they argue that when most of the oldowan tools were found in association with human fossils  homo was always present  but paranthropus was 1994,  randall susman used the anatomy of opposable thumbs as the basis for his argument that both the homo and paranthropus species were toolmakers  he compared bones and muscles of human and chimpanzee thumbs  finding that humans have 3  muscles which are lacking in chimpanzees  humans also have thicker metacarpals with broader heads  allowing more precise grasping than the chimpanzee hand can perform  susman posited that modern anatomy of the human opposable thumb is an evolutionary response to the requirements associated with making and handling tools and that both species were indeed tools are first attested around 2.6  million years ago  when h  habilis in eastern africa used so-called  pebble tools  choppers made out of round pebbles that had been split by simple this marks the beginning of the paleolithic  or old stone age  its end is taken to be the end of the last ice age  around 10,000  years ago  the paleolithic is subdivided into the lower paleolithic  early stone age   ending around 350,000–300,000  years ago  the middle paleolithic  middle stone age   until 50,000–30,000  years ago  and the upper paleolithic   late stone age   50,000-10,000  years ago archaeologists working in the great rift valley in kenya claim to have discovered the oldest known stone tools in the world  dated to around 3.3  million years ago  the implements are some 700,000  years older than stone tools from ethiopia that previously held this period from 700,000–300,000  years ago is also known as the acheulean  when h  ergaster  or erectus  made large stone hand axes out of flint and quartzite  at first quite rough  early acheulian   later  retouched  by additional  more-subtle  strikes at the sides of the flakes  after 350,000  bp the more refined so-called  levallois technique was developed  a series of consecutive strikes  by which scrapers  slicers   racloirs    needles  and flattened needles were finally  after about 50,000  bp  ever more refined and specialized flint tools were made by the neanderthals and the immigrant cro-magnons   knives  blades  skimmers   in this period they also started to make tools out of bone until about 50,000–40,000  years ago  the use of stone tools seems to have progressed stepwise  each phase  h  habilis  h  ergaster  h  neanderthalensis  started at a higher level than the previous one  but after each phase started  further development was slow  currently paleoanthropologists are debating whether these homo species possessed some or many of the cultural and behavioral traits associated with modern humans such as language  complex symbolic thinking  technological creativity etc  it seems that they were culturally conservative maintaining simple technologies and foraging patterns over very long periods around 50,000  bp  modern human culture started to evolve more rapidly  the transition to behavioral modernity has been characterized by most as a eurasian  great leap or as the  upper palaeolithic due to the sudden appearance of distinctive signs of modern behavior and big game in the archaeological record  some other scholars consider the transition to have been more gradual  noting that some features had already appeared among archaic african homo sapiens since 200,000  years recent evidence suggests that the australian aboriginal population separated from the african population 75,000  years ago  and that they made a sea journey of up to 160  km 60,000  years ago  which may diminish the evidence of the upper paleolithic humans started burying their dead  using animal hides to make clothing  hunting with more sophisticated techniques  such as using trapping pits or driving animals off cliffs   and engaging in cave as human culture advanced  different populations of humans introduced novelty to existing technologies  artifacts such as fish hooks  buttons  and bone needles show signs of variation among different populations of humans  something that had not been seen in human cultures prior to 50,000  bp  typically  h  neanderthalensis populations do not vary in their technologies  although the chatelperronian assemblages have been found to be neanderthal innovations produced as a result of exposure to the homo sapiens aurignacian concrete examples of modern human behavior  anthropologists include specialization of tools  use of jewellery and images  such as cave drawings   organization of living space  rituals  for example  burials with grave gifts   specialized hunting techniques  exploration of less hospitable geographical areas  and barter trade networks  debate continues as to whether a  revolution  led to modern humans   the big bang of human consciousness    or whether the evolution was more selection still affects modern human populations  for example  the population at risk of the severe debilitating disease kuru has significant over-representation  of an immune variant of the prion protein gene g127v  versus non-immune  alleles  the frequency of this genetic variant is due to the survival of immune other reported trends appear to include lengthening of the human reproductive period and reduction in cholesterol levels  blood glucose and blood pressure in some populations has been argued that human evolution has accelerated since the development of agriculture 10,000  years ago and civilization some 5,000  years ago  resulting  it is claimed  in substantial genetic differences between different current human lactase persistence is an example of such recent evolution  recent human evolution seems to have been largely confined to genetic resistance to infectious disease that has appeared in human populations by crossing the species barrier from domesticated is a common misconception that humans have stopped evolving and current genetic changes are purely genetic drift  although selection pressure on some traits  such as resistance to smallpox  has decreased in modern human life  humans are still undergoing natural selection for many other traits  for instance  menopause is evolving to occur list is in chronological order across the table by genus  some species subspecies names are well-established,  and some are less established – especially in genus homo  please see articles for more information
