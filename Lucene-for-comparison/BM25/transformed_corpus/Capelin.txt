 capelin -  wikipediathe capelin or caplin  mallotus villosus  is a small forage fish of the smelt family found in the north atlantic  north pacific and arctic in summer  it grazes on dense swarms of plankton at the edge of the ice shelf  larger capelin also eat a great deal of krill and other crustaceans  among others  whales  seals  atlantic cod  atlantic mackerel  squid and seabirds prey on capelin  in particular during the spawning season of the capelin while it migrates southwards  capelin spawn on sand and gravel bottoms or sandy beaches at the age of 2–6  years  and have an extremely high mortality rate on the beaches after spawning  for males close to needed  males reach 20  cm (8  in  in length  while females are up to 25.2  cm (10  in  they are olive-colored  dorsally  shading to silver on sides  males have a translucent ridge on both sides of their bodies  the ventral aspects of the males iridesce reddish at the time of spawn capelin in the barents sea and around iceland are stocks that perform extensive seasonal migrations  barents sea capelin migrate during winter and early spring to the coast of northern norway  finnmark  and the kola peninsula  russia  for spawning  during summer and autumn capelin migrate north-  and north-eastward  for capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in the plankton-rich  oceanic area between iceland  greenland  and jan mayen  capelin distribution and migration is linked with ocean currents and water masses  around iceland  maturing capelin usually undertake extensive northward feeding migrations in spring and summer and the return migration takes place in september to november  the spawning migration starts from north of iceland in december to january  in a paper published in 2009,  researchers from iceland recounted their application of an interacting particle model to the capelin stock around iceland  successfully predicting the spawning migration route for an r-selected  species  capelin have a high reproductive potential and an intrinsic population growth they reproduce by spawning and their main spawning season occurs in spring  but can extend into the summer  the majority of capelin are three or four years old when they the males migrate directly to the shallow water of fjords  where spawning will take place  while the females remain in deeper water until they are completely mature  once the females are mature  they will migrate to the spawning grounds and this process usually takes place at in the north european atlantic spawning typically occurs over sand or gravel at depths of 2  to 100  m (7–328  but in the north pacific and waters off newfoundland most spawn on beaches  jumping as far up land as possible  with some managing to strand themselves in the although some other fish species leave their eggs in locations that dry out  a few  such as plainfin midshipman  may even remain on land with the eggs during low tide  or on plants above the water  splash tetras   jumping onto land en masse to spawn is unique to the capelin  grunions and grass after the female capelins have spawned  they immediately leave the spawning grounds and will potentially spawn again in the following years if they survive  the males do not leave the spawning grounds and will potentially spawn more than once throughout the male capelin are considered to be semelparous because they die soon after the spawning season is is an important forage fish  and is essential as the key food of the atlantic cod  the northeast atlantic cod and capelin fisheries therefore are managed by a multispecies approach developed by the main resource owners norway and russia in some years with large quantities of atlantic herring in the barents sea  capelin seem to be heavily affected  probably both food competition and herring feeding on capelin larvae lead to collapses in the capelin stock  however  in some years there has been good recruitment of capelin despite a high herring biomass  suggesting that herring are only one factor influencing capelin dynamics in the provinces of quebec  particularly in the gaspé peninsula  and newfoundland and labrador in canada  it is a regular summertime practice for locals to go to the beach and scoop the capelin up in nets or whatever is available  as the capelin  roll in  in the millions each year at the end of may or in early capelin is used for fish meal and oil industry products  but is also appreciated as food  the flesh is agreeable in flavor  resembling herring  capelin roe   masago   is considered a high-value  product  it is also sometimes mixed with wasabi or green food coloring and wasabi flavor and sold as  wasabi caviar   often  masago is commercialized as ebiko and used as a substitute for tobiko  flying fish owing to its similar appearance and taste —although the mouthfeel is different due to the individual eggs being smaller and less crunchy than tobiko
