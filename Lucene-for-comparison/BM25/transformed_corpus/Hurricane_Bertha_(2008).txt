 hurricane bertha (2008)  -  wikipediahurricane bertha was the longest-lived  atlantic tropical cyclone on record during july  and it also attained tropical storm intensity farther east than any other system on record during the month  the second named storm  first hurricane  and first major hurricane of the active 2008  season  bertha developed into a tropical depression on july 3  from a tropical wave that departed western africa two days prior  on a west-northwest  to northwest track  the depression intensified into tropical storm bertha six hours formation and ultimately attained hurricane intensity on july 7.  a period of rapid deepening brought the cyclone to its peak as a category 3  hurricane with winds of 125  mph (205  km h  late that afternoon  changes in wind shear and the storm s internal structure allowed bertha to fluctuate in intensity over the next week as it passed very near bermuda  but a track over cooler waters eventually caused the system to become an extratropical cyclone by july 20.  it continued northeast and was absorbed by another low near iceland the following day  rough surf propelled by bertha killed three people along the east coast of the united states  hundreds of other swimmers were injured and or required rescuing  in bermuda  some streets were flooded and strong gusts cut power to approximately 7,500  homes  only minor damage was observed on july 1,  the national hurricane center  nhc  began monitoring a vigorous tropical wave  accompanied by both a weak surface low and a large area of shower and thunderstorm activity  just off the western coast of the disturbance began to show signs of organization early on july satellite imagery the next morning showcased deep convection over the apparent center and increasingly pronounced banding features in the northwestern thus  in conjunction with satellite wind data  the storm was classified as a tropical depression by 06:00  utc on july 3,  located about 255  miles (410  km  south-southeast  of cabo the nhc noted that global modelling suggested the possibility of tropical development over a week prior  a  remarkable achievement  at the the storm s cloud pattern continued to coalesce  and it was upgraded to tropical storm bertha six hours the southern periphery of a mid-level  ridge over the open atlantic  bertha moved swiftly west-northwest  to northwest for several despite being embedded within an environment of low vertical wind shear  the storm passed over ocean temperatures near 77°f  (25°c),  and its overall appearance was characterized by intermittent bursts of deep convection near the eventually  by late on july 5,  bertha began to enter warmer waters and gain convection coalesced throughout july 6,  and a series of microwave passes later that day indicated the formation of an eye-like  feature  despite some tilt to bertha s low-  and mid-level  rapid deepening ensued as the aforementioned eye became readily apparent and convection in the eyewall bertha became the season s first hurricane around 06:00  utc on july 7,  and by 21:00  utc that afternoon  attained its peak as a category 3  major hurricane with winds of 125  mph (205  km h  and a minimum barometric pressure of 952  mbar  hpa  28.12  cyclone s rapid intensification phase was equaled by a rapid weakening phase almost immediately after peak and bertha fell to minimal hurricane intensity by 06:00  utc on july 9  under the influence of strong wind shear  these unfavorable winds quickly slackened  allowing bertha to regain category 2  intensity by 18:00  utc that day  before the hurricane began an eyewall replacement cycle  a weak steering regime directed the storm just east of bermuda as it weakened to a tropical storm on july 13,  and a large upper-level  low over the central atlantic steered it east and after generally maintaining its strength for several days  an eye redeveloped and convection became more symmetric about the feature on july prompting the nhc to upgrade bertha to a hurricane around 18:00  utc that the storm rapidly accelerated ahead of a trough off the east coast of the united states  forcing bertha into rapidly cooler waters  its wind field became extremely asymmetric and deep convection near the center indicative of an extratropical transition that bertha completed by 12:00  utc on july 20.  the post-tropical  cyclone continued northeast and merged with a larger mid-latitude  low near iceland the next a tropical storm  bertha dropped rainfall over the southern cape verde islands  no damages or deaths were july 7,  bermuda residents began purchasing lamps  tarpaulins and flashlights in anticipation of hurricane bertha  in the sudden rush  some stores sold out of the emergency measures organisation urged the public to monitor forecasts and remain away from the bermuda weather service  meanwhile  hoisted tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the island upon its on july 10,  the department of parks placed high surf warning signs along the south shore beaches as bertha sent strong waves ahead of its path  barricades were erected at all of the island s beaches  which were closed to swimming and flights into and out of bermuda were disrupted on july 14  as the storm made its final approach to the island  jetblue and delta air lines canceled their flights while american airlines executed its flights to miami and new york a day early  escaping before the tropical storm arrived  british airways delayed its flight to the afternoon  hoping that the storm would have passed by the time its plane arrives  ferry service and traffic to st  george s was canceled for the whole some roads were flooded  and tree branches were broken by wind gusts that reached 91  mph (146  km h  at an elevated weather station on the downed power lines cut electricity to approximately 7,500  homes  but engineers from the bermuda electric light company limited worked quickly to restore a total of 4.77  in (121  mm  of rainfall fell at the l f  wade international hurricane produced strong waves and rip currents along the east coast of the united states  which caused three deaths along the coastline of new jersey  on july 12,  a 51-year-old  man died after suddenly losing consciousness during his rescue  on july 13,  three men swam out to a buoy about 300  ft (91.4  m  off the coast of wildwood beach when they were overcome by the rough surf  one swimmer was found unconscious in the water and pronounced dead at the scene  the second was never found and presumed dead  and the third was rescued  during the event  a total of 57  people had to be rescued along the coast of new three rip currents also caused 55  injuries throughout beaches in delaware  the injuries ranged from minor scrapes to broken four people were also injured in north carolina  one of which nearly drowned as he had aspirated water shortly before a lifeguard rescued him  at least 60  people had to be rescued from the rough seas over a two-day  17  days  hurricane bertha holds the records for the longest-lived  july atlantic tropical cyclone on it also set the record for the easternmost-forming  tropical storm during the month  at
