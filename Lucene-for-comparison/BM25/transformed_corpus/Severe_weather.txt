 severe weather -  wikipediasevere weather refers to any dangerous meteorological phenomena with the potential to cause damage  serious social disruption  or loss of human types of severe weather phenomena vary  depending on the latitude  altitude  topography  and atmospheric conditions  high winds  hail  excessive precipitation  and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather  as are thunderstorms  downbursts  tornadoes  waterspouts  tropical cyclones  and extratropical cyclones  regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards  snowstorms  ice storms  and generally define severe weather as any aspect of the weather that poses risks to life  property or requires the intervention of authorities  a narrower definition of severe weather is any weather phenomena relating to severe to the world meteorological organization  wmo   severe weather can be categorized into two groups  general severe weather and localized severe nor easters  european wind storms  and the phenomena that accompany them form over wide geographic areas  these occurrences are classified as general severe downbursts and tornadoes are more localized and therefore have a more limited geographic effect  these forms of weather are classified as localized severe the term severe weather is technically not the same phenomenon as extreme weather  extreme weather describes unusual weather events that are at the extremes of the historical distribution for a given severe weather occurs from the same conditions that generate ordinary thunderstorms  atmospheric moisture  lift  often from thermals   and a wide variety of conditions cause severe weather  several factors can convert thunderstorms into severe weather  for example  a pool of cold air aloft may aid in the development of large hail from an otherwise innocuous appearing thunderstorm  however  the most severe hail and tornadoes are produced by supercell thunderstorms  and the worst downbursts and derechos (straight-line  winds  are produced by bow echoes  both of these types of storms tend to form in environments high in wind hurricanes  tornadoes  and thunderstorms are considered to be the most destructive weather-related  natural disasters  although these weather phenomena are all related to cumulonimbus clouds  they form and develop under different conditions and geographic locations  the relationship between these weather events and their formation requirements are used to develop models to predict the most frequent and possible locations  this information is used to notify affected areas and save lives severe thunderstorms can be assessed in three different categories  these are  approaching severe    severe   and  significantly severe  approaching severe is defined as hail between 1⁄2  to 1  inch (13  to 25  mm  diameter or winds between 50  and 58  m p h  (50  knots  80–93  km h   in the united states  such storms will usually warrant a significant weather is defined as hail 1  inch (25  mm  diameter or larger  winds 58  m p h (93  km h   or stronger  or a severe is defined as hail 2  inches (51  mm  in diameter or larger  winds 75  m p h  (65  knots  120  km h  or stronger  a tornado of strength ef2  or stronger  the occurrence of flash flood phenomena by heavy precipitation  or extreme severe and significant severe events warrant a severe thunderstorm warning from the united states national weather service  excludes flash floods   the environment canada  the australian bureau of meteorology  or the meteorological service of new zealand if the event occurs in those countries  if a tornado is occurring  a tornado has been seen by spotters  or is imminent  doppler weather radar has observed strong rotation in a storm  indicating an incipient tornado   the severe thunderstorm warning will be superseded by a tornado warning in the united states and severe weather outbreak is typically considered to be when ten or more tornadoes  some of which will likely be long-tracked  and violent  and many large hail or damaging wind reports occur within one or more consecutive days  severity is also dependent on the size of the geographic area affected  whether it covers hundreds or thousands of square winds are known to cause damage  depending upon their strength wind speeds as low as 23  knots (43  km h  may lead to power outages when tree branches fall and disrupt power some species of trees are more vulnerable to winds  trees with shallow roots are more prone to uproot  and brittle trees such as eucalyptus  sea hibiscus  and avocado are more prone to branch gusts may cause poorly designed suspension bridges to sway  when wind gusts harmonize with the frequency of the swaying bridge  the bridge may fail as occurred with the tacoma narrows bridge in winds  caused by individual thunderstorms  thunderstorm complexes  derechos  tornadoes  extratropical cyclones  or tropical cyclones can destroy mobile homes and structurally damage buildings with foundations  winds of this strength due to downslope winds off terrain have been known to shatter windows and sandblast paint from winds exceed 135  knots (250  km h  within strong tropical cyclones and tornadoes  homes completely collapse  and significant damage is done to larger buildings  total destruction to man-made  structures occurs when winds reach 175  knots (324  km h   the saffir–simpson scale for cyclones and enhanced fujita scale  torro scale in europe  for tornados were developed to help estimate wind speed from the damage they dangerous rotating column of air in contact with both the surface of the earth and the base of a cumulonimbus cloud  thundercloud  or a cumulus cloud  in rare cases  tornadoes come in many sizes but typically form a visible condensation funnel whose narrowest end reaches the earth and surrounded by a cloud of debris and wind speeds generally average between 40  miles per hour (64  km h  and 110  miles per hour (180  km h   they are approximately 250  feet (76  m  across and travel a few miles  kilometers  before dissipating  some attain wind speeds in excess of 300  miles per hour (480  km h   may stretch more than two miles (3.2  km  across  and maintain contact with the ground for dozens of miles  more than 100  despite being one of the most destructive weather phenomena  are generally short-lived.  a long-lived  tornado generally lasts no more than an hour  but some have been known to last for 2  hours or longer  for example  the tri-state  tornado   due to their relatively short duration  less information is known about the development and formation of are created within thunderstorms by significantly rain-cooled  air  which  upon reaching ground level  spreads out in all directions and produce strong winds  unlike winds in a tornado  winds in a downburst are not rotational but are directed outwards from the point where they strike land or water  dry downbursts  are associated with thunderstorms with very little while wet downbursts are generated by thunderstorms with large amounts of rainfall  microbursts are very small downbursts with winds that extend up to 2.5  miles (4  km  from their source  while macrobursts are large-scale  downbursts with winds that extend in excess of 2.5  miles (4  the heat burst is created by vertical currents on the backside of old outflow boundaries and squall lines where rainfall is lacking  heat bursts generate significantly higher temperatures due to the lack of rain-cooled  air in their derechos are longer  usually stronger  forms of downburst winds characterized by straight-lined  create vertical wind shear or microbursts  which are dangerous to these convective downbursts can produce damaging winds  lasting 5  to 30  minutes  with wind speeds as high as 168  mph (75  m s   and cause tornado-like  damage on the ground  downbursts also occur much more frequently than tornadoes  with ten downburst damage reports for every one squall line is an elongated line of severe thunderstorms that can form along or ahead of a cold the squall line typically contains heavy precipitation  hail  frequent lightning  strong straight line winds  and possibly tornadoes or severe weather in the form of strong straight-line  winds can be expected in areas where the squall line forms a bow echo  in the farthest portion of the tornadoes can be found along waves within a line echo wave pattern  lewp  where mesoscale low-pressure  areas are summer bow echoes are called derechos  and move quickly over large a wake low or a mesoscale low-pressure  area forms behind the rain shield  a high pressure system under the rain canopy  of a mature squall line and is sometimes associated with a heat lines often cause severe straight-line  wind damage  and most non-tornadic  wind damage is caused from squall although the primary danger from squall lines is straight-line  winds  some squall lines also contain weak high winds can be caused by mature tropical cyclones  called hurricanes in the united states and canada and typhoons in eastern asia   a tropical cyclone s heavy surf created by such winds may cause harm to marine life either close to or upon the surface of the water  such as coral coastal regions may receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone while inland regions are relatively safe from the strong winds  due to their rapid dissipation over land  however  severe flooding can occur even far inland because of high amounts of rain from tropical cyclones and their remnants waterspouts are generally defined as tornadoes or non-supercell  tornadoes that develop over bodies of are not known for inflicting much damage because they are not commonly exposed to land  but they are capable of traveling over land  some waterspouts are known to produce hurricane-strength  winds and are capable of producing equivalent damage  vegetation  weakly constructed buildings  and other infrastructure may be destroyed by waterspouts  automobiles may be lifted by advancing waterspouts  heavy precipitation may be noted  developed from the water raised by the wind currents  waterspouts do not generally last long over terrestrial environments as the friction produced easily dissipates the winds  strong horizontal winds cause waterspouts to destroying the concentration of the updrafts  while not generally as dangerous as  classic  tornadoes  waterspouts can overturn boats  and they can cause severe damage to larger local windstorms in europe that develop from winds off the north atlantic  these windstorms are commonly associated with the destructive extratropical cyclones and their low pressure frontal european windstorms occur mainly in the seasons of autumn and synoptic-scale  extratropical storm along the east coast of the united states and atlantic canada is called a nor easter  they are so named because their winds come from the northeast  especially in the coastal areas of the northeastern united states and atlantic canada  more specifically  it describes a low-pressure  area whose center of rotation is just off the east coast and whose leading winds in the left forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast  nor easters may cause coastal flooding  coastal erosion  and hurricane-force  winds an unusual form of windstorm that is characterized by the existence of large quantities of sand and dust particles carried by the dust storms frequently develop during periods of droughts  or over arid and semi-arid  regions dust storms have numerous hazards and are capable of causing deaths  visibility may be reduced dramatically  so risks of vehicle and aircraft crashes are possible  additionally  the particulates may reduce oxygen intake by the potentially resulting in suffocation  damage can also be inflicted upon the eyes due to storms can many issues for agricultural industries as well  soil erosion is one of the most common hazards and decreases arable lands  dust and sand particles can cause severe weathering of buildings and rock formations  nearby bodies of water may be polluted by settling dust and sand  killing aquatic organisms  decrease in exposure to sunlight can affect plant growth  as well as decrease in infrared radiation may cause decreased temperatures the most common cause of wildfires varies throughout the world  in the united states  canada  and northwest china  lightning is the major source of ignition  in other parts of the world  human involvement is a major contributor  for instance  in mexico  central america  south america  africa  southeast asia  fiji  and new zealand  wildfires can be attributed to human activities such as animal husbandry  agriculture  and land-conversion  burning  human carelessness is a major cause of wildfires in china and in the mediterranean basin  in australia  the source of wildfires can be traced to both lightning strikes and human activities such as machinery sparks and cast-away  cigarette wildfires have a rapid forward rate of spread  fros  when burning through dense  uninterrupted they can move as fast as 10.8  kilometers per hour (6.7  mph  in forests and 22  kilometers per hour (14  mph  in wildfires can advance tangential to the main front to form a flanking front  or burn in the opposite direction of the main front by may also spread by jumping or spotting as winds and vertical convection columns carry firebrands  hot wood embers  and other burning materials through the air over roads  rivers  and other barriers that may otherwise act as torching and fires in tree canopies encourage spotting  and dry ground fuels that surround a wildfire are especially vulnerable to ignition from spotting can create spot fires as hot embers and firebrands ignite fuels downwind from the fire  in australian bushfires  spot fires are known to occur as far as 10  kilometers (6  mi  from the fire since the mid-1980s,  earlier snowmelt and associated warming has also been associated with an increase in length and severity of the wildfire season in the western united form of thunderstorm that produces precipitating hailstones is known as a hailstorms are generally capable of developing in any geographic area where thunderclouds  cumulonimbus  are present  although they are most frequent in tropical and monsoon the updrafts and downdrafts within cumulonimbus clouds cause water molecules to freeze and solidify  creating hailstones and other forms of solid due to their larger density  these hailstones become heavy enough to overcome the density of the cloud and fall towards the ground  the downdrafts in cumulonimbus clouds can also cause increases in the speed of the falling hailstones  the term  hailstorm  is usually used to describe the existence of significant quantities or size of hailstones hailstones can cause serious damage  notably to automobiles  aircraft  skylights  glass-roofed  structures  livestock  and rarely  massive hailstones have been known to cause concussions or fatal head trauma  hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history  one of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 12th  century in wellesbourne  the largest hailstone in terms of maximum circumference and length ever recorded in the united states fell in 2003  in aurora  nebraska  usa  the hailstone had a diameter of 7  inches (18  cm  and a circumference of 18.75  inches (47.6  rainfall can lead to a number of hazards  most of which are floods or hazards resulting from floods  flooding is the inundation of areas that are not normally under water  it is typically divided into three classes  river flooding  which relates to rivers rising outside their normals banks  flash flooding  which is the process where a landscape  often in urban and arid environments  is subjected to rapid and coastal flooding  which can be caused by strong winds from tropical or non-tropical  meteorologically  excessive rains occur within a plume of air with high amounts of moisture  also known as an atmospheric river  which is directed around an upper level cold-core  low or a tropical flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving  thunderstorms and are usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it  flash floods are most common in dense populated urban environments  where less plants and bodies of water are presented to absorb and contain the extra water  flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure  such as bridges  and weakly constructed buildings  plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water  automobiles parked within experiencing areas can also be displaced  soil erosion can occur as well  exposing risks of landslide phenomena  like all forms of flooding phenomenon  flash flooding can also spread and produce waterborne and insect-borne  diseases cause by microorganisms  flash flooding can be caused by extensive rainfall released by tropical cyclones of any strength or the sudden thawing effect of ice wind shifts lead to long-lasting  wet seasons which produce the bulk of annual precipitation in areas such as southeast asia  australia  western africa  eastern south america  mexico  and the philippines  widespread flooding occurs if rainfall is which can lead to landslides and mudflows in mountainous floods cause rivers to exceed their capacity with nearby buildings becoming flooding may be exacerbated if there are fires during the previous dry season  this may cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic and repel organizations help their residents deal with wet-season  floods though floodplain mapping and information on erosion control  mapping is conducted to help determine areas that may be more prone to erosion control instructions are provided through outreach over the telephone or the waters that occur during monsoon seasons can often host numerous protozoa  bacterial  and viral mosquitoes and flies will lay their eggs within the contaminated bodies of water  these disease agents may cause infections of foodborne and waterborne diseases  diseases associated with exposure to flood waters include malaria  cholera  typhoid  hepatitis a  and the common possible trenchfoot infections may also occur when personnel are exposed for extended periods of time within flooded tropical cyclone is a storm system characterized by a low-pressure  center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and flooding rain  a tropical cyclone feeds on heat released when moist air rises  resulting in condensation of water vapor contained in the moist air  tropical cyclones may produce torrential rain  high waves  and damaging storm heavy rains produce significant inland flooding  storm surges may produce extensive coastal flooding up to 40  kilometres (25  mi  from the coastline although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property  they are also important factors in the precipitation regimes of areas they affect  they bring much-needed  precipitation to otherwise dry areas in their path can receive a year s worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone tropical cyclones can also relieve drought they also carry heat and energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes  which makes them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation mechanism  as a result  tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the earth s troposphere when extratropical cyclones deposit heavy  wet snow with a snow-water  equivalent  swe  ratio of between 6:1  and 12:1  and a weight in excess of 10  pounds per square foot (~50  piles onto trees or electricity lines  significant damage may occur on a scale usually associated with strong tropical an avalanche can occur with a sudden thermal or mechanical impact on snow that has accumulated on a mountain  which causes the snow to rush downhill suddenly  preceding an avalanche is a phenomenon known as an avalanche wind caused by the approaching avalanche itself  which adds to its destructive large amounts of snow which accumulate on top of man-made  structures can lead to structural during snowmelt  acidic precipitation which previously fell in the snow pack is released and harms marine snow is produced in the winter in the shape of one or more elongated bands  this occurs when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water  providing energy and picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited on the lee for more information on this effect see the main article conditions within blizzards often include large quantities of blowing snow and strong winds which may significantly reduce visibility  reduced viability of personnel on foot may result in extended exposure to the blizzard and increase the chance of becoming lost  the strong winds associated with blizzards create wind chill that can result in frostbites and hypothermia  the strong winds present in blizzards are capable of damaging plants and may cause power outages  frozen pipes  and cut off fuel precipitation pattern of nor easters is similar to other mature extratropical storms  nor easters can cause heavy rain or snow  either within their comma-head  precipitation pattern or along their trailing cold or stationary front  nor easters can occur at any time of the year but are mostly known for their presence in the winter severe european windstorms are often characterized by heavy precipitation as storms are also known as a silver storm  referring to the color of the freezing ice storms are caused by liquid precipitation which freezes upon cold surfaces and leads to the gradual development of a thickening layer of the accumulations of ice during the storm can be extremely destructive  trees and vegetation can be destroyed and in turn may bring down power lines  causing the loss of heat and communication roofs of buildings and automobiles may be severely damaged  gas pipes can become frozen or even damaged causing gas leaks  avalanches may develop due to the extra weight of the ice present  visibility can be reduced dramatically  the aftermath of an ice storm may result in severe flooding due to sudden thawing  with large quantities of displaced water  especially near lakes  rivers  and bodies of form of severe weather is drought  which is a prolonged period of persistently dry weather  that is  absence of although droughts do not develop or progress as quickly as other forms of severe their effects can be just as deadly  in fact  droughts are classified and measured based upon these droughts have a variety of severe effects  they can cause crops to and they can severely deplete water resources  sometimes interfering with human a drought in the 1930s  known as the dust bowl affected 50  million acres of farmland in the central united in economic terms  they can cost many billions of dollars  a drought in the united states in 1988  caused over $40  billion in exceeding the economic totals of hurricane andrew  the great flood of 1993,  and the 1989  loma prieta in addition to the other severe effects  the dry conditions caused by droughts also significantly increase the risk of official definitions vary  a heat wave is generally defined as a prolonged period with excessive although heat waves do not cause as much economic damage as other types of severe weather  they are extremely dangerous to humans and animals  according to the united states national weather service  the average total number of heat-related  fatalities each year is higher than the combined total fatalities for floods  tornadoes  lightning strikes  and in australia  heat waves cause more fatalities than any other type of severe as in droughts  plants can also be severely affected by heat waves  which are often accompanied by dry conditions  can cause plants to lose their moisture and heat waves are often more severe when combined with high
