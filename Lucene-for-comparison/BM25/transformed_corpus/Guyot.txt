 guyot -  wikipediaa guyot  pronounced  ɡiːˈjoʊ    also known as a tablemount  is an isolated underwater volcanic mountain  seamount   with a flat top over 200  m (660  ft  below the surface of the sea  the diameters of these flat summits can exceed 10  km (6.2  there are 283  guyots in the world ocean  with the north pacific having 119,  south pacific 77,  south atlantic 43,  indian ocean 28,  north atlantic 8,  southern ocean 6  and the mediterranean has 2  guyots  there are none in the arctic ocean  guyots are much larger in area  mean of 3,313  km2)  than seamounts  mean area of 790  km2).  guyot was named after the swiss-american  geographer and geologist arnold henry guyot  died 1884).  the term was coined by harry hammond hess  guyots are most commonly found in the pacific ocean  guyots show evidence of having been above the surface with gradual subsidence through stages from fringed reefed mountain  coral atoll  and finally a flat topped submerged the steepness gradient of most guyots is about 20  degrees  to technically be considered a guyot or tablemount  they must stand at least 914  m (3,000  ft  however  there are many undersea mounts that can range from just less than 91  m (300  ft  to around 914  m (3,000  very large oceanic volcanic constructions  hundreds of km across  are called oceanic seamounts are made by extrusion of lavas piped upward in stages from sources within the earth s mantle to vents on the seafloor  seamounts provide data on movements of tectonic plates on which they ride  and on the rheology of the underlying lithosphere  the trend of a seamount chain traces the direction of motion of the lithospheric plate over a more or less fixed heat source in the underlying asthenosphere part of the earth s there are thought to be up to an estimated 50,000  seamounts in the pacific the emperor seamounts are an excellent example of an entire volcanic chain undergoing this process and contain many guyots among their other examples another factor contributing to the guyots being underwater has to do with the oceanic ridges  such as the mid-atlantic  ridge in the atlantic ocean  mid-ocean  ridges gradually spread apart over time  due to molten lava being pushed up under the surface of the earth and creating new rock  as the mid-ocean  ridges spread apart  the guyots move with them  thus continually sinking deeper into the depths of the ocean  thus  the greater amount of time that passes  the deeper the guyots although guyots can be hundreds of millions of years old  there have been some recently discovered guyots that were only formed within the last 1  million years  including bowie seamount on the coast of british columbia  canada one guyot in particular  the great meteor tablemount in the northeast atlantic ocean  stands at more than 4,000  m (13,123  ft   the guyot s diameter is 110  km (68  guyots are also associated with specific lifeforms and varying amounts of organic matter  local increases in chlorophyll a  enhanced carbon incorporation rates and changes in phytoplankton species composition were associated with the were first recognized by harry hammond hess in 1945  who collected data using echo-sounding  equipment on a ship he commanded during world war the data showed the configuration of the seafloor where he saw that some undersea mountains had flat tops  hess called these undersea mountains  guyots  because they resembled guyot hall  the flat roofed biology and geology building at princeton university which was itself named after the 19th  century geographer arnold henry hess postulated they were once volcanic islands that were beheaded by wave action yet they are now deep under sea level  this idea was used to help bolster the theory of plate
