 venus -  wikipediavenus is the second planet from the sun  orbiting it every 224.7  earth it has the longest rotation period (243  days  of any planet in the solar system and rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets  it has no natural satellites  it is named after the roman goddess of love and beauty  it is the second-brightest  natural object in the night sky after the moon  reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6  – bright enough to cast shadows at night and  rarely  visible to the naked eye in broad orbiting within earth s orbit  venus is an inferior planet and never appears to venture far from the sun  its maximum angular distance from the sun  elongation  is 47.8°.venus  is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called earth s  sister planet  because of their similar size  mass  proximity to the sun  and bulk composition  it is radically different from earth in other respects  it has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets  consisting of more than 96%  carbon dioxide  the atmospheric pressure at the planet s surface is 92  times that of earth  or roughly the pressure found 900  m (3,000  ft  underwater on earth  venus is by far the hottest planet in the solar system  with a mean surface temperature of 735  k (462  °c  863  °f   even though mercury is closer to the sun  venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid  preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light  it may have had water oceans in the but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse the water has probably photodissociated  and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic venus s surface is a dry desertscape interspersed with slab-like  rocks and is periodically resurfaced by volcanism as one of the brightest objects in the sky  venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as records have existed  it has been made sacred to gods of many cultures  and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the  morning star  and  evening star   venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky  as early as the second millennium the closest planet to earth  venus has been a prime target for early interplanetary exploration  it was the first planet beyond earth visited by a spacecraft  mariner 2  in 1962),  and the first to be successfully landed on  by venera 7  in 1970).  venus s thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light  and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the magellan orbiter in 1991.  plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions  but they are hindered by venus s hostile surface conditions venus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the solar system  meaning that it is a rocky body like earth  it is similar to earth in size and mass  and is often described as earth s  sister  or the diameter of venus is 12,103.6  km (7,520.8  mi —only 638.4  km (396.7  mi  less than earth s—and its mass is 81.5%  of earth s  conditions on the venusian surface differ radically from those on earth because its dense atmosphere is 96.5%  carbon dioxide  with most of the remaining 3.5%  being venusian surface was a subject of speculation until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the 20th  century  venera landers in 1975  and 1982  returned images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular the surface was mapped in detail by magellan in 1990–91.  the ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism  and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate that there have been some recent 80%  of the venusian surface is covered by smooth  volcanic plains  consisting of 70%  plains with wrinkle ridges and 10%  smooth or lobate two highland  continents  make up the rest of its surface area  one lying in the planet s northern hemisphere and the other just south of the equator  the northern continent is called ishtar terra after ishtar  the babylonian goddess of love  and is about the size of australia  maxwell montes  the highest mountain on venus  lies on ishtar terra  its peak is 11  km (7  mi  above the venusian average surface the southern continent is called aphrodite terra  after the greek goddess of love  and is the larger of the two highland regions at roughly the size of south america  a network of fractures and faults covers much of this absence of evidence of lava flow accompanying any of the visible calderas remains an enigma  the planet has few impact craters  demonstrating that the surface is relatively young  approximately 300–600  million years venus has some unique surface features in addition to the impact craters  mountains  and valleys commonly found on rocky planets  among these are flat-topped  volcanic features called  farra   which look somewhat like pancakes and range in size from 20  to 50  km (12  to 31  mi  across  and from 100  to 1,000  m (330  to 3,280  ft  high  radial  star-like  fracture systems called  novae   features with both radial and concentric fractures resembling spider webs  known as  arachnoids   and  coronae   circular rings of fractures sometimes surrounded by a depression  these features are volcanic in venusian surface features are named after historical and mythological exceptions are maxwell montes  named after james clerk maxwell  and highland regions alpha regio  beta regio  and ovda regio  the latter three features were named before the current system was adopted by the international astronomical union  the body which oversees planetary longitudes of physical features on venus are expressed relative to its prime meridian  the original prime meridian passed through the radar-bright  spot at the centre of the oval feature eve  located south of alpha after the venera missions were completed  the prime meridian was redefined to pass through the central peak in the crater of the venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity  venus has several times as many volcanoes as earth  and it has 167  large volcanoes that are over 100  km (62  mi  across  the only volcanic complex of this size on earth is the big island of this is not because venus is more volcanically active than earth  but because its crust is older  earth s oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plates  and has an average age of about 100  million whereas the venusian surface is estimated to be 300–600  million years lines of evidence point to ongoing volcanic activity on venus  during the soviet venera program  the venera 9  orbiter obtained spectroscopic evidence of lightning on and the venera 12  descent probe obtained additional evidence of lightning and the european space agency s venus express in 2007  detected whistler waves further confirming the occurrence of lightning on one possibility is that ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning  another piece of evidence comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere  which dropped by a factor of 10  between 1978  and 1986,  jumped in 2006,  and again declined this may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic 2008  and 2009,  the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was observed by venus express  in the form of four transient localized infrared hot spots within the rift zone ganis 1]  near the shield volcano maat mons  three of the spots were observed in more than one successive orbit  these spots are thought to represent lava freshly released by volcanic the actual temperatures are not known  because the size of the hot spots could not be measured  but are likely to have been in the 800–1,100  k (527–827  °c  980–1,520  °f  range  relative to a normal temperature of 740  k (467  °c  872  a thousand impact craters on venus are evenly distributed across its surface  on other cratered bodies  such as earth and the moon  craters show a range of states of degradation  on the moon  degradation is caused by subsequent impacts  whereas on earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion  on venus  about 85%  of the craters are in pristine condition  the number of craters  together with their well-preserved  condition  indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600  million years followed by a decay in whereas earth s crust is in continuous motion  venus is thought to be unable to sustain such a process  without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle  venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust  then  over a period of about 100  million years  subduction occurs on an enormous scale  completely recycling the craters range from 3  to 280  km (2  to 174  mi  in diameter  no craters are smaller than 3  km  because of the effects of the dense atmosphere on incoming objects  objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed down so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact incoming projectiles less than 50  m (160  ft  in diameter will fragment and burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the seismic data or knowledge of its moment of inertia  little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of the similarity in size and density between venus and earth suggests they share a similar internal structure  a core  mantle  and crust  like that of earth  the venusian core is at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same the slightly smaller size of venus means pressures are 24%  lower in its deep interior than the principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on venus  possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous  this results in reduced heat loss from the planet  preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic instead  venus may lose its internal heat in periodic major resurfacing has an extremely dense atmosphere composed of 96.5%  carbon dioxide  3.5%  nitrogen  and traces of other gases  most notably sulfur the mass of its atmosphere is 93  times that of earth s  whereas the pressure at its surface is about 92  times that at earth s—a pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly 1  kilometre (0.62  mi  under earth s oceans  the density at the surface is 65  kg/m3,  6.5%  that of water or 50  times as dense as earth s atmosphere at 293  k (20  °c  68  °f  at sea level  the co 2-rich  atmosphere generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the solar system  creating surface temperatures of at least 735  k (462  °c  864  this makes venus s surface hotter than mercury s  which has a minimum surface temperature of 53  k (−220  °c  −364  °f  and maximum surface temperature of 693  k (420  °c  788  even though venus is nearly twice mercury s distance from the sun and thus receives only 25%  of mercury s solar irradiance  this temperature is higher than that used for sterilization  the surface of venus is often said to resemble traditional accounts of have suggested that billions of years ago venus s atmosphere was much more like earth s than it is now  and that there may have been substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface  but after a period of 600  million to several billion a runaway greenhouse effect was caused by the evaporation of that original water  which generated a critical level of greenhouse gases in its although the surface conditions on venus are no longer hospitable to any earthlike life that may have formed before this event  there is speculation on the possibility that life exists in the upper cloud layers of venus  50  km (31  mi  up from the surface  where the temperature ranges between 303  and 353  k (30  and 80  °c  86  and 176  °f  but the environment is inertia and the transfer of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of venus s surface does not vary significantly between the night and day sides  despite venus s extremely slow rotation  winds at the surface are slow  moving at a few kilometres per hour  but because of the high density of the atmosphere at the surface  they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions  and transport dust and small stones across the surface  this alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through  even if the heat  pressure  and lack of oxygen were not a the dense co 2  layer are thick clouds consisting mainly of sulfuric acid droplets  the clouds also contain sulfur aerosol  about 1%  ferric and some other possible constituents of the cloud particles are ferric sulfate  aluminium chloride and phosphoric anhydride  clouds at different levels have different compositions and particle size these clouds reflect and scatter about 90%  of the sunlight that falls on them back into space  and prevent visual observation of venus s surface  the permanent cloud cover means that although venus is closer than earth to the sun  it receives less sunlight on the ground  strong 300  km h (185  mph  winds at the cloud tops go around venus about every four to five earth winds on venus move at up to 60  times the speed of its rotation  whereas earth s fastest winds are only 10–20%  rotation surface of venus is effectively isothermal  it retains a constant temperature not only between day and night sides but between the equator and the venus s minute axial tilt—less than 3°,  compared to 23°  on earth—also minimises seasonal temperature the only appreciable variation in temperature occurs with altitude  the highest point on venus  maxwell montes  is therefore the coolest point on venus  with a temperature of about 655  k (380  °c  715  °f  and an atmospheric pressure of about 4.5  mpa (45  in 1995,  the magellan spacecraft imaged a highly reflective substance at the tops of the highest mountain peaks that bore a strong resemblance to terrestrial snow  this substance likely formed from a similar process to snow  albeit at a far higher temperature  too volatile to condense on the surface  it rose in gaseous form to higher elevations  where it is cooler and could precipitate  the identity of this substance is not known with certainty  but speculation has ranged from elemental tellurium to lead sulfide clouds of venus may be capable of producing the existence of lightning in the atmosphere of venus has been controversial since the first suspected bursts were detected by the soviet venera probes  in 2006–07,  venus express clearly detected whistler mode waves  the signatures of lightning  their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity  according to these measurements  the lightning rate is at least half of that on in 2007,  venus express discovered that a huge double atmospheric vortex exists at the south express also discovered  in 2011,  that an ozone layer exists high in the atmosphere of on 29  january 2013,  esa scientists reported that the ionosphere of venus streams outwards in a manner similar to  the ion tail seen streaming from a comet under similar december 2015  and to a lesser extent in april and may 2016,  researchers working on japan s akatsuki mission observed bow shapes in the atmosphere of venus  this was considered direct evidence of the existence of perhaps the largest stationary gravity waves in the solar 1967,  venera 4  found venus s magnetic field to be much weaker than that of earth  this magnetic field is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar rather than by an internal dynamo as in the earth s core  venus s small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation the lack of an intrinsic magnetic field at venus was surprising  given that it is similar to earth in size  and was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core  a dynamo requires three things  a conducting liquid  rotation  and convection  the core is thought to be electrically conductive and  although its rotation is often thought to be too slow  simulations show it is adequate to produce a this implies that the dynamo is missing because of a lack of convection in venus s core  on earth  convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much hotter than the top  on venus  a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust  this caused the mantle temperature to increase  thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core  as a result  no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field  instead  the heat from the core is being used to reheat the possibility is that venus has no solid inner or that its core is not cooling  so that the entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature  another possibility is that its core has already completely solidified  the state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur  which is unknown at weak magnetosphere around venus means that the solar wind is interacting directly with its outer atmosphere  here  ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation of neutral molecules from ultraviolet radiation  the solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape venus s gravity field  this erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass  hydrogen  helium  and oxygen ions  whereas higher-mass  molecules  such as carbon dioxide  are more likely to be retained  atmospheric erosion by the solar wind probably led to the loss of most of venus s water during the first billion years after it the erosion has increased the ratio of higher-mass  deuterium to lower-mass  hydrogen in the atmosphere 100  times compared to the rest of the solar orbits the sun at an average distance of about 0.72  au (108  million km  67  million mi   and completes an orbit every 224.7  days  although all planetary orbits are elliptical  venus s orbit is the closest to circular  with an eccentricity of less than when venus lies between earth and the sun in inferior conjunction  it makes the closest approach to earth of any planet at an average distance of 41  million km (25  million the planet reaches inferior conjunction every 584  days  on because of the decreasing eccentricity of earth s orbit  the minimum distances will become greater over tens of thousands of years  from the year 1  to 5383,  there are 526  approaches less than 40  million km  then there are none for about 60,158  the planets in the solar system orbit the sun in an anti-clockwise  direction as viewed from above earth s north pole  most planets also rotate on their axes in an anti-clockwise  direction  but venus rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation once every 243  earth days—the slowest rotation of any planet  because its rotation is so slow  venus is very close to a venusian sidereal day thus lasts longer than a venusian year (243  versus 224.7  earth days   venus s equator rotates at 6.52  km h (4.05  mph   whereas earth s rotates at 1,669.8  km h (1,037.6  venus s rotation has slowed down in the 16  years between the magellan spacecraft and venus express visits  each venusian sidereal day has increased by 6.5  minutes in that time because of the retrograde rotation  the length of a solar day on venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day  at 116.75  earth days  making the venusian solar day shorter than mercury s 176  earth one venusian year is about 1.92  venusian solar to an observer on the surface of venus  the sun would rise in the west and set in the although venus s opaque clouds prevent observing the sun from the planet s may have formed from the solar nebula with a different rotation period and obliquity  reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere  a change that would have occurred over the course of billions of years  the rotation period of venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the sun s gravitation  which tends to slow rotation  and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick venusian the 584-day  average interval between successive close approaches to earth is almost exactly equal to 5  venusian solar but the hypothesis of a spin–orbit resonance with earth has been has no natural it has several trojan asteroids  the quasi-satellite  2002  and two other temporary trojans  2001  ck32  and 2012  in the 17th  century  giovanni cassini reported a moon orbiting venus  which was named neith and numerous sightings were reported over the following 7009631152000000000♠200  years  but most were determined to be stars in the vicinity  alex alemi s and david stevenson s 2006  study of models of the early solar system at the california institute of technology shows venus likely had at least one moon created by a huge impact event billions of years about 10  million years later  according to the study  another impact reversed the planet s spin direction and caused the venusian moon gradually to spiral inward until it collided with if later impacts created moons  these were removed in the same way  an alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides  which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial the naked eye  venus appears as a white point of light brighter than any other planet or star  apart from the its brightest apparent magnitude  occurs during crescent phase  only 36  days before or after inferior venus will be brightest on 30  april 2017,  then grow dimmer for nearly a year  venus fades to about magnitude −3  when it is backlit by the the planet is bright enough to be seen in a clear midday and is more easily visible when the sun is low on the horizon or setting  as an inferior planet  it always lies within about 47°  of the  overtakes  earth every 584  days as it orbits the as it does so  it changes from the  evening star   visible after sunset  to the  morning star   visible before sunrise  although mercury  the other inferior planet  reaches a maximum elongation of only 28°  and is often difficult to discern in twilight  venus is hard to miss when it is at its brightest  its greater maximum elongation means it is visible in dark skies long after sunset  as the brightest point-like  object in the sky  venus is a commonly misreported  unidentified flying object  as it orbits the sun  venus displays phases like those of the moon in a telescopic view  the planet appears as a small and  full  disc when it is on the opposite side of the sun  at superior conjunction   venus shows a larger disc and  quarter phase  at its maximum elongations from the sun  and appears its brightest in the night sky  the planet presents a much larger thin  crescent  in telescopic views as it passes along the near side between earth and the sun  venus displays its largest size and  new phase  when it is between earth and the sun  at inferior conjunction   its atmosphere is visible through telescopes by the halo of sunlight refracted around venusian orbit is slightly inclined relative to earth s orbit  thus  when the planet passes between earth and the sun  it usually does not cross the face of the sun  transits of venus occur when the planet s inferior conjunction coincides with its presence in the plane of earth s orbit  transits of venus occur in cycles of 7009766849680000000♠243  years with the current pattern of transits being pairs of transits separated by eight years  at intervals of about 7009332932680000000♠105.5  years or 7009383424840000000♠121.5  years—a pattern first discovered in 1639  by the english astronomer jeremiah latest pair was june 8,  2004  and june 5–6,  2012.  the transit could be watched live from many online outlets or observed locally with the right equipment and preceding pair of transits occurred in december 1874  and december 1882;  the following pair will occur in december 2117  and december the oldest film known is the 1874  passage de venus  showing the 1874  venus transit of the sun  historically  transits of venus were important  because they allowed astronomers to determine the size of the astronomical unit  and hence the size of the solar system as shown by horrocks in captain cook s exploration of the east coast of australia came after he had sailed to tahiti in 1768  to observe a transit of pentagram of venus is the path that venus makes as observed from earth  successive inferior conjunctions of venus repeat very near a 13:8  orbital resonance  earth orbits 8  times for every 13  orbits of venus   shifting 144°  upon sequential inferior conjunctions  the resonance 13:8  ratio is approximate  8/13  is approximately 0.615385  while venus orbits the sun in 0.615187  eye observations of venus during daylight hours exist in several anecdotes and records  astronomer edmund halley calculated its maximum naked eye brightness in 1716,  when many londoners were alarmed by its appearance in the daytime  french emperor napoleon bonaparte once witnessed a daytime apparition of the planet while at a reception in another historical daytime observation of the planet took place during the inauguration of the american president abraham lincoln in washington  d c   on 4  march although naked eye visibility of venus  phases is disputed  records exist of observations of its long-standing  mystery of venus observations is the so-called  ashen light—an apparent weak illumination of its dark side  seen when the planet is in the crescent phase  the first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643,  but the existence of the illumination has never been reliably confirmed  observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the venusian atmosphere  but it could be illusory  resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright  crescent-shaped  was known to ancient civilizations both as the  morning star  and as the  evening star   names that reflect the early assumption that these were two separate objects  the ancient sumerians  who recognized venus as a single believed that it was their goddess inanna s movements in several of her myths  including inanna and shukaletuda and inanna s descent into the underworld appear to parallel the motion of the planet the venus tablet of ammisaduqa  believed to have been compiled around the mid-seventeenth  century shows the babylonians understood the two were a single object  referred to in the tablet as the  bright queen of the sky   and could support this view with detailed ancient greeks thought that venus was two separate stars  phosphorus and hesperus  pliny the elder credited the realization that they were a single object to pythagoras in the sixth century while diogenes laertius argued that parmenides was probably the ancient chinese referred to the morning venus as  the great white  (tai-bai  太白  or  the opener  starter  of brightness  (qi-ming  啟明   and the evening venus as  the excellent west one  (chang-geng  長庚   the romans designated the morning aspect of venus as lucifer  literally "light-bringer",  and the evening aspect as vesper  both literal translations of the respective greek names in the second century  in his astronomical treatise almagest  ptolemy theorized that both mercury and venus are located between the sun and the earth  the 11th  century persian astronomer avicenna claimed to have observed the transit of which later astronomers took as confirmation of ptolemy s in the 12th  century  the andalusian astronomer ibn bajjah observed  two planets as black spots on the face of the sun   which were later identified as the transits of venus and mercury by the maragha astronomer qotb al-din  shirazi in the 13th  2]when  the italian physicist galileo galilei first observed the planet in the early 17th  century  he found it showed phases like the moon  varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa  when venus is furthest from the sun in the sky  it shows a half-lit  phase  and when it is closest to the sun in the sky  it shows as a crescent or full phase  this could be possible only if venus orbited the sun  and this was among the first observations to clearly contradict the ptolemaic geocentric model that the solar system was concentric and centred on 1639  transit of venus was accurately predicted by jeremiah horrocks and observed by him and his friend  william crabtree  at each of their respective homes  on 4  december 1639  (24  november under the julian calendar in use at that atmosphere of venus was discovered in 1761  by russian polymath mikhail venus s atmosphere was observed in 1790  by german astronomer johann schröter  schröter found when the planet was a thin crescent  the cusps extended through more than 180°.  he correctly surmised this was due to scattering of sunlight in a dense atmosphere  later  american astronomer chester smith lyman observed a complete ring around the dark side of the planet when it was at inferior conjunction  providing further evidence for an the atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet  and observers such as italian-born  astronomer giovanni cassini and schröter incorrectly estimated periods of about 7004864000000000000♠24  h from the motions of markings on the planet s apparent more was discovered about venus until the 20th  century  its almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like  and it was only with the development of spectroscopic  radar and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed  the first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s,  when frank e  ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation  he suggested this was due to a dense  yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above observations in the 1900s  gave the first clues about the venusian rotation  vesto slipher tried to measure the doppler shift of light from venus  but found he could not detect any rotation  he surmised the planet must have a much longer rotation period than had previously been later work in the 1950s  showed the rotation was retrograde  radar observations of venus were first carried out in the 1960s,  and provided the first measurements of the rotation period  which were close to the modern observations in the 1970s  revealed details of the venusian surface for the first time  pulses of radio waves were beamed at the planet using the 300  m (980  ft  radio telescope at arecibo observatory  and the echoes revealed two highly reflective regions  designated the alpha and beta regions  the observations also revealed a bright region attributed to mountains  which was called maxwell these three features are now the only ones on venus that do not have female first robotic space probe mission to venus  and the first to any planet  began with the soviet venera program in the united states  exploration of venus had its first success with the mariner 2  mission on 14  december 1962,  becoming the world s first successful interplanetary mission  passing 34,833  km (21,644  mi  above the surface of venus  and gathering data on the planet s 18  october 1967,  the soviet venera 4  successfully entered the atmosphere and deployed science experiments  venera 4  showed the surface temperature was hotter than mariner 2  had calculated  at almost 500  °c  determined that the atmosphere is 95%  carbon dioxide  co 2),  and discovered that venus s atmosphere was considerably denser than venera 4's  designers had the joint venera 4–mariner  5  data were analysed by a combined soviet–american science team in a series of colloquia over the following in an early example of space 1974,  mariner 10  swung by venus on its way to mercury and took ultraviolet photographs of the clouds  revealing the extraordinarily high wind speeds in the venusian atmosphere in 1975,  the soviet venera 9  and 10  landers transmitted the first images from the surface of venus  which were in black and white  in 1982  the first colour images of the surface were obtained with the soviet venera 13  and 14  landers nasa obtained additional data in 1978  with the pioneer venus project that consisted of two separate pioneer venus orbiter and pioneer venus the successful soviet venera program came to a close in october 1983,  when venera 15  and 16  were placed in orbit to conduct detailed mapping of 25%  of venus s terrain  from the north pole to 30°n  other venus flybys took place in the 1980s  and 1990s  that increased the understanding of venus  including vega 1  (1985),  vega 2  (1985),  galileo (1990),  magellan (1994),  cassini–huygens (1998),  and messenger (2006).  then  venus express by the european space agency  esa  entered orbit around venus in april 2006.  equipped with seven scientific instruments  venus express provided unprecedented long-term  observation of venus s atmosphere  esa concluded that mission in december 2014.as  of 2016,  japan s akatsuki is in a highly elliptical orbit around venus since 7  december 2015,  and there are several probing proposals under study by roscosmos  nasa  and india s isro in 2016,  nasa announced that it was planning a rover  the automaton rover for extreme environments  designed to survive for an extended time in venus  environmental conditions  it would be controlled by a mechanical computer and driven by wind is a primary feature of the night sky  and so has been of remarkable importance in mythology  astrology and fiction throughout history and in different cultures  classical poets such as homer  sappho  ovid and virgil spoke of the star and its romantic poets such as william blake  robert frost  alfred lord tennyson and william wordsworth wrote odes to with the invention of the telescope  the idea that venus was a physical world and possible destination began to take form the impenetrable venusian cloud cover gave science fiction writers free rein to speculate on conditions at its surface  all the more so when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to earth  it possessed a substantial atmosphere  closer to the sun than earth  the planet was frequently depicted as warmer  but still habitable by the genre reached its peak between the 1930s  and 1950s,  at a time when science had revealed some aspects of venus  but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions  findings from the first missions to venus showed the reality to be quite different  and brought this particular genre to an as scientific knowledge of venus advanced  so science fiction authors tried to keep pace  particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform the astronomical symbol for venus is the same as that used in biology for the female sex  a circle with a small cross the venus symbol also represents femininity  and in western alchemy stood for the metal polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity  and the symbol for venus has sometimes been understood to stand for the mirror of the speculation of the existence of life on venus decreased significantly since the early 1960s,  when spacecraft began studying venus and it became clear that the conditions on venus are extreme compared to those on earth the fact that venus is located closer to the sun than earth  raising temperatures on the surface to nearly 735  k (462  °c  863  °f   the atmospheric pressure is ninety times that of earth  and the extreme impact of the greenhouse effect  make water-based  life as we know it unlikely  a few scientists have speculated that thermoacidophilic extremophile microorganisms might exist in the lower-temperature,  acidic upper layers of the venusian the atmospheric pressure and temperature fifty kilometres above the surface are similar to those at earth s surface  this has led to proposals to use aerostats (lighter-than-air  balloons  for initial exploration and ultimately for permanent  floating cities  in the
