 subtropics -  wikipediathe subtropics are geographic and climate zones located roughly between the tropics at latitude 23.5°   the tropic of cancer and tropic of capricorn  and temperate zones  normally referring to latitudes 35–66.5°)  north and south of the equator subtropical climates are often characterized by warm to hot summers and cool to mild winters with infrequent frost  most subtropical climates fall into two basic types -  humid subtropical  where rainfall is often concentrated in the warmest months  for example brisbane or jacksonville  florida  and dry summer  or mediterranean   where seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the cooler months  for example naples  italy or los angeles  california  subtropical climates can occur at high elevations within the tropics  such as in the southern end of the mexican plateau and in vietnam and taiwan  six climate classifications use the term to help define the various temperature and precipitation regimes for the planet earth a great portion of the world s deserts are located within the subtropics  due to the development of the subtropical ridge  within savanna regimes in the subtropics  a wet season is seen annually during the summer  which is when most of the yearly rainfall falls  within mediterranean climate regimes  the wet season occurs during the winter  areas bordering warm oceans are prone to locally heavy rainfall from tropical cyclones  which can contribute a significant percentage of the annual rainfall  plants such as palms  citrus  mango  pistachio  lychee  and avocado are grown within the subtropics the tropics have been historically defined as lying between the tropic of cancer and tropic of capricorn  located at 23.45°  north and south latitude the poleward fringe of the subtropics is located at approximately 40°  north and south latitude methods have been used to define the subtropical climate  in the trewartha climate classification  a subtropical region should have at least eight months with a mean temperature greater than 10  °c (50.0  °f  and at least one month with a mean temperature under 18  °c (64.4  german climatologists carl troll and karlheinz paffen defined warm temperate zones as plain and hilly lands having an average temperature of the coldest month between 2  °c (35.6  °f  and 13  °c (55.4  °f  in the northern hemisphere and between 6  °c (42.8  °f  and 13  °c (55.4  °f  in the southern hemisphere  excluding oceanic and continental climates  according to the troll-paffen  climate classification  there generally exists one large subtropical zone named the warm-temperate  subtropical which is subdivided into seven smaller to the e  neef climate classification  the subtropical zone is divided into two parts  rainy winters of the west sides and eastern subtropical according to the wilhelm lauer   peter frankenberg climate classification  the subtropical zone is divided into three parts  high-continental,  continental  and according to the siegmund frankenberg climate classification  subtropical is one of six climate zones in the of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone  the upper-level  divergence over the near-equatorial  trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft  as the air moves towards the mid-latitudes,  it cools and sinks  which leads to subsidence near the 30th  parallel of both hemispheres  this circulation is known as the hadley cell and leads to the formation of the subtropical many of the world s deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure  located within the subtropics  this regime is known as an arid subtropical climate  which is generally located in areas adjacent to powerful cold ocean currents  examples of this climate are the coastal areas of southern africa  namibia  south africa   the south of the canary islands and the coasts of peru and humid or monsoon subtropical climate is often located on the western side of the subtropical high  here  unstable tropical airmasses in summer bring convective overturning and frequent tropical downpours in the hot season  in the winter  dry season  the monsoon retreats  and the drier trade winds bring more stable airmass and often dry weather  areas that have this type of subtropical climate include australia  southeast asia  parts of south america  and the deep south of the united monsoon regions with a wet season include western the desert southwest of the united within the mediterranean climate regime  the west coast of the united states and the mediterranean coastline of italy  and turkey experience a wet season in the winter similarly  the wet season in the negev desert of israel extends from october through at the boundary between the mediterranean and monsoon climates in north america lies the sonoran desert  which receives the two rainy seasons associated with each climate areas bounded by warm ocean  tropical cyclones can contribute significantly to local rainfall within the japan receives over half of its rainfall from climates do not routinely see hard frosts or snow  which allows plants such as palms and citrus to as one moves toward the tropical side the slight winter cool season disappears  while at the poleward threshold of the subtropics the winters become cooler  some crops which have been traditionally farmed in tropical climates  such as mango  litchi  and avocado  are cultivated in the subtropics  pest control of the crops is less difficult than within the tropics  due to the cooler ferns  pteridophytes  are grown within subtropical areas  primarily within the subtropics and within topography within the tropics  dracaena and yucca can grow within the subtropics  trees within the taxaceae family grow within subtropical climate regimes  apple  pear pomegranate grows well humid subtropical climate is a subtropical climate type characterized by hot  humid summers with frequent tropical downpours of short duration and warm  and frequently dry winters  in summer  the subtropical high pressure cells bring a sultry flow of tropical air with high dew points  and daily thundershowers are typical  though brief  normally  rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months of the year  at times  the average annual precipitation may be more evenly distributed throughout the year  or a spring maximum is present  with decreasing latitude most humid subtropical climates have drier winters and wetter summers typically  such as the usa state of florida and southeast asia humid subtropical climates lie on the lower east side of continents  roughly between latitudes 25°  and 40°  degrees away from the mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the mediterranean basin  parts of coastal southwestern north america  parts of western and south australia  in southwestern south africa and in parts of central chile  the climate is characterized by hot dry summers and rainfall in in areas under the constant influence of the subtropical ridge  inland from the immediate coastlines  mediterranean climates can take on extreme temperatures  this is seen in inland california as well as andalusia in spain  in europe  the northernmost mediterranean climates are found along the french riviera  located at 43°  latitude  on the immediate atlantic coastline  the mediterranean boundary goes between porto and vigo at around 41°  latitude  parts of southwestern australia around perth have a mediterranean climate as does areas around coastal south africa arid subtropical climates are characterized by an annual average temperature above 18  °c (64.4  °f   the absence of regular rainfall and high humidity  mild climate variants are generally located in areas adjacent to powerful cold ocean currents  examples of this climate  the coastal areas of southern africa  namibia  south africa   south of the canary islands and the coasts of peru and chile
