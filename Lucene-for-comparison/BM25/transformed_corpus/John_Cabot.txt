 john cabot -  wikipediajohn cabot  italian  giovanni caboto  venetian  zuan chabotto  c  1450  – c  1500)  was a venetian navigator and explorer whose 1497  discovery of the coast of north america under the commission of henry vii of england was the first european exploration of the mainland of north america since the norse visits to vinland in the eleventh century  to mark the celebration of the 500th  anniversary of cabot s expedition  both the canadian and british governments elected cape bonavista  newfoundland  as cabot s first landing site  however  alternative locations have also been proposed cabot is known today as giovanni caboto in italian  as zuan chabotto in venetian  as john cabot in english  as jean cabot in french  and as juan caboto in spanish  the non-italian  forms are derived from how his name was recorded in related 15th-century  documents  in venice he signed his names as  zuan chabotto   zuan being a form of john typical to he continued to use this form in england  at least among italians  he was referred to by his italian banker in london as  giovanni chabbote   in the only known contemporary document to use this version of his first was born in italy  the son of giulio caboto and his wife  he had a brother gaeta  in the province of latina  and castiglione chiavarese  in the province of genoa  have both been proposed as the main evidence for gaeta are records of a caboto family residing there until the mid-15th  century  but ceasing to be traceable after de ayala  the spanish envoy and cabot s contemporary in london  described him in a letter to the spanish crown in 1498  as  another genoese like john cabot s son  sebastian  said his father originally came from genoa  in 1476  cabot was made a citizen of the republic of venice  which required a minimum of fifteen years  residency in the city  thus he must have lived in venice since at least may have been born slightly earlier than 1450,  which is the approximate date most commonly given for his in 1471  caboto was accepted into the religious confraternity of st john the evangelist  since this was one of the city s prestigious confraternities  his acceptance suggests that he was already a respected member of the community following his gaining full venetian citizenship in 1476,  caboto would have been eligible to engage in maritime trade  including the trade to the eastern mediterranean that was the source of much of venice s wealth  he presumably entered this trade shortly thereafter  a 1483  document refers to his selling a slave in crete whom he had acquired while in the territories of the sultan of egypt  which then comprised most of what is now israel  syria and this is not sufficient to prove cabot s later assertion that he had visited mecca  which he said in 1497  to the milanese ambassador in in this mediterranean trade  he may have acquired better knowledge of the origins of the oriental  west asian  merchandise he would have been dealing in  such as spices and silks  than most europeans at that time  zuan cabotto   i e  john cabot  is mentioned in a variety of venetian records of the 1480s.  these indicate that by 1484  he was married to mattea and already had at least two cabot s sons are ludovico  sebastian  and the venetian sources contain references to cabot s being involved in house building in the city  he may have relied on this experience when seeking work later in spain as a civil appears to have got into financial trouble in the late 1480s  and left venice as an insolvent debtor by 5  november 1488.  he moved to valencia  spain  where his creditors attempted to have him arrested by sending a lettera di raccomandazione a giustizia   a letter of recommendation to justice   to the while in valencia   john cabot montecalunya   as he is referred to in local documents  proposed plans for improvements to the harbour  these proposals were rejected  early in 1494  he moved on to seville  where he proposed  was contracted to build and  for five months  worked on the construction of a stone bridge over the guadalquivir river  this project was abandoned following a decision of the city council on 24  december after this cabot appears to have sought support in seville and lisbon for an atlantic expedition  before moving to london to seek funding and political he likely reached england in mid-1495.like  other italian explorers  including christopher columbus  cabot led an expedition on commission to another european nation  in his case  england  cabot planned to depart to the west from a northerly latitude where the longitudes are much closer together  and where  as a result  the voyage would be much he still had an expectation of finding an alternative route to china historians had thought that  on arrival in england  cabot went to bristol  a major maritime centre  to seek financial this was the only english city to have had a history of undertaking exploratory expeditions into the atlantic  cabot s royal patent  issued by the crown in 1496)  stated that all expeditions should be undertaken from bristol  so his primary financial supporters likely were based in that city  in any case  it also stipulated that the commerce resulting from any discoveries must be conducted with england the late 20th  century  british historian alwyn ruddock claimed to have found documentation that cabot went first to london  where he received some financial backing from its italian community  she suggested one patron was father giovanni antonio de carbonariis  an augustinian friar who was also the deputy to adriano castellesi  the papal tax collector  ruddock suggested that carbonariis accompanied cabot s 1498  expedition  she also suggested that the friar  on good terms with the king  introduced the explorer to king henry vii  beyond this  ruddock claimed that cabot received a loan from an italian banking house in london  as ruddock ordered the destruction of all her research notes on her death in 2005,  scholars have had to duplicate her research and rediscover the cabot project was formed at the university of bristol in 2009  to research cabot and the bristol expeditions  francesco guidi bruscoli  university of florence  found some of ruddock s documentation  confirming that cabot received money in march 1496  from the bardi family banking firm of the bankers located in london provided fifty nobles (£16  13s.  4d.)  to support cabot s expedition to  go and find the new land   this payment from the florentine merchants would have represented a substantial contribution  although it was not enough to completely finance the 5  march 1496  henry vii gave cabot and his three sons letters patent with the following charge for exploration    free authority  faculty and power to sail to all parts  regions and coasts of the eastern  western and northern sea  under our banners  flags and ensigns  with five ships or vessels of whatsoever burden and quality they may be  and with so many and with such mariners and men as they may wish to take with them in the said ships  at their own proper costs and charges  to find  discover and investigate whatsoever islands  countries  regions or provinces of heathens and infidels  in whatsoever part of the world placed  which before this time were unknown to all those who received such patents had the right to assign them to third parties for his sons are believed to have still been went to bristol to arrange preparations for his voyage  bristol was the second-largest  seaport in england  from 1480  onward it had supplied several expeditions to look for hy-brazil.  according to celtic legend  this island lay somewhere in the atlantic there was widespread belief among merchants in the port that bristol men had discovered the island at earlier date but then lost track of note  ruddock had contended in a private 1988  letter to a colleague  quinn  that she had found evidence in italian archives that bristol men had discovered north america pre-1470.  as the island was believed to be a source of brazilwood  from which a valuable red dye could be obtained   merchants had economic incentive to find first voyage was little recorded  a winter 1497/98  letter from john day  a bristol merchant  to an addressee believed to be christopher columbus refers briefly to it  but writes mostly about the second  1497  voyage  he notes   since your lordship wants information relating to the first voyage  here is what happened  he went with one ship  his crew confused him  he was short of supplies and ran into bad weather  and he decided to turn since cabot received his royal patent in march 1496,  it is believed that he made his first voyage that summer information about the 1497  voyage comes mostly from four short letters and an entry in a 1565  chronicle of the city of bristol  the chronicle entry for 1496/7  says in full  this year  on st  john the baptist s day june 1497],  the land of america was found by the merchants of bristow in a shippe of bristowe  called the mathew  the which said the ship departed from the port of bristowe  the second day of may  and came home again the 6th  of august next following   – g e  weare  cabot s discovery of north america   london  1897),  p  116what  is known as the  john day letter  provides considerable information about cabot s second voyage  it was written during the winter of 1497/8  by bristol merchant john day  alias hugh say of london  to a man who is likely christopher day is believed to have been familiar with the key figures of the expedition and thus able to report on if the lands cabot had discovered lay west of the meridian laid down in the treaty of tordesillas  or if he intended to sail further west  columbus would likely have believed that these voyages challenged his monopoly rights for westward addition to these letters  dr alwyn ruddock claimed to have found another  written on 10  august 1497  by the london-based  bankers of fr  giovanni antonio de carbonariis  this letter has yet to be found  from various written comments made by ruddock  the letter did not appear to contain a detailed account of the ruddock said the letter contained  new evidence supporting the claim that seamen of bristol had already discovered land across the ocean before john cabot s arrival in she contended that bristol seamen had reached north america two decades before cabot s known sources do not concur on all aspects of the events  and none can be assumed to be entirely reliable  cabot was described as having one  little of 50  tons burden  called the matthew of bristol  according to the 1565  chronicle   it was said to be laden with sufficient supplies for  seven or eight the ship departed in may with a crew of to 20  they included an unnamed burgundian (modern-  day netherlands  and a genoese who presumably accompanied the expedition as the ship s surgeon it is likely that two ranking bristol merchants were part of the one was probably william weston  who had not been identified as part of cabot s expedition before the find of a new document in the late 20th  century  his participation was confirmed by a document found in the early 21st  century noting his reward from the king in january 1498  after the ship returned  more importantly  in 2009  historian evan jones confirmed that weston had undertaken an independent voyage to the new found land in 1499,  probably under cabot s patent  as the first englishman to lead an expedition to north bristol  the expedition sailed past ireland and across the atlantic  making landfall somewhere on the coast of north america on 24  june 1497.  the exact location of the landfall has long been disputed  with different communities vying for the honor  historians have proposed cape bonavista and st  john s (present-day  newfoundland   cape breton island  nova scotia   as well as labrador  canada  and maine  united states  as possibilities  since the discovery of the  john day letter  in the 1950s,  it seems most likely that the initial landfall was either on newfoundland or cape breton island  this is because day s letter implies that the coastline explored in 1497  lay between the latitudes of the bordeaux river in france and dursey head in southern ireland  the initial landfall seems to have taken place close to the southern latitude  with the expedition returning home after reaching the northern the 500th-anniversary  celebrations  the governments of canada and the united kingdom designated cape bonavista in newfoundland as the  official  landing place  here in 1997  queen elizabeth ii  along with members of the italian and canadian governments  greeted the replica matthew of bristol  following its celebratory crossing of the cabot s expedition is believed to be the first by europeans to mainland north america since the vikings five hundred years before cabot is reported to have landed only once during the expedition and did not advance  beyond the shooting distance of a pasqualigo and day both state that the expedition made no contact with any native people  crew found the remains of a fire  a human trail  nets and a wooden tool  the crew appeared to have remained on land just long enough to take on fresh water  they also raised the venetian and papal banners  claiming the land for the king of england and recognising the religious authority of the roman catholic after this landing  cabot spent some weeks  discovering the coast   with most  discovered after turning return to bristol  cabot rode to london to report to the king  on 10  august 1497,  he was given a reward of £10  – equivalent to about two years  pay for an ordinary labourer or the explorer was feted  soncino wrote on 23  august that cabot  is called the great admiral as christopher columbus had been  and vast honour is paid to him and he goes dressed in silk  and these english run after him like such adulation was short-lived,  for over the next few months the king s attention was occupied by the second cornish uprising of 1497,  led by perkin warbeck  once henry s throne was secure  he gave more thought to cabot  on 26  september  just a few days after the collapse of the revolt  the king made an award of £2  to in december 1497  the explorer was awarded a pension of £20  per year  on february 3,  1498  he was given new letters patent covering the and to help him prepare a second in march and april  the king also advanced a number of loans to lancelot thirkill of london  thomas bradley and john cair  who were to accompany cabot s new great chronicle of london (1189–1512)  reports that cabot departed with a fleet of five ships from bristol at the beginning of may 1498,  one of which had been prepared by the king  some of the ships were said to be carrying merchandise  including cloth  caps  lace points and other this suggests that cabot intended to engage in trade on this expedition  the spanish envoy in london reported in july that one of the ships had been caught in a storm and been forced to land in ireland  but that cabot and the other four ships had continued centuries no other records were found  or at least published  that relate to this expedition  it was long believed that cabot and his fleet were lost at sea  but at least one of the men scheduled to accompany the expedition  lancelot thirkill of london  is recorded as living in london in historian alwyn ruddock worked on cabot and his era for 35  years  she suggested that cabot and his expedition successfully returned to england in the spring of 1500.  she claimed their return followed an epic two-year  exploration of the east coast of north america  south into the chesapeake bay area and perhaps as far as the spanish territories in the caribbean  her evidence included the well-known  world map of the spanish cartographer juan de la cosa  his chart included the north american coast and seas  discovered by the english  between 1497  and suggested fr  giovanni antonio de carbonariis and the other friars who accompanied the 1498  expedition had stayed in newfoundland and founded a mission  if carbonariis founded a settlement in north america  it would have been the first christian settlement on the continent  and may have included a church  the only medieval church to have been built cabot project at the university of bristol was organized in 2009  to search for the evidence on which ruddock s claims rest  as well as to undertake related studies of cabot and his the lead researchers on the project  evan jones and margaret condon  claim to have found further evidence to support aspects of ruddock s case  including some of the information she intended to use to argue for a successful return of the 1498  expedition to bristol  these appear to place john cabot in london by may 1500,  albeit jones and condon have yet to publish their documentation the project is collaborating on an archaeological excavation at the community of carbonear  newfoundland  located at conception bay and believed the likely location for carbonariis  mission settlement  the archaeology of historic carbonear project  carried out by memorial university of newfoundland  has conducted summer fieldwork each season since 2011.  so far  it has found evidence of planter habitation since the late 17th  century and of trade with spain through bilbao  including a spanish coin minted in circumstances of cabot s death appear obscure and contradictory  he was last mentioned as a member of an expedition led by his son sebastian in 1508-1509.  nothing is known about cabot after that  perhaps he died during the journey  or more likely shortly after claimed that william weston of bristol  a supporter of cabot  undertook an independent expedition to north america in 1499,  sailing north from newfoundland up to the hudson if correct  this was probably the first north west passage expedition  in 2009,  jones confirmed that william weston  who was not previously known to have been involved  led an expedition from bristol royal support  to the  new found land  in 1499  or 1500,  making him the first englishman to lead exploration of north america  this find has changed the understanding of english roles in exploration of that henry vii continued to support exploration from bristol  the king granted hugh eliot  robert thorne and his son a bounty of ₤20  in january 1502  for purchasing the gabriel  a ship for an expedition voyage that summer  later in 1502  or early 1503  he paid eliot a reward of ₤100  for a voyage  or voyages  in "2  ships to the isle of new finding   as newfoundland was called  this amount was larger than any previously accounted for in royal support of the married mattea around 1470,  and had issue including three sons sebastian cabot  one of john s sons  also became an explorer  later making at least one voyage to north america  in 1508  he was searching for the northwest passage  nearly two decades later  he sailed to south america for spain to repeat ferdinand magellan s voyage around the world  he became diverted by searching for silver along the río de la plata (1525–8)  in
