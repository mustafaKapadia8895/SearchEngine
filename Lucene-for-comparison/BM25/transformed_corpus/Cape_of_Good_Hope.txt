 cape of good hope -  wikipediathe cape of good hope  afrikaans  kaap die goeie hoop di ˌχujə ˈɦʊəp   dutch  kaap de goede hoop də ˌɣudə ˈɦoːp    portuguese  cabo da boa esperança dɐ ˈboɐ ʃpɨˈɾɐ̃sɐ   is a rocky headland on the atlantic coast of the cape peninsula  south africa a common misconception is that the cape of good hope is the southern tip of africa  this misconception was based on the misbelief that the cape was the dividing point between the atlantic and indian oceans  contemporary scientific knowledge instead states the southernmost point of africa is cape agulhas about 150  kilometres (90  mi  to the the currents of the two oceans meet at the point where the warm-water  agulhas current meets the cold water benguela current and turns back on itself  that oceanic meeting point fluctuates between cape agulhas and cape point  about 1.2  kilometres (0.75  mi  east of the cape of good hope  when following the western side of the african coastline from the equator  however  the cape of good hope marks the point where a ship begins to travel more eastward than southward  thus  the first modern rounding of the cape in 1488  by portuguese explorer bartolomeu dias was a milestone in the attempts by the portuguese to establish direct trade relations with the far east  although herodotus mentioned a claim that the phoenicians had done so far dias called the cape cabo das tormentas   cape of storms   dutch  stormkaap   which was the original name of the  cape of good one of the great capes of the south atlantic ocean  the cape of good hope has long been of special significance to sailors  many of whom refer to it simply as  the it is a waypoint on the cape route and the clipper route followed by clipper ships to the far east and australia  and still followed by several offshore yacht races the term cape of good hope is also used in three other ways eudoxus of cyzicus   ˈjuːdəksəs   greek  εὔδοξος  eúdoxos  fl  c  130  bc  was a greek navigator for ptolemy viii  king of the hellenistic ptolemaic dynasty in egypt  who found the wreck of a ship in the indian ocean that appeared to have come from gades  today s cádiz in spain   rounding the cape when eudoxus was returning from his second voyage to india the wind forced him south of the gulf of aden and down the coast of africa for some distance  somewhere along the coast of east africa  he found the remains of the ship  due to its appearance and the story told by the natives  eudoxus concluded that the ship was from gades and had sailed anti-clockwise  around africa  passing the cape and entering the indian ocean  this inspired him to repeat the voyage and attempt a circumnavigation of the continent  organising the expedition on his own account he set sail from gades and began to work down the african coast  the difficulties were too great  however  and he was obliged to return to this failure he again set out to circumnavigate africa  his eventual fate is unknown  although some  such as pliny  claimed that eudoxus did achieve his goal  the most probable conclusion is that he perished on the the 1450  fra mauro map  the indian ocean is depicted as connected to the atlantic  fra mauro puts the following inscription by the southern tip of africa  which he names the  cape of diab   describing the exploration by a ship from the east around 1420  a ship  or junk  from india crossed the sea of india towards the island of men and the island of women  off cape diab  between the green islands and the shadows  it sailed for 40  days in a south-westerly  direction without ever finding anything other than wind and water  according to these people themselves  the ship went some 2,000  miles ahead until -  once favourable conditions came to an end -  it turned round and sailed back to cape diab in 70  days   the ships called junks  lit   zonchi   that navigate these seas carry four masts or more  some of which can be raised or lowered  and have 40  to 60  cabins for the merchants and only one tiller  they can navigate without a compass  because they have an astrologer  who stands on the side and  with an astrolabe in hand  gives orders to the navigator    text from the fra mauro map  09-p25.)fra  mauro explained that he obtained the information from  a trustworthy source   who traveled with the expedition  possibly the venetian explorer niccolò da conti who happened to be in calicut  india at the time the expedition left  what is more  i have spoken with a person worthy of trust  who says that he sailed in an indian ship caught in the fury of a tempest for 40  days out in the sea of india  beyond the cape of soffala and the green islands towards west-southwest;  and according to the astrologers who act as their guides  they had advanced almost 2,000  miles  thus one can believe and confirm what is said by both these and those  and that they had therefore sailed 4,000  miles  fra mauro also comments that the account of the expedition  together with the relation by strabo of the travels of eudoxus of cyzicus from arabia to gibraltar through the southern ocean in antiquity  led him to believe that the indian ocean was not a closed sea and that africa could be circumnavigated by her southern end  text from fra mauro map  11,  g2).  this knowledge  together with the map depiction of the african continent  probably encouraged the portuguese to intensify their effort to round the tip of africa in the early modern era  the first european to reach the cape was the portuguese explorer bartolomeu dias on 12  march 1488,  who named it the  cape of storms   cabo das tormentas   it was later renamed by john ii of portugal as  cape of good hope   cabo da boa esperança  because of the great optimism engendered by the opening of a sea route to india and the east the khoikhoi people lived in the cape area when the dutch first settled there in 1652.  the khoikhoi had arrived in this area about fifteen hundred years the dutch called hottentots  a term that has now come to be regarded as pejorative dutch colonial administrator jan van riebeeck established a resupply camp for the dutch east india company some 50  km north of the cape in table bay on 6  april 1652  and this eventually developed into cape town  supplies of fresh food were vital on the long journey around africa and cape town became known as  the tavern of the seas  on 31  december 1687  a community of huguenots  french protestants  arrived at the cape of good hope from the netherlands  they had escaped from france and fled to the netherlands to flee religious persecution in france  one example was pierre joubert who came from la motte-d'aigues.  the dutch east india company needed skilled farmers at the cape of good hope and the dutch government saw opportunities to settle huguenots at the cape and sent them there  the cape colony gradually grew over the next 150  years or so until it stretched for hundreds of kilometres to the north and north-east.during  the napoleonic wars  the dutch republic was occupied by the french in 1795.  thus the cape colony became a french vassal and enemy of the british  therefore  the united kingdom invaded and occupied the cape colony that same year  the british relinquished control of the territory in 1803  but returned and reoccupied the colony on 19  january 1806  following the battle of blaauwberg  the dutch ceded the territory to the british in the anglo-dutch  treaty of 1814  the cape was then administered as the colony  and it remained a british colony until it was incorporated into the independent union of south africa in 1910   now known as the republic of south africa  the portuguese government erected two navigational beacons  dias cross and gama cross  to commemorate vasco da gama and bartolomeu dias as explorers who as mentioned were the first explorers to reach the cape  when lined up  the crosses point to whittle rock (34°21′24.63″s  18°28′26.36″e﻿

hope is at the southern tip of the cape peninsula  about 2.3  kilometres (1.4  mi  west and a little south of cape point on the south-east  corner  cape town is about 50  kilometres to the north of the cape  in table bay at the north end of the peninsula  the peninsula forms the western boundary of false bay  geologically  the rocks found at the two capes  and indeed over much of the peninsula  are part of the cape supergroup  and are formed of the same type of sandstones as table mountain itself  both the cape of good hope and cape point offer spectacular scenery  the whole of the southernmost portion of the cape peninsula is a wild  rugged  scenic and generally unspoiled national park the term the cape has also been used in a wider sense  to indicate the area of the european colony centred on cape town  and the later south african province  since 1994,  it has been broken up into three smaller provinces  the western cape  eastern cape and northern cape  parts of the province were also absorbed into the north west with its diverse habitat  ranging from rocky mountain tops to beaches and open sea  the cape of good hope is home to at least 250  species of birds including one of the two mainland colonies of african penguins  bush birds  tend to be rather scarce because of the coarse  scrubby nature of fynbos vegetation  when flowering  however  proteas and ericas attract sunbirds  sugarbirds  and other species in search of nectar  for most of the year  there are more small birds in coastal thicket than in fynbos the cape of good hope section of table mountain national park is home to several species of antelope  bontebok and eland are easily seen  and red hartebeest can be seen in the grazing lawns in smitswinkel flats  grey rhebok are less commonly seen and are scarce  but may be observed along the beach hills at olifantsbos  most visitors are unlikely to ever see either cape grysbok or klipspringer the cape of good hope section is home to four cape mountain zebra  they might be seen by the attentive or lucky visitor  usually in smitswinkel flats there are a wealth of small animals such as lizards  snakes  tortoises and insects  small mammals include rock hyrax  four-striped  grass mouse  water mongoose  cape clawless otter and fallow deer the area offers excellent vantage points for whale watching  the southern right whale is the species most likely to be seen in false bay between june and november  other species are the humpback whale and bryde s whale  seals  dusky dolphins and killer whales have also been seen the strategic position of the cape of good hope between two major ocean currents  ensures a rich diversity of marine life  there is a difference between the sea life west of cape point and that to the east due to the markedly differing sea temperatures the south african marine living resources act is strictly enforced throughout the table mountain national park  and especially in marine protected areas  disturbance or removal of any marine organisms is strictly prohibited between schusters bay and hoek van bobbejaan  but is allowed in other areas during season and with relevant permits chacma baboons  papio ursinus  are the mammals most intimately associated with the cape of good hope  baboons inside the cape of good hope section of the park are a major tourist attraction  there are 11  troops consisting of about 375  individuals throughout the entire cape peninsula  six of these 11  troops either live entirely within the cape of good hope section of the park  or use the section as part of their range  the cape point  kanonkop  klein olifantsbos  and buffels bay troops live entirely inside the cape of good hope section of the park  the groot olifantsbos and plateau road troops range into the park chacma baboons are widely distributed across southern africa and are classified as ″least concern  in the iucn red list of threatened species  however  the south african parks department states in its publication mountains in the sea that the baboon population on the cape is  critically endangered   this is due to habitat loss  genetic isolation  and conflicts with humans  cape baboons have been eliminated from the majority of their range across the cape peninsula  and the cape of good hope section of table mountain national park provides a sanctuary for the troops that live within its boundaries  it provides relative safety from nearby towns  where people have killed many baboons after the baboons raid their houses looking for food  baboons are also frequently injured or killed outside of the park by cars and by electrocution on power lines  inside the park  some management policies such as allowing barbecues and picnics in the baboon home ranges cause detriment to the troops  as they become embroiled in conflicts with guests to the park the cape of good hope is an integral part of the cape floristic kingdom  the smallest but richest of the world s six floral kingdoms  this comprises a treasure trove of 1100  species of indigenous plants  of which a number are endemic  occur naturally nowhere else on earth   the main type of fynbos   fine bush   vegetation at the cape of good hope is peninsula sandstone fynbos  an endangered vegetation type that is endemic to the cape peninsula  coastal hangklip sand fynbos grows on low-lying  alkaline sands and  right by the sea  small patches of cape flats dune strandveld can be fynbos plants include proteas  ericas  heath   and restios  reeds   some of the most striking and well-known  members belong to the proteacae family  of which up to 24  species occur  these include king protea  sugarbush  tree pincushion and golden cone bush  leucadendron laureolum  many popular horticultural plants like pelargoniums  freesias  daisies  lilies and irises also have their origins in fynbos coordinates  34°21′24.63″s  18°28′26.36″e﻿    ﻿34.3568417°s  18.4739889°e﻿    -34.3568417;  18.4739889﻿   cape of
