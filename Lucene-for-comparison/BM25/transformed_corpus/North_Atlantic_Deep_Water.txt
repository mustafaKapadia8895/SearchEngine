 north atlantic deep water -  wikipedianorth atlantic deep water  nadw  is a deep water mass formed in the north atlantic ocean  thermohaline circulation of the world s oceans involves the flow of warm surface waters from the southern hemisphere into the north atlantic  water flowing northward becomes modified through evaporation and mixing with other water masses  leading to increased salinity  when this water reaches the north atlantic it cools and sinks through convection  due to its decreased temperature and increased salinity resulting in increased density  nadw is the outflow of this thick deep layer  which can be detected by its high salinity  high oxygen content  nutrient minima  high and chlorofluorocarbons cfcs are anthropogenic substances that enter the surface of the ocean from gas exchange with the atmosphere  this distinct composition allows its path to be traced as it mixes with circumpolar deep water  cdw   which in turn fills the deep indian ocean and part of the south pacific  nadw and its formation is essential to the atlantic meridional overturning circulation  amoc   which is responsible for transporting large amounts of water  heat  salt  carbon  nutrients and other substances from the tropical atlantic to the mid and high latitude in the conveyor belt model of thermohaline circulation of the world s oceans  the sinking of nadw pulls the waters of the north atlantic drift northward  however  this is almost certainly an oversimplification of the actual relationship between nadw formation and the strength of the gulf stream north atlantic has a temperature of 2-4  °c with a salinity of 34.9-35.0  psu found at a depth between 1500  and 4000m.the  nadw is a complex of several water masses formed by deep convection and also by overflow of dense water across the greenland-iceland-scotland  upper layers are formed by deep open ocean convection during winter  labrador sea water  lsw   formed in the labrador sea can reach depths of 2000  m as dense water sinks downward  classical labrador sea water  clsw  production is dependent on preconditioning of water in the labrador sea from the previous year  and the strength of the north atlantic oscillation  during a positive nao phase  conditions exist for strong winter storms to develop  these storms freshen the surface water  and their winds increase cyclonic flow  which allows denser waters to sink  as a result  the temperature  salinity  and density vary yearly  in some years these conditions do not exist and clsw is not formed  clsw has characteristic potential temperature of 3  °c  salinity of 34.88  psu  and density of another component of lsw is the upper labrador sea water  ulsw   ulsw forms at a density lower than clsw and has a cfc maximum between 1200  and 1500  m in the subtropical north atlantic  eddies of cold less saline ulsw have similar densities of warmer saltier water and flow along the dwbc  but maintain their high cfcs  the ulsw eddies erode rapidly as they mix laterally with this warmer saltier lower waters mass of nadw form from overflow of the greenland-iceland-scotland  ridge  they are iceland-scotland  overflow water  isow  and denmark strait overflow water  dsow   the overflows are a combination of dense arctic ocean water (18%),  modified atlantic water (32%),  and intermediate water from the nordic seas (20%),  that entrain and mix with other water masses  contributing 30%)  as they flow over the greenland-iceland-scotland  the formation of both of these waters involves the conversion of warm salty northward flowing surface waters to cold dense deep waters behind the greenland-iceland-scotland  ridge  water flow from the north atlantic current enters the arctic ocean through the norwegian current which splits into the fram strait and barents sea water from the fram strait recirculates  reaching a density of dsow  sinks  and flows towards the denmark strait  water flowing into the barent sea feeds isow isow enters the eastern north atlantic over the iceland-scotland  ridge through the faeroe bank channel at a depth of 850  m  with some water flowing over the shallower iceland-faeroe  rise  isow has a low cfc concentrations and it has been estimated from these concentrations that isow resides behind the ridge for 45  as the water flows southward at the bottom of the channel  it entrains surrounding water of the eastern north atlantic  and flows to the western north atlantic through the charlie-gibbs  fracture zone  entraining with lsw  this water is less dense than  dsow  and lays above it as it flows cyclonically in the irminger basin dsow is the coldest  densest  and freshest water mass of nadw  dsow formed behind the ridge flows over the denmark strait at a depth of 600m.  the most significant water mass contributing to dsow is arctic intermediate water winter cooling and convection allow aiw to sink and pool behind the denmark strait  upper aiw has a high amount of anthropogenic tracers due its exposure to the atmosphere  aiw s tritium and cfc signature is observed in dsow at the base of the greenland continental slope  this also showed that the dsow flowing 450  km to the south was no older than 2  both the dsow and isow flow around the irminger basin and labrador sea in a deep boundary current  leaving the greenland sea with 2.5  sv its flow increases to 10  sv south of greenland  it is cold and relatively fresh  flowing below 3500  m in the dwbc and spreading inward the deep atlantic basins the southward spread of nadw along the deep western boundary current  dwbc  can be traced by its high oxygen content  high cfcs  and is the major source of upper nadw  ulsw advects southward from the labrador sea in small eddies that mix into the dwbc  a cfc maxima associated with ulsw has been observed along 24°n  in the dwbc at 1500  some of the upper ulsw recirculates into the gulf stream  while some remains in the dwbc  high cfcs in the subtropics indicate recirculation in the subtropics  ulsw that remains in the dwbc dilutes as it moves equatorward  deep convection in the labrador sea during the late 1980s  and early 1990s  resulted in clsw with a lower cfc concentration due to downward mixing  however  convection allowed the cfcs to penetrate further downward to 2000m.  these minimum could be tracked  and were first observed in the subtropics in the early and dsow flow around the irminger basin and dsow entering the dwbc  these are the two lower portions of the nadw  another cfc maximum is seen at 3500  m in the subtropics from the dsow contribution to some of the nadw recirculates with the northern gyre  to the south of the gyre nadw flows under the gulf stream where it continues along the dwbc until it reaches another gyre in the subtropics lower north atlantic deep water  lnadw   originating in the greenland and norwegian seas  brings high salinity  oxygen  and freon concentrations towards to the romanche trench  an equatorial fracture zone in the mid-atlantic  ridge  mar   found at depths around 3,600–4,000  m (11,800–13,100  ft   lnadw flow east through the trench over aabw  the trench being the only opening in the mar where inter-basin  exchange is possible for these two water is believed that north atlantic deep water formation has been dramatically reduced at times during the past  such as during the younger dryas or during heinrich events   and that this might correlate with a decrease in the strength of the gulf stream and the north atlantic drift  in turn cooling the climate of northwestern europe  there is concern that global warming might cause this to happen again  it is also hypothesized that during the last glacial maximum  lgm   nadw was replaced with an analogous watermass that occupied a shallower depth known as glacial north atlantic intermediate water  gnaiw
