 carbonate platform -  wikipediaa carbonate platform is a sedimentary body which possesses topographic relief  and is composed of autochthonous calcareous deposits  wilson  1975).  platform growth is mediated by sessile organisms whose skeletons build up the reef or by organisms  usually microbes  which induce carbonate precipitation through their metabolism  therefore  carbonate platforms can not grow up everywhere  they are not present in places where limiting factors to the life of reef-building  organisms exist  such limiting factors are  among others  light  water temperature  transparency and ph-value.  for example  carbonate sedimentation along the atlantic south american coasts takes place everywhere but at the mouth of the amazon river  because of the intense turbidity of the water there  carannante et al   1988).  spectacular examples of present-day  carbonate platforms are the bahama banks under which the platform is roughly 8  km thick  the yucatan peninsula which is up to 2  km thick  the florida the platform on which the great barrier reef is growing  and the maldive all these carbonate platforms and their associated reefs are confined to tropical today’s reefs are built mainly by scleractinian corals  but in the distant past other organisms  like archaeocyatha  during the cambrian  or extinct cnidaria  tabulata and rugosa  were important reef builders the mineralogic composition of carbonate platforms may be either calcitic or aragonitic  seawater is oversaturated in carbonate  so under certain conditions caco3  precipitation is possible  carbonate precipitation is thermodynamically favoured at high temperature and low pressure  three types of carbonate precipitation are possible  biotically controlled  biotically induced and abiotic  carbonate precipitation is biotically controlled when organisms  such as corals  are present that exploit carbonate dissolved in seawater to build their calcitic or aragonitic skeletons  thus they may develop hard reef structures  biotically induced precipitation takes place outside the cell of the organism  thus carbonate is not directly produced by organisms  but precipitates because of their metabolism  abiotic precipitation involves little or no biological influence the three types of precipitation described above determine different platform geometries  according to these characteristics a classification was created  consisting of three types of carbonate factories  a carbonate factory is the ensemble of the sedimentary environment  the intervening organisms and the precipitation processes that lead to the formation of a carbonate platform  schlager  2005).in  these platforms precipitation is biotically controlled  mostly by autotrophic organisms  organisms that build this kind of platform are mostly corals  green algae  foraminifers and molluscs  these platforms are found only in warm  more than 20°c)  and sunlit waters  high in oxygen and low in nutrients  this means that they are found between 30°  north and 30°  south of the equator  this type of factory is the most widespread today  and is often found fossilised as the name suggests  this type of platform extends its domain to cooler waters and higher latitudes than tropical factories  precipitation is biotically controlled by heterotrophic organisms  sometimes in association with photo-autotrophic  organisms such as red algae  the sea-waters  of these platforms are characterised by a higher amount of nutrients than in tropical factories these platforms are characterised by abiotic precipitation and biotically induced precipitation  they grow in waters high in nutrients and low in oxygen  mud-mound  factories are known only from the fossil record  especially palaeozoic and mesozoic several factors influence the geometry of a carbonate platform  including inherited topography  synsedimentary tectonics  exposition to currents and trade winds  however  the one most important factor is perhaps the type of carbonate factory  thus  cool-water  factories tend to generate ramps  tropical factories usually form high-relief  rimmed platforms and mud-mounds,  mound-shaped  high relief bodies without a clear zone of dip break  the best known platform geometry  however  is that of modern tropical factories  tropical carbonate platforms can be subdivided into three principal sedimentary environments  reef  internal lagoon and slope the reef is that part of a carbonate platform created by essentially in-place,  sessile organisms  today’s reefs are built by hermatypic organisms  the reef is the rigid structure of carbonate platforms and is located between the internal lagoon and the slope  survival of the platform depends on the existence of the reef  because only this part of the platform can build a rigid  wave-resistant  structure  two reef types are distinguished  isolated  as maldives atolls  or epicontinental  as the belize reefs or the florida keys   geologically speaking  reef rocks can be classified as massive boundstones the internal lagoon  as the name suggests  is the part of platform behind the reef  it is characterised by shallow and calm waters  sediments are composed of reef fragments and hard parts of organisms  if the reef is epicontinental there can be also a terrigenous contribution  in some lagoons  e g   the florida bay  green algae produce great volumes of carbonate mud  rocks here are mudstones to grainstones depending on the energy of the environment the slope is the outer part of the platform  connecting the reef with the basin  this area acts as sink for excess carbonate sediment  most of the sediment produced in the lagoon and reef is transported by various processes and accumulates in the slope  therefore  the slope contains coarser sediments than the reef and lagoon  these rocks are generally rudstones or grainstones  sediments have a characteristic geometry  they are organized in clinoforms  clinoforms are beds that have a sigmoidal or tabular shape  but are always deposited with a primary inclination sedimentary sequences show carbonate platforms as old as the precambrian  when they were formed by stromatolitic sequences  in the cambrian carbonate platforms were built by archaeocyatha  metazoa similar to porifera  during paleozoic brachiopod  richtofenida  and stromatoporoidea reefs were erected  at the middle of the paleozoic era corals became important platforms builders  first with tabulata  from the silurian  and then with rugosa  from the devonian   scleractinia become important reef builders beginning only in the carnian  upper triassic   one of the best examples of a carbonate platform is the dolomites  deposited during the triassic  this region of the southern alps contains many well preserved atolls  including the sella  gardenaccia  sassolungo and latemar  the latter being a backstepping type platform  the middle liassic  bahamian type  carbonate platform of morocco
