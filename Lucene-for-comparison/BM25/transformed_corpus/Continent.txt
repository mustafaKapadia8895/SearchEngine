 continent -  wikipediaa continent is one of several very large landmasses of the world  generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria  up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents  ordered from largest in size to smallest  they are  asia  africa  north america  south america  antarctica  europe  and the continents largely correspond to areas of continental crust that are found on the continental plates  however some areas of continental crust are regions covered with water not usually included in the list of continents  the area referred to as zealandia is one such area  see submerged continents below  islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world s land into geopolitical regions  under this scheme  most of the island countries and territories in the pacific ocean are grouped together with the continent of australia to form a geopolitical region called oceania by convention   continents are understood to be large  continuous  discrete masses of land  ideally separated by expanses of several of the seven conventionally recognized continents are not discrete landmasses separated completely by water  the criterion  large  leads to arbitrary classification  greenland  with a surface area of 2,166,086  square kilometres (836,330  sq mi  is considered the world s largest island  while australia  at 7,617,930  square kilometres (2,941,300  sq mi  is deemed the smallest continent earth s major landmasses all have coasts on a single  continuous world ocean  which is divided into a number of principal oceanic components by the continents and various geographic most restricted meaning of continent is that of a area of land or mainland  with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent  in this sense the term continental europe  sometimes referred to in britain as  the continent   is used to refer to mainland europe  excluding islands such as great britain  ireland  malta and iceland  and the term continent of australia may refer to the mainland of australia  excluding tasmania and new guinea  similarly  the continental united states refers to the 48  contiguous states and the district of columbia in central north america and may include alaska in the northwest of the continent  the two being separated by canada   while excluding hawaii  puerto rico  and guam in the oceans from the perspective of geology or physical geography  continent may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow  submerged adjacent area  the continental and the islands on the shelf  continental islands   as they are structurally part of the this perspective the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent  as shorelines vary with changes in sea in this sense the islands of great britain and ireland are part of europe  while australia and the island of new guinea together form a continent as a cultural construct  the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include oceanic islands and continental fragments  in this way  iceland is considered part of europe and madagascar part of africa  extrapolating the concept to its extreme  some geographers group the australian continental plate with other islands in the pacific into one continent called oceania  this divides the entire land surface of earth into continents or ideal criterion that each continent be a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to historical conventions  of the seven most globally recognized continents  only antarctica and australia are completely separated from other continents by ocean  several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as  more or less discrete masses of asia and africa are joined by the isthmus of suez  and north and south america by the isthmus of panama  in both cases  there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water  disregarding the suez canal and panama canal  which are both narrow and shallow  as well as being artificial   both these isthmuses are very narrow compared to the bulk off the landmasses they unite north america and south america are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent  model  however  they may also be viewed as a single continent known as america or the americas  this viewpoint was common in the united states until world war ii  and remains prevalent in some asian six-continent  this remains the more common vision in latin american countries  spain  portugal  france  italy and greece  where they are taught as a single continent the criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of eurasia is classified as two separate continents  europe and asia  physiographically  europe and south asia are peninsulas of the eurasian landmass  however  europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of 10,180,000  square kilometres (3,930,000  sq mi   while south asia  with less than half that area  is considered a subcontinent  the alternative view—in geology and geography—that eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent  view of the world  some view separation of eurasia into asia and europe as a residue of eurocentrism   in physical  cultural and historical diversity  china and india are comparable to the entire european landmass  not to a single european country  however  for historical and cultural the view of europe as a separate continent continues in several needed if continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses  embracing all the contiguous land of a body  then africa  asia  and europe form a single continent which may be referred to as afro-eurasia.  this produces a four-continent  model consisting of afro-eurasia,  america  antarctica and australia when sea levels were lower during the pleistocene ice ages  greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land  forming land bridges  at those times australia–new guinea was a single  continuous continent  likewise the americas and afro-eurasia  were joined by the bering land bridge  other islands such as great britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents  at that time there were just three discrete continents  afro-eurasia-america,  antarctica  and australia-new  guinea  there are several ways of distinguishing the continents the term oceania refers to a group of island countries and territories in the pacific ocean  together with the continent of pacific islands with ties to other continents  such as japan  hawaii or easter island  are usually grouped with those continents rather than oceania  this term is used in several different continental models instead of australia aside from the conventionally known continents  the scope and meaning of the term continent varies  supercontinents  largely in evidence earlier in the geological record  are landmasses that comprise more than one craton or continental core  these have included laurasia  gondwana  vaalbara  kenorland  columbia  rodinia  and pangaea certain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents  especially the large peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features  the most notable examples are the indian subcontinent and the arabian the southern cone of south america and alaskan peninsula of north america are other many of these cases  the  subcontinents  concerned are on different tectonic plates from the rest of the continent  providing a geological justification for the greenland  generally reckoned as the world s largest island on the northeastern periphery of the north american plate  is sometimes referred to as a this is a significant departure from the more conventional view of a subcontinent as comprising a very large peninsula on the fringe of a continent where the americas are viewed as a single continent  america   it is divided into two subcontinents  north america and south or three  with central america being the when eurasia is regarded as a single continent  europe is treated as a areas of continental crust are largely covered by the sea and may be considered submerged continents  notable examples are zealandia  emerging from the sea primarily in new zealand and new caledonia  and the almost completely submerged kerguelen plateau in the southern indian ocean some islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass  while not considered continents because of their relatively small size  they may be considered microcontinents  madagascar  the largest example  is usually considered an island of africa but has been referred to as  the eighth continent  from a biological may be defined differently for specific purposes  the biodiversity information standards organization has developed the world geographical scheme for recording plant distributions  used in many international plant databases  this scheme divides the world into nine  botanical continents   some match the traditional geographical continents  but some differ significantly  thus the americas are divided between northern america  mexico northwards  and southern america  central america and the caribbean southwards  rather than between north america and south term  continent  translates greek ἤπειρος  properly  landmass  terra firma   the proper name of epirus and later especially used of asia  i e  asia the first distinction between continents was made by ancient greek mariners who gave the names europe and asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the aegean sea  the dardanelles strait  the sea of marmara  the bosporus strait and the black the names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the but the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and      beyond that point the hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible eurasia greek thinkers subsequently debated whether africa  then called libya  should be considered part of asia or a third part of the world  division into three parts eventually came to from the greek viewpoint  the aegean sea was the center of the world  asia lay to the east  europe to the north and west  and africa to the the boundaries between the continents were not fixed  early on  the europe–asia boundary was taken to run from the black sea along the rioni river  known then as the phasis  in georgia  later it was viewed as running from the black sea through kerch strait  the sea of azov and along the don river  known then as the tanais  in the boundary between asia and africa was generally taken to be the nile river  in the 5th  century bc  however  objected to the unity of egypt being split into asia and africa   libya   and took the boundary to lie along the western border of egypt  regarding egypt as part of asia  he also questioned the division into three of what is really a single a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later eratosthenes  in the 3rd  century bc  noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers  the nile and the don   thus considering them  islands   others divided the continents by isthmuses  calling the continents  peninsulas   these latter geographers set the border between europe and asia at the isthmus between the black sea and the caspian sea  and the border between asia and africa at the isthmus between the red sea and the mouth of lake bardawil on the mediterranean the roman period and the middle ages  a few writers took the isthmus of suez as the boundary between asia and africa  but most writers continued to consider it the nile or the western border of egypt needed   in the middle ages  the world was usually portrayed on t and o maps  with the t representing the waters dividing the three continents  by the middle of the 18th  century   the fashion of dividing asia and africa at the nile  or at the great catabathmus boundary between egypt and libya  farther west  had even then scarcely passed columbus sailed across the atlantic ocean to the west indies in 1492,  sparking a period of european exploration of the americas  but despite four voyages to the americas  columbus never believed he had reached a new continent—he always thought it was part of asia in 1501,  amerigo vespucci and gonçalo coelho attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the asian mainland into the indian ocean  passing through fernando de noronha  after reaching the coast of brazil  they sailed a long way further south along the coast of south america  confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than asia was known on return to europe  an account of the voyage  called mundus novus   new world    was published under vespucci s name in 1502  or although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another regardless of who penned the words  mundus novus credited vespucci with saying   i have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our europe  or asia or the first known explicit identification of part of the americas as a continent like the other three within a few years the name  new world  began appearing as a name for south america on world maps  such as the oliveriana  pesaro  map of around 1504–1505.  maps of this time though  still showed north america connected to asia and showed south america as a separate 1507  martin waldseemüller published a world map  universalis cosmographia  which was the first to show north and south america as separate from asia and surrounded by water  a small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the americas being east of asia and separated from asia by an ocean  as opposed to just placing the americas on the left end of the map and asia on the right end  in the accompanying book cosmographiae introductio  waldseemüller noted that the earth is divided into four parts  europe  asia  africa and the fourth part  which he named  america  after amerigo vespucci s first on the map  the word  america  was placed on part of south america from the 16th  century the english noun continent was derived from the term continent land  meaning continuous or connected and translated from the latin terra the noun was used to mean  a connected or continuous tract of land  or it was not applied only to very large areas of land—in the 17th  century  references were made to the continents  or mainlands  of isle of man  ireland and wales and in 1745  to the word continent was used in translating greek and latin writings about the three  parts  of the world  although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as continent was continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land  on the other hand geographers again raised herodotus s query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents  in the mid-17th  century  peter heylin wrote in his cosmographie that  a continent is a great quantity of land  not separated by any sea from the rest of the world  as the whole continent of europe  asia  africa   in 1727,  ephraim chambers wrote in his cyclopædia   the world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents  the old and the new   and in his 1752  atlas  emanuel bowen defined a continent as  a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together  without any separation by water  thus europe  asia  and africa is one great continent  as america is however  the old idea of europe  asia and africa as  parts  of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents from the late 18th  century  some geographers started to regard north america and south america as two parts of the world  making five parts in total  overall though  the fourfold division prevailed well into the 19th  discovered australia in 1606,  but for some time it was taken as part of asia  by the late 18th  century  some geographers considered it a continent in its own right  making it the sixth  or fifth for those still taking america as a single in 1813,  samuel butler wrote of australia as  new holland  an immense island  which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent  and the oxford english dictionary was just as equivocal some decades was sighted in 1820  during the first russian antarctic expedition and described as a continent by charles wilkes on the united states exploring expedition in 1838,  the last continent identified  although a great  antarctic   antipodean  landmass had been anticipated for millennia  an 1849  atlas labelled antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after world war the mid-19th  century  atlases published in the united states more commonly treated north and south america as separate continents  while atlases published in europe usually considered them one continent  however  it was still not uncommon for american atlases to treat them as one continent up until world war the 1950s,  most u s  geographers divided the americas into two with the addition of antarctica  this made the seven-continent  model  however  this division of the americas never appealed to latin americans  who saw their region spanning an américa as a single landmass  and there the conception of six continents remains dominant  as it does in scattered other needed some geographers regard europe and asia together as a single continent  dubbed in this model  the world is divided into six continents  with north america and south america considered separate continents geologists use the term continent in a different manner from geographers  where a continent is defined by continental crust  a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock  largely of granitic composition  some geologists restrict the term  continent  to portions of the crust built around stable precambrian  shield   typically 1.5  to 3.8  billion years old  called a craton  the craton itself is an accretionary complex of ancient mobile belts  mountain belts  from earlier cycles of subduction  continental collision and break-up  from plate tectonic activity  an outward-thickening  veneer of younger  minimally deformed sedimentary rock covers much of the craton  the margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or deltaic sediments  beyond the margin  there is either a continental shelf and drop off to the basaltic ocean basin or the margin of another continent  depending on the current plate-tectonic  setting of the continent  a continental boundary does not have to be a body of water  over geologic time  continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas  and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent  the current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are  high and dry   that is  many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic argue that continents are accretionary crustal  rafts  that  unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins  are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction  this accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons  by this definition  eastern europe  india and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas  i e  east european craton and indian craton   younger mobile belts  such as the ural mountains and himalayas  mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of eurasia there are many microcontinents  or continental fragments  that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton  some of these are fragments of gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents  zealandia  which includes new zealand and new caledonia  madagascar  the northern mascarene plateau  which includes the seychelles  other islands  such as several in the caribbean sea  are composed largely of granitic rock as well  but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust  and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition  the kerguelen plateau  for example  is largely volcanic  but is associated with the breakup of gondwanaland and is considered a whereas volcanic iceland and hawaii are not  the british isles  sri lanka  borneo  and newfoundland are margins of the laurasian continent—only separated by inland seas flooding its margins plate tectonics offers yet another way of defining continents  today  europe and most of asia constitute the unified eurasian plate  which is approximately coincident with the geographic eurasian continent excluding india  arabia  and far eastern russia  india contains a central shield  and the geologically recent himalaya mobile belt forms its northern margin  north america and south america are separate continents  the connecting isthmus being largely the result of volcanism from relatively recent subduction tectonics  north american continental rocks extend to greenland  a portion of the canadian shield   and in terms of plate boundaries  the north american plate includes the easternmost portion of the asian land mass  geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern asia is part of the north american continent  even though the plate boundary extends there  the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions   continental rocks    plate boundaries   are used as appropriate the movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up  of continents over time  including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents  the supercontinent columbia or nuna formed during a period of 2.0–1.8  billion years and broke up about 1.5–1.3  billion years the supercontinent rodinia is thought to have formed about 1  billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of earth s continents  and broken up into eight continents around 600  million years ago  the eight continents later re-assembled  into another supercontinent called pangaea  pangaea broke up into laurasia  which became north america and eurasia  and gondwana  which became the remaining continents  the following table lists the seven
