 photogrammetry -  wikipediaphotogrammetry is the science of making measurements from photographs  especially for recovering the exact positions of surface points  photogrammetry is as old as modern photography  dating to the mid-19th  century and in the simplest example  the distance between two points that lie on a plane parallel to the photographic image plane  can be determined by measuring their distance on the image  if the scale  s  of the image is known photogrammetric analysis may be applied to one photograph  or may use high-speed  photography and remote sensing to detect  measure and record complex 2-d  and 3-d  motion fields by feeding measurements and imagery analysis into computational models in an attempt to successively estimate  with increasing accuracy  the actual  3-d  relative motions from its beginning with the stereoplotters used to plot contour lines on topographic maps  it now has a very wide range of uses  see also sonar  radar  lidar  etc   photogrammetry has been defined by the american society for photogrammetry and remote sensing  asprs  as the art  science  and technology of obtaining reliable information about physical objects and the environment through processes of recording  measuring and interpreting photographic images and patterns of recorded radiant electromagnetic energy and other uses methods from many disciplines  including optics and projective geometry  digital image capturing and photogrammetric processing includes several well defined stages  which allow to generate 2d  or 3d  digital models of the object as an end the data model on the right shows what type of information can go into and come out of photogrammetric methods the 3-d  co-ordinates  define the locations of object points in the 3-d  space  the image co-ordinates  define the locations of the object points  images on the film or an electronic imaging device  the exterior of a camera defines its location in space and its view direction  the inner orientation defines the geometric parameters of the imaging process  this is primarily the focal length of the lens  but can also include the description of lens distortions  further additional observations play an important role  with scale bars  basically a known distance of two points in space  or known fix points  the connection to the basic measuring units is created each of the four main variables can be an input or an output of a photogrammetric method algorithms for photogrammetry typically attempt to minimize the sum of the squares of errors over the coordinates and relative displacements of the reference points  this minimization is known as bundle adjustment and is often performed using the levenbergâ€“marquardt algorithm a special case  called stereophotogrammetry  involves estimating the three-dimensional  coordinates of points on an object employing measurements made in two or more photographic images taken from different positions  see stereoscopy   common points are identified on each image  a line of sight  or ray  can be constructed from the camera location to the point on the object  it is the intersection of these rays  triangulation  that determines the three-dimensional  location of the point  more sophisticated algorithms can exploit other information about the scene that is known a priori  for example symmetries  in some cases allowing reconstructions of 3-d  coordinates from only one camera position  stereophotogrammetry is emerging as a robust non-contacting  measurement technique to determine dynamic characteristics and mode shapes of and rotating data with a dense range data in which scanners complement each other  photogrammetry is more accurate in the x and y direction while range data are generally more accurate in the z direction  this range data can be supplied by techniques like lidar  laser scanners  using time of flight  triangulation or interferometry   white-light  digitizers and any other technique that scans an area and returns x  y  z coordinates for multiple discrete points  commonly called  point clouds    photos can clearly define the edges of buildings when the point cloud footprint can not  it is beneficial to incorporate the advantages of both systems and integrate them to create a better product a 3-d  visualization can be created by georeferencing the aerial and lidar data in the same reference frame  orthorectifying the aerial photos  and then draping the orthorectified images on top of the lidar grid  it is also possible to create digital terrain models and thus 3-d  visualisations using pairs  or multiples  of aerial photographs or satellite  e g  spot satellite imagery   techniques such as adaptive least squares stereo matching are then used to produce a dense array of correspondences which are transformed through a camera model to produce a dense array of x  y  z data which can be used to produce digital terrain model and orthoimage products  systems which use these techniques  e g  the itg system  were developed in the 1980s  and 1990s  but have since been supplanted by lidar and radar-based  approaches  although these techniques may still be useful in deriving elevation models from old aerial photographs or satellite images photogrammetry is used in fields such as topographic mapping  architecture  engineering  manufacturing  quality control  police investigation  and geology  archaeologists use it to quickly produce plans of large or complex sites  and meteorologists use it to determine the wind speed of tornados when objective weather data cannot be obtained it is also used to combine live action with computer-generated  imagery in movies post-production;  the matrix is a good example of the use of photogrammetry in film  details are given in the dvd extras   photogrammetry was used extensively to create photorealistic environmental assets for video games including the vanishing of ethan carter as well as ea dice s star wars somewhat similar application is the scanning of objects to automatically make 3d  models of them  some programs like 3df  zephyr  realitycapture  acute3d's  smart3dcapture,  now part of bentley systems and renamed contextcapture  pix4dmapper,  photoscan  123d  catch  bundler pixdim  and have been made to allow people to quickly make 3d  models using this photogrammetry method  it should be noted though that the produced model often still contains gaps  so additional cleanup with software like meshlab  netfabb or meshmixer is often still is also commonly employed in collision engineering  especially with automobiles  when litigation for accidents occurs and engineers need to determine the exact deformation present in the vehicle  it is common for several years to have passed and the only evidence that remains is accident scene photographs taken by the police  photogrammetry is used to determine how much the car in question was deformed  which relates to the amount of energy required to produce that deformation  the energy can then be used to determine important information about the crash  such as the velocity at time of impact  there exist many software packages for photogrammetry  see comparison of photogrammetry software
