 tropical storm vamei -  wikipediatropical storm vamei was a pacific tropical cyclone that formed closer to the equator than any other tropical cyclone in the pacific ocean  the last storm of the 2001  pacific typhoon season  vamei developed on december 26  at 1.4°  n in the south china sea  it strengthened quickly and made landfall along extreme southeastern peninsular malaysia  vamei rapidly dissipated over sumatra on december 28,  and the remnants eventually re-organized  in the north indian ocean though vamei was officially designated as a tropical storm  its intensity is disputed  some agencies classify it as a typhoon  based on sustained winds of 140  km h (85  mph  and the appearance of an eye  the storm brought flooding and landslides to eastern peninsular malaysia  causing $3.6  million in damage (2001  usd  $4.87  million 2017  usd  and five deaths on december 19,  a small low-level  circulation was located along the northwest coastline of borneo  at the same time a plume of cold air progressed southward through the south china sea on the southeastern periphery of a ridge over the far east  the vortex drifted southwestward  reaching open water by december 21.  the northerly air surge was deflected after interacting with the circulation  and at the same time a portion of the air surge crossed the equator  the southerly flow turned eastward  then northward  and in combination with the northerly flow it wrapped into the vortex  resulting in rapid development of the low-level  circulation  just a short distance north of the by december 25,  an area of scattered convection persisted about 370  km (230  mi  east of singapore within an area of low wind shear  in association with the low-level  circulation  continuing slowly westward  the convection deepened and organized and at 1200  utc on december 26  the disturbance developed into a tropical depression about 230  km (145  mi  east of singapore  or 156  km (97  mi  north of the this was the first recorded occurrence of a tropical cyclone near the depression strengthened further and officially attained tropical storm status at 0000  utc on december 27,  based on the analysis by the japan meteorological agency though the joint typhoon warning center  jtwc  unofficially classified it as a tropical storm six hours prior  shortly thereafter  an eye with a 39  km (24  mi  diameter became apparent on satellite imagery  along with rainbands extending southward to the opposite side of the equator  at 0600  utc  the jma first classified the system as tropical storm vamei  about 65  km (40  mi  northeast of and the agency estimated the storm attained peak winds of 85  km h (50  mph  at the same however  the jtwc upgraded vamei to typhoon status with peak winds of 140  km h (85  mph   based on a united states navy ship report from within the eye  a second ship reported wind gusts of 195  km h (120  mph  in the southern portion of the eyewall  the storm was small and compact  with gales extending about 45  km (30  mi  from its center  at about 0830  utc on december 27,  vamei made landfall approximately 60  km (35  mi  northeast of in the southeastern portion of the malaysian state of initially  the malaysian meteorological department  metmalaysia  classified the cyclone as a tropical though it was later re-assessed  as a typhoon at storm vamei weakened quickly as it crossed the extreme southern portion of the malay peninsula  and late on december 27  the jma downgraded it to tropical depression status before the cyclone emerged into the straits of the jtwc initially maintained it as a minimal tropical storm  though the agency downgraded the storm to depression status as the center again approached early on december 28,  vamei moved ashore along northeastern sumatra  and at 0600  utc the jma classified the storm as however  convection persisted near the circulation over land  believed to have been caused by the process known as upper-level  diffluence  on december 29,  what was originally believed to be a separate system reached the southeastern bay of bengal  in a post-season  re-evaluation,  the jtwc classified the system as a continuation of vamei  based on analysis of satellite imagery that indicated the circulation of vamei crossed sumatra without dissipating  convection re-developed,  and late on december 30  the jtwc classified the cyclone as a tropical storm about 390  km (245  mi  west-southwest  of the northwestern tip of sumatra  initially  due to being treated as a separate system  it was classified as tropical cyclone 05b.  vamei quickly developed good outflow and organization  though increased wind shear on december 31  rapidly weakened the storm  by late that day  the center was exposed from the deep convection  and vamei quickly formed and reached tropical storm strength at 1.5º  n  only 156  km (97  mi  from the this broke the previous record of typhoon sarah in the 1956  pacific typhoon season  which reached tropical storm strength at 2.2º  due to a lack of coriolis effect near the equator  the formation of vamei was previously considered however  a study by the naval postgraduate school indicated that the probability for a similar equatorial development was at least once every four developed in a vortex that appears every winter along the northwest coast of borneo and is maintained by the interaction between monsoonal winds and the local topography  often  the vortex remains near the coastline  and in an analysis of 51  winters  only six reported the vortex as being over the equatorial waters for four days or more  as the area in the south china sea between borneo and singapore is only 665  km (415  mi  wide  a vortex needs to move slowly to develop  a persistent northerly wind surge for more than five days  which is needed to enhance the vortex  is present  on average  nine days each winter  the probability for a pre-existing  tropical disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone is between 10–30  percent  thus  the conditions which resulted in the formation of vamei are believed to occur once every 100–400  days prior to vamei moving ashore  the malaysian meteorological department  metmalaysia  issued storm advisories for potentially affected areas  subsequently  the agency issued warnings for heavy rainfall  high winds  and rough however  few citizens knew of the passage of the rare of malaysia  two u s  navy ships in vamei s eyewall were damaged by strong upon moving ashore  the storm brought storm surge damage to portions of southeastern peninsular vamei brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to portions of melaka  negeri sembilan  and selangor as well as to johor  where rainfall reached over 200  mm (8  in  in senai  additionally  monsoonal moisture  influenced by the storm  produced moderate to heavy precipitation across various regions of peninsular the passage of the cyclone resulted in flooding and mudslides  which forced the evacuation of more than 13,195  people in johor and pahang states into 69  along gunung pulai  the rainfall caused a landslide which destroyed four houses and killed five people  river flooding was also reported  as a result of the precipitation from vamei as well as previous rainfall  damage from the flooding was estimated at rm13.7  million (2001  myr  $3.6  million 2001  usd   about 40  percent of the damage occurred to crops at a farm in kota tinggi  moderate damage to transportation  education  and health-care  facilities was also reported  the malaysian government provided affected families up to rm5,000  (2001  myr  $1,300  2001  usd  in assistance for food  clothing  and vamei also brought heavy rainfall to which caused air traffic disruptions at the singapore changi the passage of the cyclone resulted in many downed 2004,  the name  vamei  was retired and replaced with  peipah   becoming the first retired name since the japan meteorological agency began naming pacific typhoons in 2000.  vamei was one of four tropical cyclones in the current naming list that was retired without attaining typhoon status  the others were tropical storm bilis in 2006,  tropical storm washi in 2011  and sonamu in
