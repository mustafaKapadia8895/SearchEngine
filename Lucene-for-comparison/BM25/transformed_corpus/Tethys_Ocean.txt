 tethys ocean -  wikipediathe tethys ocean  ancient greek  τηθύς   tethys sea or neotethys was an ocean during much of the mesozoic era located between the ancient continents of gondwana and laurasia  before the opening of the indian and atlantic oceans during the cretaceous period the name stems from the mythological greek sea goddess tethys  sister and consort of oceanus  mother of the great rivers  lakes and fountains of the world and of the oceanid sea needed the eastern part of the tethys ocean is sometimes referred to as eastern tethys  the western part of the tethys ocean is called tethys sea  western tethys ocean or paratethys or alpine tethys ocean  the black  caspian and aral seas are thought to be its crustal remains  though the black sea may in fact be a remnant of the older paleo-tethys  the western tethys was not simply a single open ocean  it covered many small plates  cretaceous island arcs and microcontinents  many small oceanic basins  valais ocean  piemont-liguria  ocean  meliata ocean  were separated from each other by continental terranes on the alboran  iberian  and apulian plates  the high sea level in the mesozoic era flooded most of these continental domains  forming shallow needed  as theories have improved  scientists have extended the  tethys  name to refer to 3  similar oceans that preceded it  separating the continental terranes  in asia  the paleo-tethys   devonian–triassic   meso-tethys   late early permian–late cretaceous  and ceno-tethy  (late-triassic–cenozoic)  are neither tethys oceans should be confused with the rheic ocean  which existed to the west of them in the silurian to the north of the tethys  the then land mass was called angaraland and to the south of it  it was called needed from the ediacaran (600  ma  into the devonian (360  ma   the proto-tethys  ocean existed and was situated between baltica and laurentia to the north and gondwana to the south from the silurian (440  ma  through the jurassic periods  the paleo-tethys  ocean existed between the hunic terranes and gondwana  over a period of 400  million years  continental terranes intermittently separated from gondwana in the southern hemisphere to migrate northward to form asia in the northern 250  million years during the triassic  a new ocean began forming in the southern end of the paleo-tethys  ocean  a rift formed along the northern continental shelf of southern pangaea  gondwana   over the next 60  million years  that piece of shelf  known as cimmeria  traveled north  pushing the floor of the paleo-tethys  ocean under the eastern end of northern pangaea  i e laurasia   the tethys ocean formed between cimmeria and gondwana  directly over where the paleo-tethys  used to needed during the jurassic period about 150ma,  cimmeria finally collided with laurasia and stalled  so the ocean floor behind it buckled under  forming the tethyan trench  water levels rose  and the western tethys shallowly covered significant portions of europe  forming the first tethys sea  around the same time  laurasia and gondwana began drifting apart  opening an extension of the tethys sea between them which today is the part of the atlantic ocean between the mediterranean and the caribbean  as north and south america were still attached to the rest of laurasia and gondwana  respectively  the tethys ocean in its widest extension was part of a continuous oceanic belt running around the earth between about latitude 30°  n and the equator  thus  ocean currents at the time around the early cretaceous ran very differently from the way they do needed between the jurassic and the late cretaceous  which started about 100  ma  gondwana began breaking up  pushing africa and india north across the tethys and opening up the indian ocean  as these land masses crowded in on the tethys ocean from all sides  to as recently as the late miocene 15  ma  the ocean continued to shrink  becoming the tethys seaway or second tethys sea  throughout the cenozoic (66  million to the dawn of the neogene  23  million years   global sea levels fell hundreds of meters  and eventually the connections between the atlantic and the tethys closed off in what is now the middle needed during the oligocene (33.9  million to 23  million before annum   large parts of central and eastern europe were covered by a northern branch of the tethys ocean  called the paratethys  the paratethys was separated from the tethys with the formation of the alps  carpathians  dinarides  taurus and elburz mountains during the alpine orogeny  during the late miocene the paratethys gradually disappeared  and became an isolated inland needed today  india  pakistan  indonesia  and the indian ocean cover the area once occupied by the tethys ocean  and turkey  iraq  and tibet sit on cimmeria  what was once the western arm of the tethys sea was the ancestor of the present-day  mediterranean sea  other remnants are the black  caspian  and aral seas via a former inland branch known as the paratethys  most of the floor of the tethys ocean disappeared under cimmeria and needed geologists including eduard suess have found fossils of ocean creatures in rocks in the himalayas  indicating that those rocks were once underwater  before the indian continental shelf began pushing upward as it collided with needed similar geologic evidence can be seen in the alpine orogeny of europe  where the movement of the african plate raised the alps  greece and the levant also retain many units of limestone and other sedimentary rocks deposited by various stands of the tethys needed paleontologists find the tethys ocean particularly important  because much of the world s sea shelves were found around its margins for such an extensive length of time with marine  marsh-dwelling,  and estuarian fossils from these needed  the solnhofen limestone in bavaria  originally a coastal lagoon mud of the tethys ocean  yielded the famous archaeopteryx fossil in 1885,  the austrian palaeontologist melchior neumayr deduced the existence of the tethys ocean from mesozoic marine sediments and their distribution  calling his concept  zentrales mittelmeer  and described it as a jurassic seaway  which extended from the caribbean to the 1893,  the austrian geologist eduard suess proposed the theory that an ancient and extinct inland sea had once existed between laurasia and the continents which formed gondwana ii  he named it the  tethys sea  after the greek sea goddess tethys  he provided evidence for his theory using fossil records from the alps and he proposed the concept of tethys in his four-volume  work das antlitz der erde  the face of the the following decades during the 20th  century  mobilist  geologists like uhlig (1911),  diener(1925),  and daque (1926)  regarded tethys as a large trough between two supercontinents which lasted from the late palaeozoic until continental fragments derived from gondwana obliterated it  after ww2,  tethys was described as a triangular ocean with a wide eastern needed from 1920s  to the 1960s   fixist  geologists  however  regarded tethys as a composite trough which evolved through a series of orogenic cycles  they used the terms  paleotethys    mesotethys   and  neotethys  for the caledonian  variscan  and alpine orogenies respectively  in the 1970s  and 1980s  these terms and 'proto-tethys',  were used in different senses by various authors  but the concept of a single ocean wedging into pangea from the east  roughly where suess first proposed it  the 1960s,  the theory of plate tectonics became established  and it became clear suess s  sea  had in fact been an ocean  plate tectonics provided an explanation for the mechanism by which the former ocean disappeared  oceanic crust can subduct under continental needed  tethys was considered an oceanic plate by smith (1971),  dewey  pitman  ryan and bonnin (1973),  laubscher and bernoulli (1973),  bijou-duval,
