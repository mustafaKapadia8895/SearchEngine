called the faeroe islands  are an archipelago between the norwegian sea and the north atlantic  about halfway between norway and iceland  320  kilometres (200  miles  north-northwest  of scotland  the islands are an autonomous country within the kingdom of their area is about 1,400  square kilometres (541  square miles  with a population of 50,030  in april faroes  terrain is rugged  and the islands have a subpolar oceanic climate  cfc   windy  wet  cloudy and cool  despite this island group s northerly latitude  temperatures average above freezing throughout the year because of the gulf stream between 1035  and 1814,  the faroes were part of the hereditary kingdom of norway  in 1814,  the treaty of kiel granted denmark control over the islands  along with two other norwegian island possessions  greenland and iceland  the faroe islands have been a self-governing  country within the kingdom of denmark since the faroese have control of most domestic matters  areas that remain the responsibility of denmark include military defence  the police department  the justice department  currency and foreign however  as they are not part of the same customs area as denmark  the faroe islands have an independent trade policy and can establish trade agreements with other states  the islands also have representation in the nordic council as members of the danish delegation  the people of the faroe islands also compete as a national team in certain sports in danish  the name færøerne may reflect an old norse word fær  sheep   the morpheme øerne represents a plural  with definite article  of ø  island  in danish  the danish name thus translates as  the islands of sheep   in faroese  the name appears as føroyar  oyar represents the plural of oy  older faroese for  island   the modern faroese word for island is oyggj  in the english language  their name is sometimes spelled evidence shows settlers living on the faroe islands in two successive periods prior to the arrival of the norse  the first between 300  and 600  ce and the second between 600  and 800  scientists from the university of aberdeen have also found early cereal pollen from domesticated plants  which further suggests people may have lived on the islands before the vikings archaeologist mike church noted that dicuil  see below  mentioned what may have been the faroes  he also suggested that the people living there might have been from ireland  scotland or scandinavia  possibly with groups from all three areas settling latin account of a voyage made by brendan  an irish monastic saint who lived around 484–578,  includes a description of insulae  islands  resembling the faroe islands  this association  however  is far from conclusive in its an irish monk of the early 9th  century  wrote a more definite account  in his geographical work de mensura orbis terrae he claimed he had reliable information of heremitae ex nostra scotia   hermits from our land of ireland scotland   who had lived on the northerly islands of britain for almost a hundred years until the arrival of norse settled the islands c  800,  bringing old west norse  which evolved into the modern faroese language  according to icelandic sagas such as færeyjar saga  one of the best known men in the island was tróndur í gøtu  a descendant of scandinavian chiefs who had settled in dublin  ireland  tróndur led the battle against sigmund brestursson  the norwegian monarchy and the norwegian church the norse and norse–gael settlers probably did not come directly from scandinavia  but rather from norse communities surrounding the irish sea  northern isles and outer hebrides of scotland  including the shetland and orkney islands  a traditional name for the islands in irish  na scigirí  possibly refers to the (eyja-)skeggjar  "(island-)beards",  a nickname given to island dwellers according to the færeyinga saga  more emigrants left norway who did not approve of the monarchy of harald fairhair  ruled c  872  to 930).  these people settled the faroes around the end of the 9th  early in the 11th  century  sigmundur brestisson (961–1005)  – whose clan had flourished in the southern islands before invaders from the northern islands almost exterminated it – escaped to norway  he was sent back to take possession of the islands for olaf tryggvason  king of norway from 995  to 1000.  sigmundur introduced christianity  forcing tróndur í gøtu to convert or face beheading and  though sigmundur was subsequently murdered  norwegian taxation was upheld  norwegian control of the faroes continued until 1814,  although  when the kingdom of norway (872–1397)  entered the kalmar union with denmark  it gradually resulted in danish control of the islands  the reformation reached the faroes in 1538.  when the union between denmark and norway dissolved as a result of the treaty of kiel in 1814,  denmark retained possession of the faroe islands  norway itself was joined in a union with sweden the trade monopoly in the faroe islands was abolished in 1856,  after which the area developed as a modern fishing nation with its own fishing fleet  the national awakening from 1888  initially arose from a struggle to maintain the faroese language and was thus culturally oriented  but after 1906  it became more political with the foundation of political parties of the faroe islands on 12  april 1940  british troops occupied the faroe islands  shortly after the german invasion of denmark on 9  april 1940.  in 1942–1943  the british royal engineers  under the leadership of lt  col  william law mc  built the only airport in the faroe islands  vágar airport  control of the islands reverted to denmark following the war  but in 1948  home rule was introduced  with a high degree of local autonomy  in 1973  the faroe islands declined to join denmark in entering the european economic community  later absorbed into the european union   the islands experienced considerable economic difficulties following the collapse of the fishing industry in the early 1990s,  but have since made efforts to diversify the economy  support for independence has grown and is the objective

vegetation of the faroe islands is dominated by arctic-alpine  plants  wildflowers  grasses  moss and lichen  most of the lowland area is grassland and some is heath  dominated by shrubby heathers  mainly calluna vulgaris  among the herbaceous flora that occur in the faroe islands is the cosmopolitan marsh thistle  cirsium there are no trees native to the faroe islands  limited species were able to be successfully introduced to the region  including the black cottonwood  also known as the california poplar  populus trichocarpa a few small plantations consisting of plants collected from similar climates such as tierra del fuego in south america and alaska thrive on the islands the bird fauna of the faroe islands is dominated by seabirds and birds attracted to open land like heather  probably because of the lack of woodland and other suitable habitats  many species have developed special faroese sub-species:  common eider  common starling  eurasian wren  common murre  and black the pied raven was endemic to the faroe islands  but has now become extinct only a few species of wild land mammals are found in the faroe islands today  all introduced by humans  three species are

orcinus orca  are regular visitors around the islands the domestic animals of the faroe islands are a result of 1,200  years of isolated breeding  as a result  many of the islands  domestic animals are found nowhere else in the world  faroese domestic breed include faroe pony  faroe cow  faroe sheep  faroese goose and faroese duck the faroese government holds executive power in local government affairs  the head of the government is called the løgmaður   law person   and serves as a premier  any other member of the cabinet is called a landsstýrismaður   national committee man   or landsstýriskvinna   national committee woman    the faroese parliament – the løgting   law assembly   – dates back to viking times and is believed to be one of the oldest parliaments in the world  the parliament currently has 33  contemporary times  elections are held at municipal  national  løgting  and danish  folketing  levels  until 2007,  there were seven electoral districts  each comprising a sýsla  while streymoy was divided into a northern and southern part  tórshavn region   however  on 25  october 2007,  changes were made such that the entire country is one electoral district  giving each vote equal weight administratively  the islands are divided into 30  municipalities  kommunur  within which there are 120  or so settlements traditionally  there are also the six sýslur  similar to the british  shire   norðoyar  eysturoy  streymoy  vágar  sandoy and suðuroy   although today sýsla technically means  police district   the term is still commonly used to indicate a geographical region  in earlier times  each sýsla had its own assembly  the so-called  várting   spring assembly   the faroe islands have been under norwegian danish control since 1388.  the 1814  treaty of kiel terminated the danish-norwegian  union  and norway came under the rule of the king of sweden  while the faroe islands  iceland and greenland remained danish possessions  from ancient times the faroe islands had a parliament  løgting  which was abolished in 1816,  and the faroe islands were to be governed as an ordinary danish amt  county   with the amtmand as its head of government  in 1851,  the løgting was reinstated  but  until 1948,  served mainly as an advisory body the islands are home to a notable independence movement that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades  at the end of world war ii  some of the population favoured independence from denmark  and on 14  september 1946  an independence referendum was held on the question of secession  it was a consultative referendum  the parliament was not bound to follow the people s vote  this was the first time that the faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence or wanted to continue within the danish kingdom the result of the vote was a narrow majority in favour of secession  but the coalition in parliament could not reach agreement on how this outcome should be interpreted and implemented  and because of these irresoluble differences  the coalition fell apart  a parliamentary election was held a few months later  in which the political parties that favoured staying in the danish kingdom increased their share of the vote and formed a coalition  based on this  they chose to reject secession  instead  a compromise was made and the folketing passed a home-rule  law that went into effect in 1948.  the faroe islands  status as a danish amt was thereby brought to an end  the faroe islands were given a high degree of self-governance,  supported by a financial subsidy from denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on danish services at present  the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the kingdom of denmark  within both camps there is a wide range of opinions  of those who favour independence  some are in favour of an immediate unilateral declaration of independence  others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the danish government and the danish nation  in the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with denmark are maintained as of a new draft faroese constitution is being drawn up  however the draft has been declared by the danish prime minister  lars løkke rasmussen  as incompatible with denmark s constitution and if the faroese political parties wish to continue with it then they must declare explicitly asserted by both treaties of the european union  the faroe islands are not part of the european union  the faroes are not grouped with the eu when it comes to international trade  for instance  when the eu and russia imposed reciprocal trade sanctions on each other over the war in donbass in 2014,  the faroes began exporting significant amounts of fresh salmon to moreover  a protocol to the treaty of accession of denmark to the european communities stipulates that danish nationals residing in the faroe islands are not considered danish nationals within the meaning of the treaties  hence  danish people living in the faroes are not citizens of the european union  though other eu nationals living there remain eu citizens   the faroes are not covered by the schengen agreement  but there are no border checks when travelling between the faroes and any schengen country  the faroes have been part of the nordic passport union since 1966,  and since 2001  there have been no permanent border checks between the nordic countries and the rest of the schengen area as part of the schengen faroe islands are not a fully independent country  but they do have political relations directly with other countries through agreement with denmark  the faroe islands are a member of some international organisations as though they were an independent country the faroe islands are a member of several international sports federations like uefa  fifa in and fina in and ehf in and have their own national teams  the faroe islands have their own telephone country code  internet country code top-level  domain  banking code and postal country code the faroe islands make their own agreements with other countries regarding trade and commerce  when the eu embargo against russia started in 2014,  the faroe islands were not a part of the embargo because they are not a part of eu  and the islands had just themselves experienced a year of embargo from the eu including denmark against the islands  the faroese prime minister kaj leo johannesen went to moscow to negotiate the trade between the two the faroese minister of fisheries negotiates with the eu and other countries regarding the rights to vast majority of the population are ethnic faroese  of norse and celtic recent dna analyses have revealed that y chromosomes  tracing male descent  are 87%  the studies show that mitochondrial dna  tracing female descent  is 84%  is a gender deficit of about 2,000  women owing to three hundred women from the philippines and thailand  recruited as wives because of the faroes  gender imbalance  make up the largest ethnic minority in the total fertility rate of the faroe islands is currently one of the highest in the fertility rate is 2.409  children born per woman (2015  2011  census shows that of the approximately 48,600  inhabitants of the faroe islands (17,441  private households in 2011),  43,135  were born in the faroe islands  3,597  were born in the other two countries of the kingdom of denmark  denmark or greenland   and 1,614  were born outside the kingdom of denmark  people were also asked about their nationality  including faroese  children under 15  were not asked about their nationality  97%  said that they were ethnic faroese  which means that many of those who were born in either denmark or greenland consider themselves as ethnic faroese  the other 3%  of those older than 15  said they were not faroese  515  were danish  433  were from other european countries  147  came from asia  65  from africa  55  from the americas  23  from the faroe islands have people from 77  different nationalities if the first inhabitants of the faroe islands were irish monks  then they must have lived as a very small group of settlers  later  when the vikings colonised the islands  there was a considerable increase in the population  however  it never exceeded 5,000  until the 19th  century  around 1349,  about half the population perished in the black death plague only with the rise of the deep-sea  fishery  and thus independence from agriculture in the islands  harsh terrain  and with general progress in the health service was rapid population growth possible in the faroes  beginning in the 19th  century  the population increased tenfold in 200  years at the beginning of the 1990s,  the faroe islands entered a deep economic crisis leading to heavy emigration  however  this trend reversed in subsequent years to a net immigration  this has been in the form of a population replacement as young faroese women leave and are replaced with asian pacific in 2011  there were 2,155  more men than women between the age of 0  to 59  in the faroe faroese population is spread across most of the area  it was not until recent decades that significant urbanisation occurred  industrialisation has been remarkably decentralised  and the area has therefore maintained quite a viable rural culture  nevertheless  villages with poor harbour facilities have been the losers in the development from agriculture to fishing  and in the most peripheral agricultural areas  also known as útoyggjar  outer islands   there are few young people  in recent decades  the village-based  social structure has nevertheless been placed under pressure  giving way to a rise in interconnected  centres  that are better able to provide goods and services than the badly connected periphery  this means that shops and services are now relocating en masse from the villages into the centres  and slowly but steadily the faroese population is concentrating in and around the centres in the 1990s,  the government abandoned the old national policy of developing the villages  bygdamenning   and instead began a process of regional development  økismenning   the term  region  referred to the large islands of the faroes  nevertheless  the government was unable to press through the structural reform of merging small rural municipalities to create sustainable  decentralised entities that could drive forward regional development  as regional development has been difficult on the administrative level  the government has instead invested heavily in infrastructure  interconnecting the regions in general  it is becoming less valid to regard the faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions  the huge investments in roads  bridges and sub-sea  tunnels  see also transport in the faroe islands  have bound the islands together  creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90%  of the population  from this perspective it is reasonable to regard the faroes as a dispersed city or even to refer to it as the faroese network needed faroese is spoken in the entire area as a first language  it is difficult to say exactly how many people worldwide speak the faroese language  because many ethnic faroese live in denmark  and few who are born there return to the faroes with their parents or as adults the faroese language is one of the smallest of the germanic languages  written faroese  grammar and vocabulary  is most similar to icelandic and to their ancestor old norse  though the spoken language is closer to norwegian dialects of western norway  although faroese is the official language on the islands  danish is taught in schools and can be used by the faroese government in public language policy provides for the active creation of new terms in faroese suitable for modern life according to the færeyinga saga  sigmundur brestisson brought christianity to the islands in 999.  however  archaeology at a site in toftanes  leirvík named bønhústoftin  english  prayer-house  ruin  and over a dozen slabs from ólansgarður in the small island of skúvoy which in the main display encircled linear and outline crosses  suggest that celtic christianity may have arrived at least 150  years the faroe islands  church reformation was completed on 1  january 1540.  according to official statistics from 2002,  84.1%  of the faroese population are members of the state church  the church of the faroe islands  fólkakirkjan   a form of lutheranism  the fólkakirkjan became an independent church in 2007;  previously it had been a diocese within the church of denmark  faroese members of the clergy who have had historical importance include venceslaus ulricus hammershaimb (1819–1909),  fríðrikur petersen (1853–1917)  and  perhaps most significantly  jákup dahl (1878–1944),  who had a great influence in ensuring that the faroese language was spoken in the church instead of danish  participation in churches is more prevalent among the faroese population than among most other scandinavians in the late 1820s,  the christian evangelical religious movement  the plymouth brethren  was established in england  in 1865,  a member of this movement  william gibson sloan  travelled to the faroes from shetland  at the turn of the 20th  century  the faroese plymouth brethren numbered thirty  today  around 10%  of the faroese population are members of the open brethren community  brøðrasamkoman   about 3%  belong to the charismatic movement  there are several charismatic churches around the islands  the largest of which  called keldan  the spring   has about 200  to 300  members  about 2%  belong to other christian groups  the adventists operate a private school in tórshavn  jehovah s witnesses also have four congregations with a total of 121  members  the roman catholic congregation has about 170  members and falls under the jurisdiction of denmark s roman catholic diocese of copenhagen  the municipality of tórshavn has an old franciscan school there are also around fifteen bahá ís who meet at four different places  the ahmadiyyas established a community in the faroe islands in 2010.  unlike denmark  sweden and iceland with forn siðr  the faroes have no organised heathen community the best-known  church buildings in the faroe islands include tórshavn cathedral  olaf ii of norway s church and the magnus cathedral in kirkjubøur  the vesturkirkjan and the maria church  both of which are situated in tórshavn  the church of fámjin  the octagonal church in haldórsvík  christianskirkjan in klaksvík  and also the two pictured here in 1948,  victor danielsen  plymouth brethren  completed the first bible translation into faroese from different modern languages  jacob dahl and kristian osvald viderø  fólkakirkjan  completed the second translation in 1961.  the latter was translated from the original biblical languages  hebrew and greek  into faroese according to the 2011  census  there were 33,018  christians (95.44%),  23  muslims (0.07%),  7  hindus (0.02%),  66  buddhists (0.19%),  12  jews (0.03%),  13  baha i (0.04%),  3  sikhs (0.01%),  149  others (0.43%),  85  with more than one belief (0.25%)  and 1397  with no religion levels of education in the faroe islands are primary  secondary and higher education  most institutions are funded by the state  there are few private schools in the country  education is compulsory for 9  years between the ages of 7  and education consists of seven years of primary education and two years of lower secondary education  it is public  free of charge  provided by the respective municipalities  and is called the fólkaskúli in faroese  the fólkaskúli also provides optional preschool education as well as the tenth year of education that is a prerequisite to get admitted to upper secondary education  students that complete compulsory education are allowed to continue education in a vocational school  where they can have job-specific  training and education  since the fishing industry is an important part of country s economy  maritime schools are an important part of faroese education  upon completion of the tenth year of fólkaskúli  students can continue to upper secondary education which consists of several different types of schools  higher education is offered at the university of the faroe islands  a part of faroese youth moves abroad to pursue higher education  mainly in denmark  other forms of education comprise adult education and music schools  the structure of the faroese educational system bears resemblances with its danish the 12th  century  education was provided by the catholic church in the faroe the church of denmark took over education after the protestant modern educational institutions started operating in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and developed throughout the twentieth century  the status of the faroese language in education was a significant issue for decades  until it was accepted as a language of instruction in initially education was administered and regulated by in 1979  responsibilities on educational issues started transferring to the faroese authorities  a procedure which was completed in ministry of education  research and culture has the jurisdiction of educational responsibility in the faroe since the faroe islands is a constituent country of the danish realm  education in the faroe islands is influenced and has similarities with the danish educational system  there is an agreement on educational cooperation between the faroe islands and in 2012  the public spending on education was 8.1%  of the municipalities are responsible for the school buildings for children s education in fólkaskúlin from age 1st  grade to 9th  or 10th  grade  age 7  to in november 2013  1,615  people  or 6.8%  of the total number of employees  were employed in the education of the 31,270  people aged 25  and above 1,717  (5.5%)  have gained at least a master s degrees or a ph d   8,428  (27%)  have gained a b sc  or a diploma  11,706  (37.4%)  have finished upper secondary education while 9,419  (30.1%)  has only finished primary school and have no other there is no data on literacy in the faroe islands  but the cia factbook states that it is probably as high as in denmark proper  i e  majority of students in upper secondary schools are women  although men represent the majority in higher education institutions  in addition  most young faroese people who relocate to other countries to study are out of 8,535  holders of bachelor degrees  4,796  (56.2%)  have had their education in the faroe islands  2,724  (31.9%)  in denmark  543  in both the faroe islands and denmark  94  (1.1%)  in norway  80  in the united kingdom and the rest in other out of 1,719  holders of master s degrees or phds  1,249  (72.7%  have had their education in denmark  87  (5.1%)  in the united kingdom  86  (5%)  in both the faroe islands and denmark  64  (3.7%)  in the faroe islands  60  (3.5%)  in norway and the rest in other countries  mostly eu and since there is no medical school in the faroe islands  all medical students have to study abroad  as of out of a total of 96  medical students  76  studied in denmark  19  in poland and 1  in troubles caused by a collapse of the faroese fishing industry in the early 1990s  brought high unemployment rates of 10  to 15%  by the unemployment decreased in the later 1990s,  down to about 6%  at the end of by june 2008  unemployment had declined to 1.1%,  before rising to 3.4%  in early in december the unemployment was 3.2%.  nevertheless  the almost total dependence on fishing and fish farming means that the economy remains vulnerable  one of the biggest private companies of the faroe islands is the salmon farming company bakkafrost  which is the largest of the four salmon farming companies in the faroe and the eighth biggest in the found close to the faroese area gives hope for deposits in the immediate area  which may provide a basis for sustained economic of the faroe islands  national income comes as economic aid from this corresponds to roughly 5%  of 2000,  the government has fostered new information technology and business projects to attract new investment  the introduction of burger king in tórshavn was widely publicized as a sign of the globalization of faroese culture  it remains to be seen whether these projects will succeed in broadening the islands  economic base  the islands have one of the lowest unemployment rates in europe  but this should not necessarily be taken as a sign of a recovering economy  as many young students move to denmark and other countries after leaving high school  this leaves a largely middle-aged  and elderly population that may lack the skills and knowledge to fill newly developed positions on the faroes  nonetheless  in 2008  the faroes were able to make a $52  million loan to iceland to help with that country s banking 5  august 2009,  two opposition parties introduced a bill in the løgting to adopt the euro as the national currency  pending a road  the main islands are connected by bridges and tunnels  government owned strandfaraskip landsins provides public bus and ferry service to the main towns and villages  there are no railways by air  the government owned atlantic airways provides helicopter service to each of the islands  atlantic airways and other airlines have scheduled international flights to vágar airport  the islands  only airport  all civil aviation matters are controlled from the civil aviation administration denmark by sea  the smyril line operates a regular international passenger  car and freight service linking the faroe islands with seyðisfjörður  iceland and hirtshals  of the rocky terrain in the faroe islands  its road transport system was as extensive as in other places of the world  this situation has now changed  and the infrastructure has been developed extensively  some 80  percent of the population of the islands is connected by tunnels through the mountains and between the islands  bridges and causeways that link the three largest islands and three other larger and smaller islands to the northeast together  while the other two large islands to the south of the main area  sandoy and suðuroy  are connected to the main area with ferries  the small islands koltur and stóra dímun have no ferry connection  only helicopter service  other small islands—mykines in the west  kalsoy  svínoy and fugloy in the north  hestur west of streymoy  and nólsoy east of tórshavn—have

movements that swept across parts of europe  this means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture  the language spoken is faroese and it is one of three insular north germanic languages descended from the old norse language spoken in scandinavia in the viking age  the others being icelandic and the extinct norn  which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with faroese  until the 15th  century  faroese had a similar orthography to icelandic and norwegian  but after the reformation in 1538,  the ruling norwegians outlawed its use in schools  churches and official documents  although a rich spoken tradition survived  for 300  years the language was not written down  this means that all poems and stories were handed down orally  these works were split into the following divisions  sagnir  historical   ævintýr  stories  and kvæði  ballads   often set to music and the medieval chain dance  these were eventually written down in the 19th  century faroese written literature has only really developed in the past 100–200  years  this is mainly because of the islands  isolation  and also because the faroese language was not written down in a standardised format until 1890.  the danish language was also encouraged at the expense of faroese  nevertheless  the faroes have produced several authors and poets  a rich centuries-old  oral tradition of folk tales and faroese folk songs accompanied the faroese chain dance  the people learned these songs and stories by heart  and told or sung them to each other  teaching the younger generations too  this kind of literature was gathered in the 19th  century and early 20th  century  the faroese folk songs  in faroese called kvæði  are still in use although not so large-scale  as earlier  some of the faroese folk songs have been used by the faroese viking metal band týr  i e   ormurin first faroese novel  bábelstornið by regin í líð  was published in 1909;  the second novel

norðurlandahúsið  is the most important cultural institution in the faroes  its aim is to support and promote scandinavian and faroese culture  locally and in the nordic region  erlendur patursson (1913–86),  faroese member of the nordic council  raised the idea of a nordic cultural house in the faroe islands  a nordic competition for architects was held in 1977,  in which 158  architects participated  winners were ola steen from norway and kolbrún ragnarsdóttir from iceland  by staying true to folklore  the architects built the nordic house to resemble an enchanted hill of elves  the house opened in tórshavn in 1983.  the nordic house is a cultural organization under the nordic council  the nordic house is run by a steering committee of eight  of whom three are faroese and five from other nordic countries  there is also a local advisory body of fifteen members  representing faroese cultural organizations  the house is managed by a director appointed by the steering committee for a four-year  term traditional faroese food is mainly based on meat  seafood and potatoes and uses few fresh vegetables  mutton of the faroe sheep is the basis of many meals  and one of the most popular treats is skerpikjøt  well aged  wind-dried  mutton  which is quite chewy  the drying shed  known as a hjallur  is a standard feature in many faroese homes  particularly in the small towns and villages  other traditional foods are ræst kjøt (semi-dried  mutton  and ræstur fiskur  matured fish  another faroese specialty is tvøst og spik  pilot whale meat and blubber   a parallel meat fat dish made with offal is garnatálg   meat and blubber from a pilot whale means food for a long time  fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet  as do seabirds  such as faroese puffins  and their eggs  dried fish is also commonly eaten there are two breweries in the faroe islands  the first brewery is called föroya bjór and has produced beer since 1888  with exports mainly to iceland and denmark  the second brewery is called okkara bryggjarí and was founded in 2010.  a local specialty is fredrikk  a special brew made in nólsoy  production of hard alcohol such as snaps is forbidden in the faroe islands  hence the faroese akvavit is produced abroad since the friendly british occupation  the faroese have been fond of british food  in particular fish and chips and british-style  chocolate such as cadbury dairy milk  which is found in many of the island s shops  whereas in denmark this is scarce there are records of drive hunts in the faroe islands dating from whaling in the faroe islands is regulated by faroese authorities but not by the international whaling commission as there are disagreements about the commission s legal authority to regulate cetacean hunts  hundreds of long-finned  pilot whales  globicephala melaena  could be killed in a year  mainly during the summer  the hunts  called grindadráp in faroese  are non-commercial  and are organized on a community level  anyone can participate  when a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised when a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun  faroese animal welfare legislation  which also applies to whaling  requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible  a regulation spinal lance is used to sever the spinal cord  which also severs the major blood supply to the brain  ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds  the spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and has been shown to reduce killing time to 1–2   grindadráp  is legal and provides food for many people in the faroe however  a study has found whale meat and blubber to currently be contaminated with mercury and not recommended for human consumption  as too much may cause such adverse health effects as birth defects of the nervous system  high blood pressure  damaged immune system  increased risk for developing parkinson s disease  hypertension  arteriosclerosis  and diabetes mellitus type 2:therefore  we recommend that adults eat no more than one to two meals a month  women who plan to become pregnant within three months  pregnant women  and nursing women should abstain from eating pilot whale meat  pilot whale liver and kidneys should not be eaten at faroese islanders consider the hunt an important part of their culture and history  animal rights groups  such as the sea shepherd conservation society  criticize it as being cruel and unnecessary  since it in their point of view is no longer necessary as a food source for the faroese people  while the hunters claim in return that most journalists do not exhibit sufficient knowledge of the catch methods or its economic significance the sustainability of the faroese pilot whale hunt has been discussed  but with a long-term  average catch of around 800  pilot whales on the faroe islands a year the hunt is not considered to have a significant impact on the pilot whale population  there are an estimated 128,000  pilot whales in the northeast atlantic  and faroese whaling is therefore considered a sustainable catch by the faroese annual records of whale drives and strandings of pilot whales and other small cetaceans provide over 400  years of documentation  including statistics  and represents one of the most comprehensive historical records of wildlife utilization anywhere in the faroe islands have competed in every biennial island games since they were established in 1985.  the games were hosted by the islands in 1989  and faroes won the

available to local villages—mainly wool  garments include jumpers  scarves  and gloves  faroese jumpers have distinct nordic patterns  each village has some regional variations handed down from mother to daughter  there has recently been a strong revival of interest in faroese knitting  with young people knitting and wearing updated versions of old patterns emphasized by strong colours and bold patterns  this appears to be a reaction to the loss of traditional lifestyles  and as a way to maintain and assert cultural tradition in a rapidly-changing  society  many young people study and move abroad  and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific faroese heritage there has also been a great interest in faroese from the tv series the killing  where the main actress  detective inspector sarah lund  played by sofie gråbøl  wears faroese needed lace knitting is a traditional handicraft  the most distinctive trait of faroese lace shawls is the centre-back  gusset shaping  each shawl consists of two triangular side panels  a trapezoid-shaped  back gusset  an edge treatment  and usually shoulder shaping  these are worn by all generations of women  particularly as part of the traditional faroese costume as an overgarment the traditional faroese national dress is also a local handicraft that people spend a lot of time  money  and effort to assemble  it is worn at weddings and traditional dancing events  and on feast days  the cultural significance of the garment should not be underestimated  both as an expression of local and national identity and a passing on and reinforcing of traditional skills that bind local communities together a young faroese person is normally handed down a set of children s faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation  children are confirmed at age 14,  and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit  which is considered as a rite of passage  traditionally the aim would have been to complete the outfit by the time a young person was ready to marry and wear the clothes at the ceremony—though it is mainly only men who do this now each piece is intricately hand-knitted,  dyed  woven or embroidered to the specifications of the wearer  for example  the man s waistcoat is put together by hand in bright blue  red or black fine wool  the front is then intricately embroidered with colourful silk threads  often by a female relative  the motifs are often local faroese flowers or herbs  after this  a row of faroese-made  solid silver buttons are sewn on the outfit women wear embroidered silk  cotton or wool shawls and pinafores that can take months to weave or embroider with local flora and fauna  they are also adorned with a handwoven black and red ankle-length  skirt  knitted black and red jumper  a velvet belt  and black 18th  century style shoes with silver buckles  the outfit is held together by a row of solid silver buttons  silver chains and locally-made  silver brooches and belt buckles  often fashioned with viking style motifs both men s and women s national dress are extremely costly and can take many years to assemble  women in the family often work together to assemble the outfits  including knitting the close-fitting  jumpers  weaving and embroidering  sewing and assembling the national dress this tradition binds together
