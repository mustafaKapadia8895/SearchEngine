 drop  liquid  -  wikipediaa drop or droplet is a small column of liquid  bounded completely or almost completely by free surfaces  a drop may form when liquid accumulates at the lower end of a tube or other surface boundary  producing a hanging drop called a pendant drop  drops may also be formed by the condensation of a vapor or by atomization of a larger mass of liquid liquid forms drops because the liquid exhibits surface simple way to form a drop is to allow liquid to flow slowly from the lower end of a vertical tube of small diameter  the surface tension of the liquid causes the liquid to hang from the tube  forming a pendant  when the drop exceeds a certain size it is no longer stable and detaches itself  the falling liquid is also a drop held together by surface tension in the pendant drop test  a drop of liquid is suspended from the end of a tube by surface tension  the force due to surface tension is proportional to the length of the boundary between the liquid and the tube  with the proportionality constant usually denoted γ   displaystyle  gamma   since the length of this boundary is the circumference of the tube  the force due to surface tension is given bywhere d is the tube diameter the mass m of the drop hanging from the end of the tube can be found by equating the force due to gravity   f g   m g   displaystyle f  g  mg    with the component of the surface tension in the vertical direction   f γ sin ⁡ α   displaystyle f   gamma   sin  alpha     giving the formulawhere α is the angle of contact with the tube  and g is the acceleration due to gravity the limit of this formula  as α goes to 90°,  gives the maximum weight of a pendant drop for a liquid with a given surface tension  γ   displaystyle  gamma    this relationship is the basis of a convenient method of measuring surface tension  commonly used in the petroleum industry  more sophisticated methods are available to take account of the developing shape of the pendant as the drop grows  these methods are used if the surface tension is medicine  droppers and iv infusion sets have a standardized diameter  in such a way that 1  millilitre is equivalent to 20  drops  and  for the cases when smaller amounts are necessary  such as paediatrics   microdroppers or paediatric infusion sets are used  in which 1  millilitre   60  microdrops the drop adhesion to a solid can be divided to two categories  lateral adhesion and normal adhesion  lateral adhesion resembles friction  though tribologically lateral adhesion is a more accurate term  and refers to the force required to slide a drop on the surface  namely the force to detach the drop from its position on the surface only to translate it to another position on the surface  normal adhesion is the adhesion required to detach a drop from the surface in the normal direction  namely the force to cause the drop to fly off from the surface  the measurement of both adhesion forms can be done with the centrifugal adhesion balance  cab   the cab uses a combination of centrifugal and gravitational forces to obtain any ratio of lateral and normal forces  for example  it can apply a normal force at zero lateral force for the drop to fly off away from the surface in the normal direction or it can induce a lateral force at zero normal force  simulating zero gravity  the term droplet is a diminutive form of  drop  -  and as a guide is typically used for liquid particles of less than 500  µm diameter  in spray application  droplets are usually described by their perceived size  i e   diameter  whereas the dose  or number of infective particles in the case of biopesticides  is a function of their volume  this increases by a cubic function relative to diameter  thus a 50  µm droplet represents a dose in 65  pl and a 500  µm drop represents a dose in 65  nanolitres a droplet with a diameter of 3  mm has a terminal velocity of approximately 8  drops smaller than 1  mm in diameter will attain 95%  of their terminal velocity within 2  m  but above this size the distance to get to terminal velocity increases sharply  an example is a drop with a diameter of 2  mm that may achieve this at 5.6  to the different refractive index of water and air  refraction and reflection occur on the surfaces of raindrops  leading to rainbow formation the major source of sound when a droplet hits a liquid surface is the resonance of excited bubbles trapped underwater  these oscillating bubbles are responsible for most liquid sounds  such as running water or splashes  as they actually consist of many drop-liquid  classic shape associated with a drop  with a pointy end in its upper side  comes from the observation of a droplet clinging to a surface  the shape of a drop falling through a gas is actually more or less spherical for drops less than 2mm  in larger drops tend to be flatter on the bottom part due to the pressure of the gas they move as a result  as drops get larger  a concave depression forms which leads to the eventual breakup of the drop raindrop sizes typically range from 0.5  mm to 4  mm  with size distributions quickly decreasing past diameters larger than 2-2.5  traditionally thought that the variation in the size of raindrops was due to collisions on the way down to the ground  in 2009  french researchers succeeded in showing that the distribution of sizes is due to the drops  interaction with air  which deforms larger drops and causes them to fragment into smaller drops  effectively limiting the largest raindrops to about 6  mm however  drops up to 10  mm  equivalent in volume to a sphere of radius 4.5  mm  are theoretically stable and could be levitated in a wind the largest recorded raindrop was 8.8  mm in diameter  located at the base of a cumulus congestus cloud in the vicinity of kwajalein atoll in july 1999.  a raindrop of identical size was detected over northern brazil in september dye being dropped in a saucer of milk impact of a drop of water backjet from drop impact a drop of water hitting a metal surface  crown formation due to splashing of droplet a drop of water hitting a wet metal surface and ejecting more droplets  which become water globules and skim across the surface of the water a drop of water on a leaf   hydrophobic effect  partial wetting a triple backjet after impact photo of a raindrop on a fern frond detaching drop water droplets forming out of a shower head a drop of water on an asteraceaedroplets of water refracting a small flower a raindrop on a leafwater droplets on glass fountain water droplets as seen in very short exposurerain droplets on rose plant leaf
