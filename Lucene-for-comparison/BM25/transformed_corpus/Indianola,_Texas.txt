victoria  texas  metropolitan statistical area  in 1875,  the city had a population of 5,000,  but on september 15  of that year  a powerful hurricane struck  killing between 150  and 300  and almost entirely destroying the town  indianola was rebuilt  only to be wiped out on august 19,  1886,  by another intense hurricane  which was followed by a fire  indianola was designated a recorded texas historic landmark in 1963,  marker number carl of solms-braunfels,  representing the adelsverein  selected indian point in december  1844  as port of entry for the verein colonists from germany  prince solms renamed the port carlshafen in honor of himself  count carl of and count victor august of whom solms claimed had been christened carl  prince solms  choice of carlshafen and its inadequate accommodations as a port of entry  as well as the isolated route to new braunfels  was to keep the germans from interacting with any in february 1845  henry francis fisher conspired with dr  f  schubbert to coerce incoming immigrants to sign legal documents disassociating themselves from the verein and to join schubbert s colony in milam may 1846,  meusebach received a letter from count castell informing him 4,304  colonists were on their way to texas  with no funds and no new settlements  the mass of emigrants were stalled at carlshafen  meusebach s requests to the verein for more money  and his warnings at pending bankruptcy for the verein  brought no results  as a last resort  meusebach instructed d h  klaener to publish the plight in the german news media  embarrassed by the publicity  the verein established an inadequate $60,000  letter of meusebach had arranged with the torrey brothers for transporting the emigrants inland  but the united states hired the torrey

point  later indianola  in august  of these immigrants purchased land from samuel white and established a settlement at indian point  the name of the settlement changed to indianola in 1849  by combining the word  indian  with  ola   the spanish word for wave  the german immigrants continued to refer to the community as carlshaven  carl s harbor  in honor of prince carl of its founding in 1846,  indianola served as a major port  and before the 1875  storm was second only to galveston as texas s primary port  the town incorporated in 1853.  in 1856,  the port received cargoes of camels  part of the us army camel corps experiment to replace horses and mules as the primary pack animal in the southwestern parts of the country during the american civil war  indianola was twice occupied by union troops  in october 1862  and november 1863.  during the second occupation  part of a union infantry regiment moving from indianola to matagorda island drowned in matagorda bay in 1869,  the world s first mechanically-refrigerated  shipment of beef left indianola for new orleans during world war ii  the u s  army constructed an anti-aircraft  firing range along the indianola shoreline to train gunners and the facility was used primarily by military personnel from camp hulen  located outside of palacios having survived severe storms before  indianola was almost totally destroyed on 16  september 1875.  the new york times reported in detail on the extensive loss of life and property  even the lighthouses were swept and the keepers  including thomas h  mayne and edward flick jr  of the east shoal lighthouse  town was rebuilt but events were repeated in 1886.  the destruction served as an object lesson for many residents of galveston  100  miles up the texas coast  however  their calls for a seawall to protect that city went unheeded  and galveston nearly shared indianola s fate when the galveston hurricane of 1900  struck the island a railroad was intended to connect the port of indianola to san antonio  after the two storms  discouraged investors abandoned the venture and made galveston the port of choice  after galveston s hurricane  shipping traffic recentered over time to inland houston after the 1886  storm  the county seat was moved to port lavaca  on october 4,  1887,  the post office in indianola was permanently closed and the town declared today  almost nothing remains of the original indianola  as  due to storm erosion  most of the site of the city is now under water  a granite marker was placed on the shore at the nearest point to the indianola courthouse  now 300  feet  about 90  meters  away in matagorda bay  it reads   calhoun county courthouse  edward beaumont  architect 1859.  during the storms of 1875  and 1886,  precious lives were saved within its walls of shell  concrete  and lime  abandoned 1886."  the site is also home to a statue of rené-robert  cavelier  sieur de la salle indianola is now the site of a small unincorporated fishing village in elizabeth hand s novel aestival tide  a reconstructed indianola is featured as the lowermost level of the central ziggurat in the dome city of the novel matagorda by author louis l amour  much of the action took place in indianola  texas on the day it was destroyed by the 1875  hurricane  the courthouse  the site of which is now underwater out in the bay  was featured as the last refuge of the part i of isaac s storm  in the chapter  galveston  an absurd delusion   pages 79–84),  erik larson describes the two storms that ravaged indianola and the significance of these storms for galveston  texas  leading up to the galveston storm of he notes   at first  galveston s leading men seemed to grasp the significance of the indianola storms  anyone who looked at a map could see that galveston was even more vulnerable to destruction than indianola  it had no picket of barrier islands to shelter it  no buffer of mainland prairie  the city faced the gulf head-on."  he further observes   six weeks after the second indianola storm  a group of thirty prominent galveston residents calling themselves the progressive association met and resolved to build a seawall   and  the city s evening tribune endorsed the plan   however  although  the state eventually did authorize a bond to pay for the work   the city s engineer e m  hartwick observed   this was some months after the flood  and by then the attitude was  oh  we ll never get another one--and  they didn t build  larson criticizes meteorologist isaac cline  among others  for this failure  for example  larson cites statements cline published in the july 1891  galveston news article   west india in part iii of isaac s storm  in a chapter titled  ritter s cafe  you can t frighten me   larson publishes the recollections of mollie cohen  whose impressions of the galveston storm of 1900  reminded her of the second indianola hurricane singer songwriter  charlie robison  included a song titled  indianola  on the 1998  album life of the party that is a specific reference to indianola  texas  the song begins from the perspective of a german immigrant approaching indianola by sea and chronicling details of the narrator s family  the narrator and his cousin attempt to traverse the south to join the union army in the american civil war  though they encounter rebel resistance in indianola  tx  the next scene of the folk song briefly addresses the stock market crash of 1929  in an indirect fashion  noting that little change occurred in their respective lives other than rust s accumulating on wagon wheels  while this verse is brief in regards to words and time  it denotes a subtle and increasing disaffection in the american texan experience  adversely affected by seemingly non-relevant  incidences  the storyline then progresses to world war ii  introducing an internal struggle between the call of duty of the united states of america and its armed conflict with germany  the ancestral point of origin of many americans  the overall sentiment of the song begins as a story of new promises followed by a series of fictional  though personally carved facts  that illustrate a common experience for the individualist  texas exemplifies a spirit that is not only uniquely a texan story  but an american one  thrusting the individual against the external influence that would assume its right to assert its own values  this  however  should not be confused with contemporary movements deviating from the spirit of this song singer songwriter brian burns included the song  indianola  on his 2004  album  heavy weather   the lyrics of the song chronicle the full life cycle of indianola with verses from the points of view of a personified matagorda bay  an immigrant who helped build the city  johann   a worker who came to help  bury the lost souls who perished that day   isaac   and finally the songwriter himself visiting the site  brian   it is unclear whether the  johann  mentioned in verse three refers to the johann dethardt  the first ship to bring settlers into the area  or johann swartz  the owner builder of the first home erected in what would become is now indianola is
