 turboprop -  wikipediaa turboprop engine is a turbine engine that drives an aircraft in contrast to a turbojet  the engine s exhaust gases do not contain enough energy to create significant thrust  since almost all of the engine s power is used to drive the propeller in its simplest form a turboprop consists of an intake  compressor  combustor  turbine  and a propelling nozzle  air is drawn into the intake and compressed by the compressor  fuel is then added to the compressed air in the combustor  where the fuel-air  mixture then combusts  the hot combustion gases expand through the turbine  some of the power generated by the turbine is used to drive the compressor  the rest is transmitted through the reduction gearing to the propeller  further expansion of the gases occurs in the propelling nozzle  where the gases exhaust to atmospheric pressure  the propelling nozzle provides a relatively small proportion of the thrust generated by a turboprop exhaust thrust in a turboprop is sacrificed in favor of shaft power  which is obtained by extracting additional power  up to that necessary to drive the compressor  from turbine expansion  owing to the additional expansion in the turbine system  the residual energy in the exhaust jet is consequently  the exhaust jet typically produces around or less than 10%  of the total a higher proportion of the thrust comes from the propeller at low speeds and less at higher turboprops can have bypass ratios up to although the propulsion airflow is less clearly defined for propellers than for propeller is coupled to the turbine through a reduction gear that converts the high rpm low torque output to low rpm high torque  the propeller itself is normally a constant speed  variable pitch  type similar to that used with larger reciprocating aircraft needed unlike the small diameter fans used in turbofan jet engines  the propeller has a large diameter that lets it accelerate a large volume of air  this permits a lower airstream velocity for a given amount of thrust  as it is more efficient at low speeds to accelerate a large amount of air by a small degree than a small amount of air by a large a low disc loading  thrust per disc area  increases the aircraft s energy efficiency  and this reduces the fuel lose efficiency as aircraft speed increases  so turboprops are normally not used on high-speed  above mach however  propfan engines  which are very similar to turboprop engines  can cruise at flight speeds approaching mach 0.75.  to increase propeller efficiency  a mechanism can be used to alter their pitch relative to the airspeed  a variable-pitch  propeller  also called a controllable-pitch  propeller  can also be used to generate negative thrust while decelerating on the runway  additionally  in the event of an engine outage  the pitch can be adjusted to a vaning pitch  called feathering   thus minimizing the drag of the non-functioning  needed while most modern turbojet and turbofan engines use axial-flow  compressors  turboprop engines usually contain at least one stage of centrifugal compression  centrifugal compressors have the advantage of being simple and lightweight  at the expense of a streamlined needed while the power turbine may be integral with the gas generator section  many turboprops today feature a free power turbine on a separate coaxial shaft  this enables the propeller to rotate freely  independent of compressor residual thrust on a turboshaft is avoided by further expansion in the turbine system and or truncating and turning the exhaust 180  degrees  to produce two opposing jets  apart from the above  there is very little difference between a turboprop and a arnold griffith had published a paper on turbine design in 1926.  subsequent work at the royal aircraft establishment investigated axial turbine designs that could be used to supply power to a shaft and thence a propeller  from 1929,  frank whittle began work on centrifugal turbine designs that would deliver pure jet world s first turboprop was designed by the hungarian mechanical engineer györgy jendrassik published a turboprop idea in 1928,  and on 12  march 1929  he patented his invention  in 1938,  he built a small-scale  (100  hp  74.6  kw  experimental gas the larger jendrassik cs-1,  with a predicted output of 1,000  bhp  was produced and tested at the ganz works in budapest between 1937  and 1941.  it was of axial-flow  design with 15  compressor and 7  turbine stages  annular combustion chamber and many other modern features  first run in 1940,  combustion problems limited its output to 400  bhp  in 1941,the  engine was abandoned due to war  and the factory was turned over to conventional engine production  the world s first turboprop engine that went into mass production was designed by a german engineer  max adolf mueller  in first mention of turboprop engines in the general public press was in the february 1944  issue of the british aviation publication flight  which included a detailed cutaway drawing of what a possible future turboprop engine could look like  the drawing was very close to what the future rolls-royce  trent would look the first british turboprop engine was the rolls-royce  rb.50  trent  a converted derwent ii fitted with reduction gear and a rotol 7  ft 11  in (2.41  m  five-bladed  propeller  two trents were fitted to gloster meteor ee227  — the sole "trent-meteor"  — which thus became the world s first turboprop-powered  aircraft  albeit a test-bed  not intended for it first flew on 20  september 1945.  from their experience with the trent  rolls-royce  developed the rolls-royce  clyde  the first turboprop engine to be fully type certificated for military and civil and the dart  which became one of the most reliable turboprop engines ever built  dart production continued for more than fifty years  the dart-powered  vickers viscount was the first turboprop aircraft of any kind to go into production and sold in large it was also the first four-engined  turboprop  its first flight was on 16  july 1948.  the world s first single engined turboprop aircraft was the armstrong siddeley mamba-powered  boulton paul balliol  which first flew on 24  march soviet union built on german world war ii development by junkers motorenwerke  while bmw  heinkel-hirth  and daimler-benz  also developed and partially tested needed  while the soviet union had the technology to create the airframe for a jet-powered  strategic bomber comparable to boeing s b-52  stratofortress  they instead produced the tupolev tu-95  bear  powered with four kuznetsov nk-12  turboprops  mated to eight contra-rotating  propellers  two per nacelle  with supersonic tip speeds to achieve maximum cruise speeds in excess of 575  mph  faster than many of the first jet aircraft and comparable to jet cruising speeds for most missions  the bear would serve as their most successful long-range  combat and surveillance aircraft and symbol of soviet power projection throughout the end of the 20th  century  the usa would incorporate contra-rotating  turboprop engines  such as the ill-fated  twin-turbine  allison t40  — essentially a twinned up pair of allison t38  turboprop engines driving contra-rotating  propellers — into a series of experimental aircraft during the 1950s,  with aircraft powered with the t40,  like the convair r3y  tradewind flying boat never entering u s  navy service the first american turboprop engine was the general electric xt31,  first used in the experimental consolidated vultee the xp-81  first flew in december 1945,  the first aircraft to use a combination of turboprop and turbojet power  the technology of the allison s earlier t38  design evolved into the allison t56,  with quartets of the t56s  being used to power the lockheed electra airliner  its military maritime patrol derivative the p-3  orion  and the widely produced c-130  hercules military transport aircraft  one of the most produced turboprop engines used in civil aviation is the pratt   whitney canada pt6  needed the first turbine-powered,  shaft-driven  helicopter was the kaman k-225,  a development of charles kaman s k-125  synchropter  which used a boeing t50  turboshaft engine to power it on 11  december to turbofans  turboprops are most efficient at flight speeds below 725  km h (450  mph  390  knots  because the jet velocity of the propeller  and exhaust  is relatively low  modern turboprop airliners operate at nearly the same speed as small regional jet airliners but burn two-thirds  of the fuel per however  compared to a turbojet  which can fly at high altitude for enhanced speed and fuel efficiency  a propeller aircraft has a lower ceiling the most common application of turboprop engines in civilian aviation is in small commuter aircraft  where their greater power and reliability offsets their higher initial cost and fuel consumption  turboprop-powered  aircraft have become popular for bush airplanes such as the cessna caravan and quest kodiak as jet fuel is easier to obtain in remote areas than needed  due to the high price of turboprop engines  they are mostly used where high-performance  short-takeoff  and landing  stol  capability and efficiency at modest flight speeds are required turboprop engines are generally used on small subsonic aircraft  but the tupolev tu-114  can reach 470  kt (870  km h  541  mph   large military and civil aircraft  such as the lockheed l-188  electra and the tupolev tu-95,  have also used turboprop power  the airbus a400m  is powered by four europrop tp400  engines  which are the third most powerful turboprop engines ever produced  after the eleven megawatt-output  kuznetsov nk-12  and 10.4  mw-output
