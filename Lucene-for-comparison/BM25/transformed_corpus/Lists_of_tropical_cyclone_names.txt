 tropical cyclone naming -  wikipediatropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones are named by various warning centers to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts  watches  and warnings  the names are intended to reduce confusion in the event of concurrent storms in the same basin  generally once storms produce sustained wind speeds of more than 33  knots (61  km h  38  mph   names are assigned in order from predetermined lists depending on which basin they originate  however  standards vary from basin to basin  some tropical depressions are named in the western pacific  while tropical cyclones must have a significant amount of gale-force  winds occurring around the centre before they are named in the southern hemisphere before the formal start of naming  tropical cyclones were named after places  objects  or saints  feast days on which they occurred  the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the queensland government meteorologist clement wragge  who named systems between 1887  and 1907.  this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired  until it was revived in the latter part of world war ii for the western pacific  formal naming schemes and naming lists have subsequently been introduced and developed for the eastern  central  western and southern pacific basins  as well as the australian region  atlantic ocean and indian ocean before the formal start of naming  tropical cyclones were often named after places  objects  or saints  feast days on which they the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the queensland government meteorologist clement wragge  who named systems between 1887  and this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of world war ii for the western formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the north atlantic  eastern  central  western and southern pacific basins as well as the australian region and indian present  tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven warning centers and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to facilitate the effective communication of forecasts and storm-related  hazards to the general this is especially important when multiple storms are occurring simultaneously in the same ocean names are generally assigned in order from predetermined lists  once they produce one  three  or ten-minute  sustained wind speeds of more than 65  km h (40  however  standards vary from basin to basin  with some systems named in the western pacific when they develop into tropical depressions or enter pagasa s area of within the southern hemisphere  systems must be characterized by a significant amount of gale-force  winds occurring around the center before they are member of the world meteorological organization s hurricane  typhoon and tropical cyclone committees can request that the name of a tropical cyclone be retired or withdrawn from the various tropical cyclone naming a name is retired or withdrawn if a consensus or majority of members agree that the system has acquired a special notoriety  such as causing a large number of deaths and amounts of damage  impact  or for other special a replacement name is then submitted to the committee concerned and voted upon  but these names can be rejected and replaced with another name for various these reasons include the spelling and pronunciation of the name  the similarity to the name of a recent tropical cyclone or on another list of names  and the length of the name for modern communication channels such as social pagasa also retires the names of significant tropical cyclones when they have caused at least 7009100000000000000♠₱1  billion in damage or have caused at least 300  the north atlantic ocean  tropical or subtropical cyclones are named by the national hurricane center  nhc rsmc miami  when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storms with winds of at least 34  kn (39  mph  63  there are six lists of names which rotate every six years and begin with the first letters a—w used  skipping q and u  and alternating between male and female the names of significant tropical cyclones are retired from the lists  with a replacement name selected at the next world meteorological organization s hurricane committee if all of the names on a list are used  storms are named after the letters of the greek current naming scheme began with the 1979  season  it uses alternating women s and men s names  and also includes some spanish and a few french names  before then  only women s names were used within the eastern pacific ocean  there are two warning centers that assign names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the world meteorological organization when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least 34  kn (39  mph  63  tropical cyclones that intensify into tropical storms between the coast of americas and 140°w  are named by the national hurricane center  nhc rsmc miami   while tropical cyclones intensifying into tropical storms between 140°w  and 180°  are named by the central pacific hurricane center  cphc rsmc significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists and a replacement name selected at the next world meteorological organization hurricane current naming scheme began with the 1978  season  one year before the atlantic basin  and which anomalously used the list that will be used next in 2018,  rather than the one for 2020).  as with the atlantic basin  it uses alternating women s and men s names  and also includes some spanish and a few french names  before then  only women s names were used  because eastern pacific hurricanes mainly threaten western mexico and central america  the lists contain more spanish names than the atlantic lists when a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical storm to the north of the equator between the coastline of the americas and 140°w,  it will be named by the nhc  there are six lists of names which rotate every six years and begin with the letters a—z used  skipping q and u  with each name alternating between a male or a female the names of significant tropical cyclones are retired from the lists  with a replacement name selected at the next world meteorological organization s hurricane if all of the names on a list are used  storms are named using the letters of the greek a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical storm to the north of the equator between 140°w  and 180°,  it is named by the four lists of hawaiian names are maintained by the world meteorological organization s hurricane committee  rotating without regard to year  with the first name for a new year being the next name in sequence that was not used the previous significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists  with a replacement name selected at the next hurricane committee cyclones that occur within the northern hemisphere between the anti-meridian  and 100°e  are officially named by the japan meteorological agency when they become tropical however  pagasa also names tropical cyclones that occur or develop into tropical depressions within their self-defined  area of responsibility between 5°n–25°n  and this often results in tropical cyclones in the region having two cyclones within the western pacific are assigned international names by the jma when they become a tropical storm with 10-minute  sustained winds of at least 34  kn (39  mph  63  the names are used sequentially without regard to year and are taken from five lists of names that were prepared by the escap wmo typhoon committee  after each of the 14  members submitted 10  names in the order of the names to be used was determined by placing the english name of the members in alphabetical members of the committee are allowed to request the retirement or replacement of a system s name if it causes extensive destruction or for other reasons such as number of unlike other basins  storms are also named after plants  animals  objects  and mythological beings since 1963,  pagasa has independently operated its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones that occur within its own self-defined  philippine area of the names are taken from four different lists of 25  names and are assigned when a system moves into or develops into a tropical depression within pagasa s the four lists of names are rotated every four years  with the names of significant tropical cyclones retired should they have caused at least 7009100000000000000♠₱1  billion in damage and or at least 300  deaths within the should the list of names for a given year be exhausted  names are taken from an auxiliary list  the first ten of which are published every the north indian ocean between 45°e  – 100°e,  tropical cyclones are named by the india meteorological department  imd rsmc new delhi  when they are judged to have intensified into a cyclonic storm with 3-minute  sustained wind speeds of at least 34  kn (39  mph  63  there are eight lists of names which are used in sequence and are not rotated every few years  however  the names of significant tropical cyclones are the south-west  indian ocean in the southern hemisphere between africa and 90°e,  a tropical or subtropical disturbance is named when it is judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least 34  kn (39  mph  63  this is defined as being when gales are either observed or estimated to be present near a significant portion of the system s systems are named in conjunction with météo-france  reunion by either météo madagascar or the mauritius meteorological if a disturbance reaches the naming stage between africa and 55°e,  then météo madagascar names it  if it reaches the naming stage between 55°e  and 90°e,  then the mauritius meteorological service names the names are taken from three pre-determined  lists of names  which rotate on a triennial basis  with any names that have been used automatically the names that are going to be used during a season are selected in advance by the world meteorological organization s ra i tropical cyclone committee from names submitted by member the australian region in the southern hemisphere between 90°e  – 160°e,  a tropical cyclone is named when observations or dvorak intensity analysis indicate that a system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to the indonesian badan meteorologi  klimatologi  dan geofisika names systems that develop between the equator and 10°s  and 90°e  and 141°e,  while papua new guinea s national weather service names systems that develop between the equator and 10°s  and 141°e  and outside of these areas  the australian bureau of meteorology names systems that develop into tropical if a name is assigned to a tropical cyclone that causes loss of life or significant damage and disruption to the way of life of a community  then the name assigned to that storm is retired from the list of names for the a replacement name is then submitted to the next world meteorological organization s ra v tropical cyclone committee a system intensifies into a tropical cyclone between the equator-10°s  and 90°e-141°e,  it will be named by the badan meteorologi  klimatologi  dan geofisika  bmkg tcwc names are assigned in sequence from list a  while list b details names that will replace names on list a that are retired or removed for other a system

from list a and are automatically retired after being used regardless of any damage list b contains names that will replace names on list a that are retired or removed for other a system develops into a tropical cyclone below 10°s  between 90°e  and 160°e,  then it will be named by the australian bureau of meteorology  bom  which operates three tropical cyclone warning centres in perth  darwin  and the names are assigned in alphabetical order and used in rotating order without regard to the southern pacific basin in the southern hemisphere between 160°e  – 120°w,  a tropical cyclone is named when observations or dvorak intensity analysis indicate that a system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to the fiji meteorological service  fms  names systems that are located between the equator and 25°s,  while the new zealand metservice names systems  in conjunction with the fms  that develop to the south of if a tropical cyclone causes loss of life or significant damage and disruption to the way of life of a community  then the name assigned to that cyclone is retired from the list of names for the a replacement name is then submitted to the next world meteorological organization s ra v tropical cyclone committee the name of a tropical cyclone is determined by using lists a — d in order  without regard to year before restarting with list list
