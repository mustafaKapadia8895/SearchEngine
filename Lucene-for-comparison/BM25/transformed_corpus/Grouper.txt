 grouper -  wikipediaalphestes anyperodon aethaloperca cephalopholis chromileptes dermatolepis epinephelus gonioplectrus gracila hyporthodus mycteroperca paranthias plectropomus saloptia triso variolagroupers are fish of any of a number of genera in the subfamily epinephelinae of the family serranidae  in the order perciformes not all serranids are called groupers  the family also includes the sea basses  the common name grouper is usually given to fish in one of two large genera  epinephelus and mycteroperca  in addition  the species classified in the small genera anyperidon  cromileptes  dermatolepis  gracila  saloptia  and triso are also called groupers  fish in the genus plectropomus are referred to as coralgroupers  these genera are all classified in the subfamily epiphelinae  however  some of the hamlets  genus alphestes   the hinds  genus cephalopholis   the lyretails  genus variola  and some other small genera  gonioplectrus  niphon  paranthias  are also in this subfamily  and occasional species in other serranid genera have common names involving the word  grouper   nonetheless  the word  grouper  on its own is usually taken as meaning the subfamily epinephelinae the word  grouper  is from the portuguese name  garoupa  the origin of this name in portuguese is believed to be from an indigenous south american australia   groper  is used instead of  grouper  for several species  such as the queensland grouper  epinephelus lanceolatus   in the philippines  it is named lapu-lapu  in luzon  while in the visayas and mindanao it goes by the name needed  in new zealand   groper  refers to a type of wreckfish  polyprion oxygeneios  which goes by the māori name in the middle east  the fish is known as hammour  and is widely eaten  especially in the persian gulf are teleosts  typically having a stout body and a large mouth  they are not built for long-distance,  fast swimming  they can be quite large  and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100  kg are not needed   though obviously in such a large group  species vary considerably  they swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it  they do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws  but they have heavy crushing tooth plates inside the pharynx  they habitually eat fish  octopuses  and crustaceans  some species prefer to ambush their prey  while other species are active predators  reports of fatal attacks on humans by the largest species  the giant grouper  epinephelus lanceolatus  are mouths and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance  they also use their mouths to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks  jetting it out through their gills research indicates roving coralgroupers  plectropomus pessuliferus  sometimes cooperate with giant morays in are mostly monandric protogynous hermaphrodites  i e  they mature only as females and have the ability to change sex after sexual some species of groupers grow about a kilogram per year and are generally adolescent until they reach three kilograms  when they become female  the largest males often control harems containing three to 15  groupers often pair spawn  which enables large males to competitively exclude smaller males from as such  if a small female grouper were to change sex before it could control a harem as a male  its fitness would if no male is available  the largest female that can increase fitness by changing sex will do some groupers are gonochorism  or a reproductive strategy with two distinct sexes  has evolved independently in groupers at least five the evolution of gonochorism is linked to group spawning high amounts of habitat both group spawning and habitat cover increase the likelihood of a smaller male to reproduce in the presence of large males  fitness of male groupers in environments where competitive exclusion of smaller males is not possible is correlated with sperm production and thus testicle gonochoristic groupers have larger testes than protogynous groupers (10%  of body mass compared to 1%  of body mass   indicating the evolution of gonochorism increased male grouper fitness in environments where large males were unable to competitively exclude small males from other fish  groupers harbour parasites  including nematodes  cestodes  monogeneans  isopods  and copepods  a study conducted in new caledonia has shown that coral reef-associated  groupers have about 10  species of parasites per fish species of pseudorhabdosynochus  monogeneans of the family diplectanidae are typical of and especially numerous on groupers many groupers are important food fish  and some of them are now farmed  unlike most other fish species which are chilled or frozen  groupers are usually sold live in many species are popular fish for sea-angling.  some species are small enough to be kept in aquaria  though even the small species are inclined to grow needed groupers are commonly reported as a source of ciguatera fish poisoning  dna barcoding of grouper species might help in controlling ciguatera fish poisoning since fish are easily identified  even from meal remnants  with molecular newspaper the star reported a 180-kg  grouper being caught off the waters near pulau sembilan in the straits of malacca in january shenzhen news in china reported that a 1.8-m  grouper swallowed a 1.0-m  whitetip reef shark at the fuzhou sea world september 2010,  a costa rican newspaper reported a 2.3-m  (7.5-ft)  grouper in cieneguita  limón  the weight of the fish was 250  kg (550  lb  and
