 multicellular thunderstorm -  wikipediaa multicellular thunderstorm cluster is a thunderstorm that is composed of multiple cells  each being at a different stage in the life cycle of a thunderstorm  it appears as several anvils clustered together  a cell is an updraft downdraft couplet  these different cells will dissipate as new cells form and continue the life of the multicellular thunderstorm cluster with each cell taking a turn as the dominant cell in the group the formation of multicellular thunderstorms imply that the updraft in the mother thunderstorm is offset from its downdraft  new cells usually form n the upwind  usually western or southwestern  part of the storm where the downdraft of the mature cells meet the environmental wind  lifting the air parcel and triggering new convection  the mature cells are thus usually in the center of the storm  and dissipating cells are usually in the downwind  usually eastern or northeastern  part of the multicellular cluster can last for hours while each individual cell should only last for about 20  to 60  minutes  these storms can sometimes be severe and sometimes have awkward paths due to the thunderstorm sometimes not following the path of the cells that compose the typical hodograph  plot of the wind versus altitude  associated with it shows a linear wind shear with the moderate vertical wind shear leads to the development of a non-symmetric  surface convergence associated with the thunderstorm outflow  with the strongest convergence taking place on the downwind side from the storm s motion  so individual while cells moves along the windshear while the line moves at 30Â°  of it  and 70%  of the mean wind speed in the convective available potential energy  cape  is moderate to large  usually between 800  and 1,500  the radar structure of this type of thunderstorm is characterized by overhangs of reflectivity in the southwestern part of the cluster any severe activity in one of these storms will most likely come from the dominant cell near or after its peak updraft strength  this is because there could be severe hail from a strong updraft that lasts only a short period of time  with damaging winds rain is an important impact of such systems  the speed and direction at which the entire cluster of thunderstorms move downstream make the difference in the amount of rain received in any one location  individual cells might move downstream but additional cells forming upwind of the cluster can move directly over the path of the previous cell  forming training multicellular storm can sometimes develop into a mesoscale convective system  mcs  or be a squall line  updrafts reform new cells continually at the leading edge of system with rain and hail following behind  individual thunderstorm updrafts and downdrafts along the line can become strong  producing large hail and strong outflow of straight-line  winds ahead of system  tornadoes are only occasionally in certain conditions  squall line can extend on a very long line  moving extremely rapidly  and become a derecho
