 last glacial maximum -  wikipediathe last glacial maximum  lgm  was the last period in the earth s climate history during the last glacial period when ice sheets were at their greatest extension  growth of the ice sheets reached their maximum positions at about 26.5  kbp  deglaciation commenced in the northern hemisphere at approximately 20  kbp and in antarctica approximately at 14.5  kbp  which is consistent with evidence that it was the primary source for an abrupt rise in the sea level at about 14.5  the lgm is referred to in britain as the dimlington stadial  and dated by nick ashton between 31,000  and 16,000  ice sheets covered much of north america  northern europe  and asia  the ice sheets profoundly affected earth s climate by causing drought  desertification  and a dramatic drop in sea it was followed by the late glacial the formation of an ice sheet or ice cap requires both prolonged cold and precipitation  snow   hence  despite having temperatures similar to those of glaciated areas in north america and europe  east asia remained unglaciated except at higher elevations  this difference was because the ice sheets in europe produced extensive anticyclones above them these anticyclones generated air masses that were so dry on reaching siberia and manchuria that precipitation sufficient for the formation of glaciers could never occur  except in kamchatka where these westerly winds lifted moisture from the sea of japan   the relative warmth of the pacific ocean due to the shutting down of the oyashio current and the presence of large 'east-west'  mountain ranges were secondary factors preventing continental glaciation in asia all over the world  climates at the last glacial maximum were cooler and almost everywhere drier  in extreme cases  such as south australia and the sahel  rainfall could be diminished by up to 90%  from present  with florae diminished to almost the same degree as in glaciated areas of europe and north america  even in less affected regions  rainforest cover was greatly diminished  especially in west africa where a few refugia were surrounded by tropical grasslands the amazon rainforest was split into two large blocks by extensive savanna  and the tropical rainforests of southeast asia probably were similarly affected  with deciduous forests expanding in their place except on the east and west extremities of the sundaland shelf  only in central america and the chocó region of colombia did tropical rainforests remain substantially intact – probably due to the extraordinarily heavy rainfall of these regions most of the world s deserts expanded  exceptions were in what is now the western united states  where changes in the jet stream brought heavy rain to areas that are now desert and large pluvial lakes formed  the best known being lake bonneville in utah  this also occurred in afghanistan and iran  where a major lake formed in the dasht-e  kavir in australia  shifting sand dunes covered half the continent  whilst the chaco and pampas in south america became similarly dry  present-day  subtropical regions also lost most of their forest cover  notably in eastern australia  the atlantic forest of brazil  and southern china  where open woodland became dominant due to drier conditions  in northern china – unglaciated despite its cold climate – a mixture of grassland and tundra prevailed  and even here  the northern limit of tree growth was at least 20°  farther south than today in the period before the last glacial maximum  many areas that became completely barren desert were wetter than they are today  notably in southern australia  where aboriginal occupation is believed to coincide with a wet period between 40,000  and 60,000  years before present  bp  a formal measurement of uncalibrated radiocarbon years  counted from 1950  ce  during the last glacial maximum  much of the world was cold  dry  and inhospitable  with frequent storms and a dust-laden  atmosphere  the dustiness of the atmosphere is a prominent feature in ice cores  dust levels were as much as 20  to 25  times greater than this was probably due to a number of factors  reduced vegetation  stronger global winds  and less precipitation to clear dust from the the massive sheets of ice locked away water  lowering the sea level  exposing continental shelves  joining land masses together  and creating extensive coastal during the last glacial maximum  21,000  years ago  the sea level was about 125  meters  about 410  feet  lower than it is europe was largely covered by ice  the southern boundary of the ice sheets passing through germany and poland  this ice extended northward to cover svalbard and franz josef land and northeastward to occupy the barents sea  the kara sea and novaya zemlya  ending at the taymyr northwestern russia the fennoscandian ice sheet reached its lgm extent 17  ka bp  five thousand years later than in denmark  germany and western poland  outside the baltic shield  and in russia in particular  the lgm ice margin of the fennoscandian ice sheet was highly lobate  the main lgm lobes of russia followed the dvina  vologda and rybinsk basins respectively  lobes originated as result of ice following shallow topographic depressions filled with a soft sediment covered europe south of the ice sheet down to present-day  szeged in southern hungary  ice covered the whole of iceland and almost all of the british isles but southern england  britain was no more than a peninsula of europe  its north capped in ice  and its south a polar needed there were ice sheets in modern tibet  although scientists continue to debate the extent to which the tibetan plateau was covered with ice  as well as in baltistan and ladakh  in southeast asia  many smaller mountain glaciers formed  and permafrost covered asia as far south as beijing  because of lowered sea levels  many of today s islands were joined to the continents  the indonesian islands as far east as borneo and bali were connected to the asian continent in a landmass called sundaland  palawan was also part of sundaland  while the rest of the philippine islands formed one large island separated from the continent only by the sibutu passage and the mindoro africa and the middle east  many smaller mountain glaciers formed  and the sahara and other sandy deserts were greatly expanded in persian gulf averages about 35  metres in depth and the seabed between abu dhabi and qatar is even shallower  being mostly less than 15  metres deep  for thousands of years the ur-shatt   a confluence of the tigris-euphrates  rivers  provided fresh water to the gulf  as it flowed through the strait of hormuz into the gulf of oman bathymetric data suggests there were two palaeo-basins  in the persian gulf  the central basin may have approached an area of 20,000  km²  comparable at its fullest extent to lakes such as lake malawi in africa  between 12,000  and 9000  years ago much of the gulf floor would have remained exposed  only being flooded by the sea after 8,000  years is estimated that annual average temperatures in southern africa were 6°  c lower than at present during the last glacial maximum  this alone would however not have been enough to create a widespread glaciation or permafrost in the drakensberg mountains or the lesotho seasonal freezing of the ground in the lesotho highlands might have reached depths of 2  meter or more below the a few small glaciers did however develop during the last glacial maximum  in particular in south-facing  in the hex river mountains  in the western cape  block streams and terraces found near the summit of matroosberg evidences past periglacial activity which likely occurred during the last glacial australian mainland  new guinea  tasmania and many smaller islands comprised a single land mass  this continent is now referred to sometimes as sahul between sahul and sundaland – a peninsula of south east asia that comprised present-day  malaysia and western and northern indonesia – there remained an archipelago of islands known as wallacea  the water gaps between these islands  sahul and sundaland were considerably narrower and fewer in number in north america  the ice covered essentially all of canada and extended roughly to the missouri and ohio rivers  and eastward to manhattan  in addition to the large cordilleran ice sheet in canada and montana  alpine glaciers advanced and  in some locations  ice caps covered much of the rocky mountains further south  latitudinal gradients were so sharp that permafrost did not reach far south of the ice sheets except at high elevations  glaciers forced the early human populations who had originally migrated from northeast siberia into refugia  reshaping their genetic variation by mutation and drift  this phenomenon established the older haplogroups found among native americans  and later migrations are responsible for northern north american the island of hawaii  geologists have long recognized deposits formed by glaciers on mauna kea during recent ice ages  the latest work indicates that deposits of three glacial episodes since 150,000  to 200,000  years ago are preserved on the volcano  glacial moraines on the volcano formed about 70,000  years ago and from about 40,000  to 13,000  years ago  if glacial deposits were formed on mauna loa  they have long since been buried by younger lava the last glacial maximum valley glaciers in the southern andes (38–43°  s  merged and descended from the andes occupying lacustrine and marine basins where they spread out forming large piedmont glacier lobes  glaciers extended about 7  km west of the modern llanquihue lake but not more than 2  to 3  km south of it  nahuel huapi lake in argentina was also glaciated by the same over most chiloé glacier advance peaked in 26,000  yrs bp forming a long north-south  moraine system along the eastern coast of chiloé island (31.5–43°  s   by that time the glaciation at the latitude of chiloé was of ice sheet type contrasting to the valley glaciation found further north in glacier advances much of the area west of llanquihue lake was still ice-free  during the last glacial during the coldest period of the last glacial maximum vegetation at this location was dominated by alpine herbs in wide open surfaces  the global warming that followed caused a slow change in vegetation towards a sparsely distributed vegetation dominated by nothofagus within this parkland vegetation magellanic moorland alternated with nothofagus forest  and as warming progressed even warm-climate  trees begun to grow in the area  it is estimated that the tree line was depressed about 1000  m relative to present day elevations during the coldest period  but it rose gradually until 19,300  yr bp  at that time a cold reversal caused a replacement of much of the arboreal vegetation with magellanic moorland and alpine is known about the extent of glaciers during last glacial maximum north of the chilean lake district  to the north  in the dry andes of central and the last glacial maximum is associated with increased humidity and the verified advance of at least some mountain the southern hemisphere  the patagonian ice sheet covered the whole southern third of chile and adjacent areas of argentina  on the western side of the andes the ice sheet reached sea level as far north as in the 41  degrees south at chacao needed  the western coast of patagonia was largely glaciated  but some authors have pointed out the possible existence of ice-free  refugia for some plant species  on the eastern side of the andes  glacier lobes occupied the depressions of seno skyring  seno otway  inútil bay  and beagle channel  on the straits of
