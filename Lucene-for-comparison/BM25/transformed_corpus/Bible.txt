 bible -  wikipediaoutline of bible-related  topicsthe bible  from koine greek τὰ βιβλία  tà biblía   the is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that jews and christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between god and humans many different authors contributed to the bible  what is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups  a number of bible canons have evolved  with overlapping and diverging the christian old testament overlaps with the hebrew bible and the greek septuagint  the hebrew bible is known in judaism as the tanakh  the new testament is a collection of writings by early christians  believed to be mostly jewish disciples of christ  written in first-century  koine greek  these early christian greek writings consist of narratives  letters  and apocalyptic writings  among christian denominations there is some disagreement about the contents of the canon  primarily the apocrypha  a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect attitudes towards the bible also differ amongst christian groups  roman catholics  anglicans and eastern orthodox christians stress the harmony and importance of the bible and sacred tradition  while protestant churches focus on the idea of sola scriptura  or scripture alone  this concept arose during the protestant reformation  and many denominations today support the use of the bible as the only source of christian teaching with estimated total sales of over 5  billion copies  the bible is widely considered to be the best-selling  book of all it sells approximately 100  million copies and has been a major influence on literature and history  especially in the west  where the gutenberg bible was the first book printed using movable type the english word bible is from the latin biblia  from the same word in medieval latin and late latin and ultimately from koine greek τὰ βιβλία ta biblia  the books   singular βιβλίον latin biblia is short for biblia sacra  holy book   while biblia in greek and late latin is neuter plural  gen  bibliorum   it gradually came to be regarded as a feminine singular noun  biblia  gen  bibliae  in medieval latin  and so the word was loaned as a singular into the vernaculars of western latin biblia sacra  holy books  translates greek τὰ βιβλία τὰ ἅγια ta biblia ta hagia   the holy word βιβλίον itself had the literal meaning of  paper  or  scroll  and came to be used as the ordinary word for  book   it is the diminutive of βύβλος byblos   egyptian papyrus   possibly so called from the name of the phoenician sea port byblos  also known as gebal  from whence egyptian papyrus was exported to greece  the greek ta biblia  lit   little papyrus was  an expression hellenistic jews used to describe their sacred books  the christian use of the term can be traced to c  223  the biblical scholar f f  bruce notes that chrysostom appears to be the first writer  in his homilies on matthew  delivered between 386  and 388)  to use the greek phrase ta biblia   the books   to describe both the old and new testaments the 2nd  century bce  jewish groups began calling the books of the bible the  scriptures  and they referred to them as  holy   or in hebrew כִּתְבֵי הַקֹּדֶשׁ  kitvei hakkodesh   and christians now commonly call the old and new testaments of the christian bible  the holy bible   in greek τὰ βιβλία τὰ ἅγια  tà biblía tà ágia  or  the holy scriptures   η αγία γραφή  e agía the bible was divided into chapters in the 13th  century by stephen langton and it was divided into verses in the 16th  century by french printer robert and is now usually cited by book  chapter  and verse  the division of the hebrew bible into verses is based on the sof passuk cantillation mark used by the 10th-century  masoretes to record the verse divisions used in earlier oral traditions the oldest extant copy of a complete bible is an early 4th-century  parchment book preserved in the vatican library  and it is known as the codex vaticanus  the oldest copy of the tanakh in hebrew and aramaic dates from the 10th  century ce  the oldest copy of a complete latin  vulgate  bible is the codex amiatinus  dating from the 8th  john k  riches  professor of divinity and biblical criticism at the university of glasgow  says that  the biblical texts themselves are the result of a creative dialogue between ancient traditions and different communities through the and  the biblical texts were produced over a period in which the living conditions of the writers – political  cultural  economic  and ecological – varied timothy h  lim  a professor of hebrew bible and second temple judaism at the university of edinburgh  says that the old testament is  a collection of authoritative texts of apparently divine origin that went through a human process of writing and he states that it is not a magical book  nor was it literally written by god and passed to mankind  parallel to the solidification of the hebrew canon  c  3rd  century bce   only the torah first and then the tanakh began to be translated into greek and expanded  now referred to as the septuagint or the greek old christian bibles  the new testament gospels were derived from oral traditions in the second half of the first century ce  riches says that scholars have attempted to reconstruct something of the history of the oral traditions behind the gospels  but the results have not been too encouraging  the period of transmission is short  less than 40  years passed between the death of jesus and the writing of mark s gospel  this means that there was little time for oral traditions to assume fixed bible was later translated into latin and other languages  john riches states that the translation of the bible into latin marks the beginning of a parting of the ways between western latin-speaking  christianity and eastern christianity  which spoke greek  syriac  coptic  ethiopic  and other languages  the bibles of the eastern churches vary considerably  the ethiopic orthodox canon includes 81  books and contains many apocalyptic texts  such as were found at qumran and subsequently excluded from the jewish canon  as a general rule  one can say that the orthodox churches generally follow the septuagint in including more books in their old testaments than are in the jewish masoretic text is the authoritative hebrew text of the hebrew bible  or tanakh  it defines the books of the jewish canon  and also the precise letter-text  of these biblical books  with their vocalization and accentuation the oldest extant manuscripts of the masoretic text date from approximately the 9th  century and the aleppo codex  once the oldest complete copy of the masoretic text  but now missing its torah section  dates from the 10th  century the name tanakh  hebrew  תנ ך‎  reflects the threefold division of the hebrew scriptures  torah   teaching    nevi im   prophets   and ketuvim   writings   the torah  תּוֹרָה  is also known as the  five books of moses  or the pentateuch  meaning  five hebrew names of the books are derived from the first words in the respective texts  the torah consists of the following five books the first eleven chapters of genesis provide accounts of the creation  or ordering  of the world and the history of god s early relationship with humanity  the remaining thirty-nine  chapters of genesis provide an account of god s covenant with the biblical patriarchs abraham  isaac and jacob  also called israel  and jacob s children  the  children of israel   especially joseph  it tells of how god commanded abraham to leave his family and home in the city of ur  eventually to settle in the land of canaan  and how the children of israel later moved to egypt  the remaining four books of the torah tell the story of moses  who lived hundreds of years after the patriarchs  he leads the children of israel from slavery in ancient egypt to the renewal of their covenant with god at mount sinai and their wanderings in the desert until a new generation was ready to enter the land of canaan  the torah ends with the death of torah contains the commandments of god  revealed at mount sinai  although there is some debate among traditional scholars as to whether these were all written down at one time  or over a period of time during the 40  years of the wanderings in the desert  while several modern jewish movements reject the idea of a literal revelation  and critical scholars believe that many of these laws developed later in jewish these commandments provide the basis for jewish religious law  tradition states that there are 613  commandments  taryag mitzvot  nevi im  hebrew  נְבִיאִים nəḇî îm‎‎   prophets   is the second main division of the tanakh  between the torah and ketuvim  it contains two sub-groups,  the former prophets  nevi im rishonim נביאים ראשונים  the narrative books of joshua  judges  samuel and kings  and the latter prophets  nevi im aharonim נביאים אחרונים  the books of isaiah  jeremiah and ezekiel and the twelve minor prophets  the nevi im tell the story of the rise of the hebrew monarchy and its division into two kingdoms  ancient israel and judah  focusing on conflicts between the israelites and other nations  and conflicts among israelites  specifically  struggles between believers in  the lord and believers in foreign and the criticism of unethical and unjust behaviour of israelite elites and in which prophets played a crucial and leading role  it ends with the conquest of the kingdom of israel by the assyrians followed by the conquest of the kingdom of judah by the babylonians and the destruction of the temple in jerusalem the former prophets are the books joshua  judges  samuel and kings  they contain narratives that begin immediately after the death of moses with the divine appointment of joshua as his successor  who then leads the people of israel into the promised land  and end with the release from imprisonment of the last king of judah  treating samuel and kings as single books  they cover the latter prophets are divided into two groups  the  major  prophets  isaiah  jeremiah  ezekiel  daniel  and the twelve minor prophets  collected into a single book  the collection is broken up to form twelve individual books in the christian old testament  one for each of the prophets ketuvim or kəṯûḇîm  in biblical hebrew  כְּתוּבִים‎‎  writings   is the third and final section of the tanakh  the ketuvim are believed to have been written under the ruach hakodesh  the holy spirit  but with one level less authority than that of masoretic manuscripts  and some printed editions   psalms  proverbs and job are presented in a special two-column  form emphasizing the parallel stichs in the verses  which are a function of their poetry  collectively  these three books are known as sifrei emet  an acronym of the titles in hebrew  איוב  משלי  תהלים yields emet אמ ת  which is also the hebrew for  truth   these three books are also the only ones in tanakh with a special system of cantillation notes that are designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses  however  the beginning and end of the book of job are in the normal prose system the five relatively short books of song of songs  book of ruth  the book of lamentations  ecclesiastes and book of esther are collectively known as the hamesh megillot  five megillot   these are the latest books collected and designated as  authoritative  in the jewish canon even though they were not complete until the 2nd  century the three poetic books and the five scrolls  the remaining books in ketuvim are daniel  ezra–nehemiah and chronicles  although there is no formal grouping for these books in the jewish tradition  they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics the following list presents the books of ketuvim in the order they appear in most printed editions  it also divides them into three subgroups based on the distinctiveness of sifrei emet and hamesh megillot the three poetic books  sifrei emet the five megillot  hamesh megillot other booksthe jewish textual tradition never finalized the order of the books in ketuvim  the babylonian talmud  bava batra 14b–15a)  gives their order as ruth  psalms  job  proverbs  ecclesiastes  song of solomon  lamentations of jeremiah  daniel  scroll of esther  ezra  tiberian masoretic codices  including the aleppo codex and the leningrad codex  and often in old spanish manuscripts as well  the order is chronicles  psalms  job  proverbs  ruth  song of solomon  ecclesiastes  lamentations of jeremiah  esther  daniel  ketuvim is the last of the three portions of the tanakh to have been accepted as biblical canon  while the torah may have been considered canon by israel as early as the 5th  century bce and the former and latter prophets were canonized by the 2nd  century bce  the ketuvim was not a fixed canon until the 2nd  century of the common suggests  however  that the people of israel were adding what would become the ketuvim to their holy literature shortly after the canonization of the prophets  as early as 132  bce references suggest that the ketuvim was starting to take shape  although it lacked a formal references in the four gospels as well as other books of the new testament indicate that many of these texts were both commonly known and counted as having some degree of religious authority early in the 1st  century ce many scholars believe that the limits of the ketuvim as canonized scripture were determined by the council of jamnia c  90  ce  against apion  the writing of josephus in 95  ce  treated the text of the hebrew bible as a closed canon to which      no one has ventured either to add  or to remove  or to alter a for a long time following this date the divine inspiration of esther  the song of songs  and ecclesiastes was often under tanakh was mainly written in biblical hebrew  with some small portions  ezra 4:8–6:18  and 7:12–26,  jeremiah 10:11,  daniel 2:4–7:28)  written in biblical aramaic  a sister language which became the lingua franca for much of the semitic septuagint  or the lxx  is a translation of the hebrew scriptures and some related texts into koine greek  begun in the late 3rd  century bce and completed by 132  initially in alexandria  but in time it was completed elsewhere as it is not altogether clear which was translated when  or where  some may even have been translated twice  into different versions  and then the work of translation progressed  the canon of the greek bible expanded  the torah always maintained its pre-eminence  as the basis of the canon but the collection of prophetic writings  based on the nevi im  had various hagiographical works incorporated into it  in addition  some newer books were included in the septuagint  among these are the maccabees and the wisdom of sirach  however  the book of sirach  is now known to have existed in a hebrew version  since ancient hebrew manuscripts of it were rediscovered in modern times  the septuagint version of some biblical books  like daniel and esther  are longer than those in the jewish some of these deuterocanonical books  e g  the wisdom of solomon  and the second book of maccabees  were not translated  but composed directly in needed since late antiquity  once attributed to a hypothetical late 1st-century  council of jamnia  mainstream rabbinic judaism rejected the septuagint as valid jewish scriptural texts  several reasons have been given for this  first  some mistranslations were claimed  second  the hebrew source texts used for the septuagint differed from the masoretic tradition of hebrew texts  which was chosen as canonical by the jewish third  the rabbis wanted to distinguish their tradition from the newly emerging tradition of finally  the rabbis claimed a divine authority for the hebrew language  in contrast to aramaic or greek – even though these languages were the lingua franca of jews during this period  and aramaic would eventually be given a holy language status comparable to septuagint is the basis for the old latin  slavonic  syriac  old armenian  old georgian and coptic versions of the christian old the roman catholic and eastern orthodox churches use most of the books of the septuagint  while protestant churches usually do not  after the protestant reformation  many protestant bibles began to follow the jewish canon and exclude the additional texts  which came to be called biblical apocrypha  the apocrypha are included under a separate heading in the king james version of the bible  the basis for the revised standard most ancient copies of the bible which contain the septuagint version of the old testament  the book of daniel is not the original septuagint version  but instead is a copy of theodotion s translation from the hebrew  which more closely resembles the masoretic needed  the septuagint version was discarded in favour of theodotion s version in the 2nd  to 3rd  centuries ce  in greek-speaking  areas  this happened near the end of the 2nd  century  and in latin-speaking  areas  at least in north africa   it occurred in the middle of the 3rd  century  history does not record the reason for this  and st  jerome reports  in the preface to the vulgate version of daniel   this thing  just  one of two old greek texts of the book of daniel has been recently rediscovered and work is ongoing in reconstructing the original form of the canonical ezra–nehemiah is known in the septuagint as  esdras b   and 1  esdras is  esdras a   1  esdras is a very similar text to the books of ezra–nehemiah  and the two are widely thought by scholars to be derived from the same original text  it has been proposed  and is thought highly likely by scholars  that  esdras b  – the canonical ezra–nehemiah – is theodotion s version of this material  and  esdras a  is the version which was previously in the septuagint on its texts are found in the septuagint but are not present in the hebrew  these additional books are tobit  judith  wisdom of solomon  wisdom of jesus son of sirach  baruch  the letter of jeremiah  which later became chapter 6  of baruch in the vulgate   additions to daniel  the prayer of azarias  the song of the three children  susanna and bel and the dragon   additions to esther  1  maccabees  2  maccabees  3  maccabees  4  maccabees  1  esdras  odes  including the prayer of manasseh  the psalms of solomon  and psalm 151.some  books that are set apart in the masoretic text are grouped together  for example  the books of samuel and the books of kings are in the lxx one book in four parts called βασιλειῶν   of reigns    in lxx  the books of chronicles supplement reigns and it is called paralipomenon  παραλειπομένων – things left out   the septuagint organizes the minor prophets as twelve parts of one book of christian bible is a set of books that a christian denomination regards as divinely inspired and thus constituting scripture  although the early church primarily used the septuagint or the targums among aramaic speakers  the apostles did not leave a defined set of new scriptures  instead the canon of the new testament developed over time  groups within christianity include differing books as part of their sacred writings  most prominent among which are the biblical apocrypha or deuterocanonical books significant versions of the english christian bible include the douay-rheims  bible  the authorized king james version  the english revised version  the american standard version  the revised standard version  the new american standard version  the new king james version  the new international version  and the english standard version the books which make up the christian old testament differ between the catholic  see catholic bible   orthodox  and protestant  see protestant bible  churches  with the protestant movement accepting only those books contained in the hebrew bible  while catholics and orthodox have wider canons  a few groups consider particular translations to be divinely inspired  notably the greek septuagint and the aramaic needed in eastern christianity  translations based on the septuagint still prevail  the septuagint was generally abandoned in favour of the 10th-century  masoretic text as the basis for translations of the old testament into western needed  some modern western translations since the 14th  century make use of the septuagint to clarify passages in the masoretic text  where the septuagint may preserve a variant reading of the hebrew needed  they also sometimes adopt variants that appear in other texts  e g   those discovered among the dead sea number of books which are part of the peshitta or the greek septuagint but are not found in the hebrew  rabbinic  bible  i e   among the protocanonical books  are often referred to as deuterocanonical books by roman catholics referring to a later secondary  i e   deutero  canon  that canon as fixed definitively by the council of trent it includes 46  books for the old testament (45  if jeremiah and lamentations are counted as one  and 27  for the protestants term these books as apocrypha  modern protestant traditions do not accept the deuterocanonical books as canonical  although protestant bibles included them in apocrypha sections until the 1820s.  however  roman catholic and eastern orthodox churches include these books as part of their old testament the roman catholic church addition to those  the greek and russian orthodox churches recognize the needed russian and georgian orthodox churches needed there is also 4  maccabees which is only accepted as canonical in the georgian church  but was included by st  jerome in an appendix to the vulgate  and is an appendix to the greek orthodox bible  and it is therefore sometimes included in collections of the needed the syriac orthodox tradition needed the ethiopian biblical canon needed and some other books the anglican church uses some of the apocryphal books liturgically  therefore  editions of the bible intended for use in the anglican church include the deuterocanonical books accepted by the catholic church  plus 1  esdras  2  esdras and the prayer of manasseh  which were in the vulgate needed the term pseudepigrapha commonly describes numerous works of jewish religious literature written from about 300  bce to 300  ce  not all of these works are actually pseudepigraphical  it also refers to books of the new testament canon whose authorship is misrepresented  the  old testament  pseudepigraphal works include the pseudepigraphal works include the books of enoch  such as 1  enoch  2  enoch  surviving only in old slavonic  and 3  enoch  surviving in hebrew  c  5th  to 6th  century ce   these are ancient jewish religious works  traditionally ascribed to the prophet enoch  the great-grandfather  of the patriarch noah  they are not part of the biblical canon used by jews  apart from beta israel  most christian denominations and traditions may accept the books of enoch as having some historical or theological interest or significance  it has been observed that part of the book of enoch is quoted in the epistle of jude  part of the new testament  but christian denominations generally regard the books of enoch as non-canonical  or however  the enoch books are treated as canonical by the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church and eritrean orthodox tewahedo church the older sections  mainly in the book of the watchers  are estimated to date from about 300  bc  and the latest part  book of parables  probably was composed at the end of the 1st  century arose in some protestant biblical scholarship an extended use of the term pseudepigrapha for works that appeared as though they ought to be part of the biblical canon  because of the authorship ascribed to them  but which stood outside both the biblical canons recognized by protestants and catholics  these works were also outside the particular set of books that roman catholics called deuterocanonical and to which protestants had generally applied the term apocryphal  accordingly  the term pseudepigraphical  as now used often among both protestants and roman catholics  allegedly for the clarity it brings to the discussion   may make it difficult to discuss questions of pseudepigraphical authorship of canonical books dispassionately with a lay audience  to confuse the matter even more  eastern orthodox christians accept books as canonical that roman catholics and most protestant denominations consider pseudepigraphical or at best of much less authority  there exist also churches that reject some of the books that roman catholics  orthodox and protestants accept  the same is true of some jewish sects  many works that are  apocryphal  are otherwise considered genuine the old testament has always been central to the life of the christian church  bible scholar n t  wright says  jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the he adds that the earliest christians also searched those same hebrew scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of jesus  they regarded the  holy writings  of the israelites as necessary and instructive for the christian  as seen from paul s words to timothy (2  timothy 3:15),  and as pointing to the messiah  and as having reached a climactic fulfillment in jesus himself  generating the  new covenant  prophesied by new testament is the name given to the second and final portion of the christian bible  jesus is its central figure the term  new testament  came into use in the second century during a controversy among christians over whether or not the hebrew bible should be included with the christian writings as sacred scripture  the new testament presupposes the inspiration of the old some other works which were widely read by early churches were excluded from the new testament and relegated to the collections known as the apostolic fathers  generally considered orthodox  and the new testament apocrypha  including both orthodox and heretical works   most christians consider the new testament to be an infallible source of doctrine  while others go even farther to affirm that it is also inerrant  or completely correct in historical and factual details as well as theologically  in recent times  however  the authority of the new testament books has been challenged  the school of historical criticism has exposed various apparent contradictions within the texts  as well as questions of authorship and dating the new testament is a collection of 27  of 4  different genres of christian literature  gospels  one account of the acts of the apostles  epistles and an apocalypse   these books can be grouped into the gospelsnarrative literature  account and history of the apostolic agepauline epistlespastoral epistlesgeneral epistles  also called catholic epistlesapocalyptic literature  also called propheticalthe new testament books are ordered differently in the catholic orthodox protestant tradition  the slavonic tradition  the syriac tradition and the ethiopian tradition the mainstream consensus is that the new testament was written in a form of koine which was the common language of the eastern from the conquests of alexander the great (335–323  bce  until the evolution of byzantine greek  c  600).the  original autographs  that is  the original greek writings and manuscripts written by the original authors of the new testament  have not but historically copies exist of those original autographs  transmitted and preserved in a number of manuscript traditions  there have been some minor variations  additions or omissions  in some of the texts  when ancient scribes copied earlier books  they sometimes wrote notes on the margins of the page  marginal glosses  to correct their text – especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line – and to comment about the text  when later scribes were copying the copy  they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text  over time  different regions evolved different versions  each with its own assemblage of omissions and three main textual traditions of the greek new testament are sometimes called the alexandrian text-type   generally minimalist   the byzantine text-type   generally maximalist   and the western text-type   occasionally wild   together they comprise most of the ancient manuscripts the old testament canon entered into christian use in the greek septuagint translations and original books  and their differing lists of texts  in addition to the septuagint  subsequently added various writings that would become the new testament  somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity  in the 4th  century a series of synods produced a list of texts equal to the 39,  46,  51,  or 54-book  canon of the old testament and to the 27-book  canon of the new testament that would be subsequently used to today  most notably the synod of hippo in 393  ce  also c  400,  jerome produced a definitive latin edition of the bible  see vulgate   the canon of which  at the insistence of the pope  was in accord with the earlier synods  with the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the new testament canon  although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time the protestant old testament of today has a 39-book  canon – the number of books  though not the content  varies from the jewish tanakh only because of a different method of division – while the roman catholic church recognizes 46  books (51  books with some books combined into 46  books  as the canonical old testament  the eastern orthodox churches recognize 3  maccabees  1  esdras  prayer of manasseh and psalm 151  in addition to the catholic canon  some include 2  esdras  the anglican church also recognizes a longer needed  the term  hebrew scriptures  is often used as being synonymous with the protestant old testament  since the surviving scriptures in hebrew include only those books  while catholics and orthodox include additional texts that have not survived in hebrew  both catholics and protestants  as well as greek orthodox  have the same 27-book  new testament new testament writers assumed the inspiration of the old testament  probably earliest stated in 2  timothy 3:16,   all scripture is given by inspiration of canon of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church is wider than the canons used by most other christian churches  there are 81  books in the ethiopian orthodox the ethiopian old testament canon includes the books found in the septuagint accepted by other orthodox christians  in addition to enoch and jubilees which are ancient jewish books that only survived in ge ez but are quoted in the new needed  also greek ezra first and the apocalypse of ezra  3  books of meqabyan  and psalm 151  at the end of the psalter  the three books of meqabyan are not to be confused with the books of maccabees  the order of the other books is somewhat different from other groups   as well  the old testament follows the septuagint order for the minor prophets rather than the jewish needed the second epistle to timothy says that  all scripture is given by inspiration of god  and is profitable for doctrine  for reproof  for correction  for instruction in righteousness   (2  timothy various related but distinguishable views on divine inspiration include within these broad beliefs many schools of hermeneutics operate   bible scholars claim that discussions about the bible must be put into its context within church history and then into the context of contemporary fundamentalist christians are whom   with the doctrine of biblical literalism  where the bible is not only inerrant  but the meaning of the text is clear to the average antiquity attests to belief in sacred and a similar belief emerges in the earliest of christian writings  various texts of the bible mention divine agency in relation to its in their book a general introduction to the bible  norman geisler and william nix write   the process of inspiration is a mystery of the providence of god  but the result of this process is a verbal  plenary  inerrant  and authoritative most evangelical biblical associate inspiration with only the original text  for example some american protestants adhere to the 1978  chicago statement on biblical inerrancy which asserted that inspiration applied only to the autographic text of among adherents of biblical literalism  a minority  such as followers of the king-james-only  movement  extend the claim of inerrancy only to a particular original texts of the tanakh were mainly in hebrew  with some portions in aramaic  in addition to the authoritative masoretic text  jews still refer to the septuagint  the translation of the hebrew bible into greek  and the targum onkelos  an aramaic version of the bible  there are several different ancient versions of the tanakh in hebrew  mostly differing by spelling  and the traditional jewish version is based on the version known as aleppo codex  even in this version there are words which are traditionally read differently from written  because the oral tradition is considered more fundamental than the written one  and presumably mistakes had been made in copying the text over the needed the primary biblical text for early christians was the septuagint  in addition  they translated the hebrew bible into several other languages  translations were made into syriac  coptic  ethiopic  and latin  among other languages  the latin translations were historically the most important for the church in the west  while the greek-speaking  east continued to use the septuagint translations of the old testament and had no need to translate the new testament the earliest latin translation was the old latin text  or vetus latina  which  from internal evidence  seems to have been made by several authors over a period of time  it was based on the septuagint  and thus included books not in the hebrew bible according to the latin decretum gelasianum  also known as the gelasian decree   thought to be of a 6th-century  of uncertain authorship and of pseudepigraphal papal authority  variously ascribed to pope gelasius i  pope damasus i  or pope but reflecting the views of the roman church by that the council of rome in 382  ad under pope damasus i (366–383)  assembled a list of books of the bible  damasus commissioned saint jerome to produce a reliable and consistent text by translating the original greek and hebrew texts into latin  this translation became known as the latin vulgate bible  in the fourth century ad  although jerome expressed in his prologues to most deuterocanonical books that they were in 1546,  at the council of trent  jerome s vulgate translation was declared by the roman catholic church to be the only authentic and official bible in the latin church since the protestant reformation  bible translations for many languages have been made  the bible continues to be translated to new languages  largely by christian organizations such as wycliffe bible translators  new tribes mission and bible societies john riches  professor of divinity and biblical criticism at the university of glasgow  provides the following view of the diverse historical influences of the bible it has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought  literature  and art  it has equally fuelled some of the worst excesses of human savagery  self-interest,  and narrow-mindedness.  it has inspired men and women to acts of great service and courage  to fight for liberation and human development  and it has provided the ideological
