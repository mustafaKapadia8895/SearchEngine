 rotational symmetry -  wikipediarotational symmetry  also known as radial symmetry in biology  is the property a shape has when it looks the same after some rotation by a partial turn  an object s degree of rotational symmetry is the number of distinct orientations in which it looks the same formally the rotational symmetry is symmetry with respect to some or all rotations in m-dimensional  euclidean space  rotations are direct isometries  i e   isometries preserving orientation  therefore a symmetry group of rotational symmetry is a subgroup of e  m   see euclidean group  symmetry with respect to all rotations about all points implies translational symmetry with respect to all translations  so space is homogeneous  and the symmetry group is the whole e m   with the modified notion of symmetry for vector fields the symmetry group can also be e  m  for symmetry with respect to rotations about a point we can take that point as origin  these rotations form the special orthogonal group so m   the group of m×m orthogonal matrices with determinant 1.  for m   3  this is the rotation group so(3).in  another meaning of the word  the rotation group of an object is the symmetry group within e  n   the group of direct isometries  in other words  the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of direct isometries  for chiral objects it is the same as the full symmetry group laws of physics are so(3)-invariant  if they do not distinguish different directions in space  because of noether s theorem  rotational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the angular momentum conservation law rotational symmetry of order n  also called n-fold  rotational symmetry  or discrete rotational symmetry of the nth order  with respect to a particular point  in 2d)  or axis  in 3d)  means that rotation by an angle of 360°/n  (180°,  120°,  90°,  72°,  60°,  51  3⁄7°,  etc   does not change the object  note that "1-fold"  symmetry is no symmetry  all objects look alike after a rotation of 360°).the  notation for n-fold  symmetry is cn or simply  n   the actual symmetry group is specified by the point or axis of symmetry  together with the n  for each point or axis of symmetry  the abstract group type is cyclic group of order n  zn  although for the latter also the notation cn is used  the geometric and abstract cn should be distinguished  there are other symmetry groups of the same abstract group type which are geometrically different  see cyclic symmetry groups in 3d.the  fundamental domain is a sector of 360°/n.examples  without additional reflection symmetry cn is the rotation group of a regular n-sided  polygon in 2d  and of a regular n-sided  pyramid in 3d.if  there is e g  rotational symmetry with respect to an angle of 100°,  then also with respect to one of 20°,  the greatest common divisor of 100°  and 360°.a  typical 3d  object with rotational symmetry  possibly also with perpendicular axes  but no mirror symmetry is a propeller for discrete symmetry with multiple symmetry axes through the same point  there are the following possibilities in the case of the platonic solids  the 2-fold  axes are through the midpoints of opposite edges  and the number of them is half the number of edges  the other axes are through opposite vertices and through centers of opposite faces  except in the case of the tetrahedron  where the 3-fold  axes are each through one vertex and the center of one face rotational symmetry with respect to any angle is  in two dimensions  circular symmetry  the fundamental domain is a half-line.in  three dimensions we can distinguish cylindrical symmetry and spherical symmetry  no change when rotating about one axis  or for any rotation   that is  no dependence on the angle using cylindrical coordinates and no dependence on either angle using spherical coordinates  the fundamental domain is a half-plane  through the axis  and a radial half-line,  respectively  axisymmetric or axisymmetrical are adjectives which refer to an object having cylindrical symmetry  or axisymmetry  an example of approximate spherical symmetry is the earth  with respect to density and other physical and chemical properties  in 4d,  continuous or discrete rotational symmetry about a plane corresponds to corresponding 2d  rotational symmetry in every perpendicular plane  about the point of intersection  an object can also have rotational symmetry about two perpendicular planes  e g  if it is the cartesian product of two rotationally symmetry 2d  figures  as in the case of e g  the duocylinder and various regular duoprisms.2-fold  rotational symmetry together with single translational symmetry is one of the frieze groups  there are two rotocenters per primitive cell together with double translational symmetry the rotation groups are the following wallpaper groups  with axes per primitive cell scaling of a lattice divides the number of points per unit area by the square of the scale factor  therefore the number of 2-,  3-,  4-,  and 6-fold  rotocenters per primitive cell is 4,  3,  2,  and 1,  respectively  again including 4-fold  as a special case of 2-fold,  etc.3-fold  rotational symmetry at one point and 2-fold  at another one  or ditto in 3d  with respect to parallel axes  implies rotation group p6,  i e  double translational symmetry and 6-fold  rotational symmetry at some point  or  in 3d,  parallel axis   the translation distance for the symmetry generated by one such pair of rotocenters is 2√3  times their distance
