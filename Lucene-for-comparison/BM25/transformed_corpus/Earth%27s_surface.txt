expansion of the air  this lower-density  air then rises and is replaced by cooler  higher-density  air  the result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30°  latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes  between 30°  and ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate  particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere  when atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm  humid air  this water condenses and falls to the surface as most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes  this water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods  precipitation patterns vary widely  ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter  atmospheric circulation  topographic features  and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each amount of solar energy reaching earth s surface decreases with increasing latitude

the kármán line  defined as 100  km above earth s surface  is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from earth s gravity  this causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space  because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass  it can achieve escape velocity more readily  and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other the leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of earth s atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one  photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen  but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on

perpendicular to the earth–sun plane  the ecliptic   and the earth–moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1  degrees against the earth–sun plane  without this tilt  there would be an eclipse every two weeks  alternating between lunar eclipses and solar hill sphere  or the sphere of gravitational influence  of the earth is about 1.5  million kilometres (930,000  mi  in 19]  this is the maximum distance at which the earth s gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant sun and planets  objects must orbit the earth within this radius  or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the sun earth  along with the solar system  is situated in the milky way and orbits about 28,000  light-years  from its center  it is about 20  light-years  above the galactic plane in the orion axial tilt of the earth is approximately with the axis of its orbit plane  always pointing towards the celestial poles  due to earth s axial tilt  the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year  this causes the seasonal change in climate  with summer in the northern hemisphere occurring when the tropic of cancer is facing the sun  and winter taking place when the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere faces the sun  during the summer  the day lasts longer  and the sun climbs higher in the sky  in winter  the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter  in northern temperate latitudes  the sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice  and sets north of true west  reversing in the winter  the sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west above the arctic circle  an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year  up to six months at the north pole itself  a polar night  in the southern hemisphere  the situation is exactly reversed  with the south pole oriented opposite the direction of the north pole  six months later  this pole will experience a midnight sun  a day of 24  hours  again reversing with the south pole by astronomical convention  the four seasons can be determined by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the sun—and the equinoxes  when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the sun are perpendicular  in the northern hemisphere  winter solstice currently occurs around 21  december  summer solstice is near 21  june  spring equinox is around 20  march and autumnal equinox is about 22  or 23  september  in the southern hemisphere  the situation is reversed  with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates angle of earth s axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time  its axial tilt does undergo nutation  a slight  irregular motion with a main period of 18.6  the orientation  rather than the angle  of earth s axis also changes over time  precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800  year cycle  this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year  both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the sun and the moon on earth s equatorial bulge  the poles also migrate a few meters across earth s surface  this polar motion has multiple  cyclical components  which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion  in addition to an annual component to this motion  there is a 14-month  cycle called the chandler wobble  earth s rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day  modern times  earth s perihelion occurs around 3  january  and its aphelion around 4  july  these dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors  which follow cyclical patterns known as milankovitch cycles  the changing earth–sun distance causes an increase of about 20]  in solar energy reaching earth at perihelion relative to aphelion  because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun at about the same time that earth reaches the closest approach to the sun  the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the sun than does the northern over the course of a year  this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt  and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern study from 2016  suggested that planet nine tilted all solar system planets  including earth s by about 6  planet that can sustain life is termed habitable  even if life did not originate there  earth provides

mission in moon is a relatively large  terrestrial  planet-like  natural satellite  with a diameter about one-quarter  of earth s  it is the largest moon in the solar system relative to the size of its planet  although charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet pluto  the natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as  moons   after earth s the gravitational attraction between earth and the moon causes tides on earth  the same effect on the moon has led to its tidal locking  its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit earth  as a result  it always presents the same face to the planet  as the moon orbits earth  different parts of its face are illuminated by the sun  leading to the lunar phases  the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator due to their tidal interaction  the moon recedes from earth at the rate of approximately 38  mm yr  over millions of years  these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of earth s day by about 23  µs yr—add up to significant during the devonian period  for example   approximately 7002410000000000000♠410  mya  there were 400  days in a year  with each day lasting 21.8  moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet s climate  paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that earth s axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the sun and planets to earth s equatorial bulge  the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable  exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years  as appears to be the case for from earth  the moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized  disk as the sun  the angular size  or solid angle  of these two bodies match because  although the sun s diameter is about 400  times as large as the moon s  it is also 400  times more this allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on earth the most widely accepted theory of the moon s origin  the giant-impact  hypothesis  states that it formed from the collision of a mars-size  protoplanet called theia with the early earth  this hypothesis explains  among other things  the moon s relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of earth s has at

of the world human cultures have developed many views of the planet  earth is sometimes personified as a deity  in many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility and by the mid-20th  century  the gaia principle compared earth s environments and life as a single self-regulating  organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of creation myths in many religions involve the creation of earth by a supernatural deity or investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people s view of the planet  in the west  belief in a flat was displaced by the idea of spherical earth  credited to pythagoras in the 6th  century earth was further believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th  century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object  comparable to the other planets in the solar due to the efforts of influential christian scholars and clerics such as james ussher  who sought to determine the age of earth through analysis of genealogies in scripture  westerners before the 19th  century generally believed earth to be a few thousand years old at most  it was only during the 19th  century that geologists realized earth s age was at least many millions of kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of earth to be between 20  million and 400  million years in 1864,  sparking a vigorous debate on the subject  it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th  and early 20th  centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining earth s age was established  proving the planet to be billions of years the perception of earth shifted again in the 20th  century when humans first viewed it from orbit  and especially with photographs of earth
