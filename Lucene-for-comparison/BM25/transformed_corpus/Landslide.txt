 landslide -  wikipediaa landslide  also known as a landslip needed  is a form of mass wasting that includes a wide range of ground movements  such as rockfalls  deep failure of slopes  and shallow debris flows  landslides can occur underwater  called a submarine landslide  coastal and onshore environments  although the action of gravity is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur  there are other contributing factors affecting the original slope stability  typically  pre-conditional  factors build up specific sub-surface  conditions that make the slope area prone to failure  whereas the actual landslide often requires a trigger before being released  landslides should not be confused with mudflows  a form of mass wasting involving very to extremely rapid flow of debris that has become partially or fully liquefied by the addition of significant amounts of water to the source material landslides occur when the slope changes from a stable to an unstable condition  a change in the stability of a slope can be caused by a number of factors  acting together or alone  natural causes of landslides include landslides are aggravated by human activities  such asslope material that becomes saturated with water may develop into a debris flow or mud flow  the resulting slurry of rock and mud may pick up trees  houses and cars  thus blocking bridges and tributaries causing flooding along its path debris flow is often mistaken for flash flood  but they are entirely different processes.muddy-debris  flows in alpine areas cause severe damage to structures and infrastructure and often claim human lives  muddy-debris  flows can start as a result of slope-related  factors and shallow landslides can dam stream beds  resulting in temporary water blockage  as the impoundments fail  a  domino effect  may be created  with a remarkable growth in the volume of the flowing mass  which takes up the debris in the stream channel  the solidâ€“liquid mixture can reach densities of up to 2,000  kg/m3  (120  lb cu ft  and velocities of up to 14  m s (46  ft s  these processes normally cause the first severe road interruptions  due not only to deposits accumulated on the road  from several cubic metres to hundreds of cubic metres   but in some cases to the complete removal of bridges or roadways or railways crossing the stream channel  damage usually derives from a common underestimation of mud-debris  flows  in the alpine valleys  for example  bridges are frequently destroyed by the impact force of the flow because their span is usually calculated only for a water discharge  for a small basin in the italian alps  area 1.76  km2  (0.68  sq mi   affected by a debris estimated a peak discharge of 750  m3/s  (26,000  cu ft s  for a section located in the middle stretch of the main channel  at the same cross section  the maximum foreseeable water discharge  by hec-1),  was 19  m3/s  (670  cu ft s   a value about 40  times lower than that calculated for the debris flow that occurred earthflows are downslope  viscous flows of saturated  fine-grained  materials  which move at any speed from slow to fast  typically  they can move at speeds from 0.17  to 20  km h (0.1  to 12.4  mph   though these are a lot like mudflows  overall they are more slow moving and are covered with solid material carried along by flow from within  they are different from fluid flows which are more rapid  clay  fine sand and silt  and fine-grained,  pyroclastic material are all susceptible to earthflows  the velocity of the earthflow is all dependent on how much water content is in the flow itself  the higher the water content in the flow  the higher the velocity will be these flows usually begin when the pore pressures in a fine-grained  mass increase until enough of the weight of the material is supported by pore water to significantly decrease the internal shearing strength of the material  this thereby creates a bulging lobe which advances with a slow  rolling motion  as these lobes spread out  drainage of the mass increases and the margins dry out  thereby lowering the overall velocity of the flow  this process causes the flow to thicken  the bulbous variety of earthflows are not that spectacular  but they are much more common than their rapid counterparts  they develop a sag at their heads and are usually derived from the slumping at the source earthflows occur much more during periods of high precipitation  which saturates the ground and adds water to the slope content  fissures develop during the movement of clay-like  material which creates the intrusion of water into the earthflows  water then increases the pore-water  pressure and reduces the shearing strength of the debris slide is a type of slide characterized by the chaotic movement of rocks  soil  and debris mixed with water and or ice  they are usually triggered by the saturation of thickly vegetated slopes which results in an incoherent mixture of broken timber  smaller vegetation and other debris avalanches differ from debris slides because their movement is much more rapid  this is usually a result of lower cohesion or higher water content and commonly steeper slopes steep coastal cliffs can be caused by catastrophic debris avalanches  these have been common on the submerged flanks of ocean island volcanos such as the hawaiian islands and the cape verde another slip of this type was storegga landslide debris slides generally start with big rocks that start at the top of the slide and begin to break apart as they slide towards the bottom  this is much slower than a debris avalanche  debris avalanches are very fast and the entire mass seems to liquefy as it slides down the slope  this is caused by a combination of saturated material  and steep slopes  as the debris moves down the slope it generally follows stream channels leaving a v-shaped  scar as it moves down the hill  this differs from the more u-shaped  scar of a slump  debris avalanches can also travel well past the foot of the slope due to their tremendous sturzstrom is a rare  poorly understood type of landslide  typically with a long run-out.  often very large  these slides are unusually mobile  flowing very far over a low angle  flat  or even slightly uphill terrain landslide in which the sliding surface is located within the soil mantle or weathered bedrock  typically to a depth from few decimetres to some metres is called a shallow landslide  they usually include debris slides  debris flow  and failures of road cut-slopes.  landslides occurring as single large blocks of rock moving slowly down slope are sometimes called block glides shallow landslides can often happen in areas that have slopes with high permeable soils on top of low permeable bottom soils  the low permeable  bottom soils trap the water in the shallower  high permeable soils creating high water pressure in the top soils  as the top soils are filled with water and become heavy  slopes can become very unstable and slide over the low permeable bottom soils  say there is a slope with silt and sand as its top soil and bedrock as its bottom soil  during an intense rainstorm  the bedrock will keep the rain trapped in the top soils of silt and sand  as the topsoil becomes saturated and heavy  it can start to slide over the bedrock and become a shallow landslide  r  h  campbell did a study on shallow landslides on santa cruz island  california  he notes that if permeability decreases with depth  a perched water table may develop in soils at intense precipitation  when pore water pressures are sufficient to reduce effective normal stress to a critical level  failure in which the sliding surface is mostly deeply located below the maximum rooting depth of trees  typically to depths greater than ten meters   deep-seated  landslides usually involve deep regolith  weathered rock  and or bedrock and include large slope failure associated with translational  rotational  or complex movement  this type of landslide potentially occurs in an tectonic active region like zagros mountain in iran  these typically move slowly  only several meters per year  but occasionally move faster  they tend to be larger than shallow landslides and form along a plane of weakness such as a fault or bedding plane  they can be visually identified by concave scarps at the top and steep areas at the that occur undersea  or have impact into water e g  significant rockfall or volcanic collapse into the can generate tsunamis  massive landslides can also generate megatsunamis  which are usually hundreds of meters high  in 1958,  one such tsunami occurred in lituya bay in hazard analysis and mapping can provide useful information for catastrophic loss reduction  and assist in the development of guidelines for sustainable land use planning  the analysis is used to identify the factors that are related to landslides  estimate the relative contribution of factors causing slope failures  establish a relation between the factors and landslides  and to predict the landslide hazard in the future based on such a the factors that have been used for landslide hazard analysis can usually be grouped into geomorphology  geology  land use land cover  and hydrogeology  since many factors are considered for landslide hazard mapping  gis is an appropriate tool because it has functions of collection  storage  manipulation  display  and analysis of large amounts of spatially referenced data which can be handled fast and cardenas reported evidence on the exhaustive use of gis in conjunction of uncertainty modelling tools for landslide remote sensing techniques are also highly employed for landslide hazard assessment and analysis  before and after aerial photographs and satellite imagery are used to gather landslide characteristics  like distribution and classification  and factors like slope  lithology  and land use land cover to be used to help predict future before and after imagery also helps to reveal how the landscape changed after an event  what may have triggered the landslide  and shows the process of regeneration and satellite imagery in combination with gis and on-the-ground  studies  it is possible to generate maps of likely occurrences of future such maps should show the locations of previous events as well as clearly indicate the probable locations of future events  in general  to predict landslides  one must assume that their occurrence is determined by certain geologic factors  and that future landslides will occur under the same conditions as past therefore  it is necessary to establish a relationship between the geomorphologic conditions in which the past events took place and the expected future disasters are a dramatic example of people living in conflict with the environment  early predictions and warnings are essential for the reduction of property damage and loss of life  because landslides occur frequently and can represent some of the most destructive forces on earth  it is imperative to have a good understanding as to what causes them and how people can either help prevent them from occurring or simply avoid them when they do occur  sustainable land management and development is also an essential key to reducing the negative impacts felt by landslides gis offers a superior method for landslide analysis because it allows one to capture  store  manipulate  analyze  and display large amounts of data quickly and effectively  because so many variables are involved  it is important to be able to overlay the many layers of data to develop a full and accurate portrayal of what is taking place on the earth s surface  researchers need to know which variables are the most important factors that trigger landslides in any given location  using gis  extremely detailed maps can be generated to show past events and likely future events which have the potential to save

landslides has been detected on many bodies in the solar system  but since most observations are made by probes that only observe for a limited time and most bodies in the solar system appear to be geologically inactive not many landslides are known to have happened in recent times  both venus and mars have been subject to long-term  mapping by orbiting satellites  and examples of landslides have been observed on both planets
