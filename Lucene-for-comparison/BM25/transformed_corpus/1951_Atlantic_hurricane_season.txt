 1951  atlantic hurricane season -  wikipediathe 1951  atlantic hurricane season was the first hurricane season in which tropical cyclones were officially named by the united states weather the season officially started on june 15,  when the united states weather bureau began its daily monitoring for tropical cyclone the season officially ended on november it was the first year since 1937  in which no hurricanes made landfall on the united as hurricane how was the only tropical storm to hit the nation  the season had the least tropical cyclone damage in the united states since the 1939  as in the 1950  season  names from the joint army navy phonetic alphabet were used to name storms this first hurricane of the season  able  formed prior to the official start of the season  before reanalysis in 2015,  it was once listed as the earliest major hurricane on record in the atlantic basin  it formed on may 16  and executed a counterclockwise loop over the bahamas  later it brushed the north carolina coastline  hurricane charlie was a powerful category 4  hurricane that struck jamaica as a major hurricane  killing hundreds and becoming the worst disaster in over 50  years  the hurricane later struck mexico twice as a major hurricane  producing deadly flooding outside of tampico  tamaulipas  the strongest hurricane  easy  spent its duration over the open atlantic ocean  briefly threatening bermuda  and was formerly listed as one of a relatively few category 5  hurricanes on record over the atlantic ocean  it briefly neared category 5  status and interacted with hurricane fox  marking the first known instance of a hurricane affecting another s path as the calendar entered the new year  cyclogenesis occurred with a non-tropical  frontal wave over the western north atlantic ocean due to a closed low forming in a mid-level  trough  which eventually produced a low-pressure  center at the surface by january 2.  ships recorded moderate gales up to 60  miles per hour (97  km h  in connection with the new surface low  which formed several hundred miles east-southeast  of while initially lacking tropical attributes  the cyclone headed southeast for two days before curving as it did so  the temperature of the system warmed in its lower levels  causing the cyclone to evolve into a more barotropic system  late on january 4,  the system shrunk in size and began developing an inner core  reanalysis determined that the system became a tropical storm at this time  though it would have likely been considered subtropical beginning in the early origins of the first hurricane of the season were from a trough that exited the east coast of the united states on may 12.  a low-pressure  area developed on may 14,  and two days later it developed into a tropical cyclone about 300  miles (480  km  south of bermuda  it formed beneath an upper-level  low  and initially was not fully tropical  the depression followed the low  initially toward the northwest and later the southwest  moving over the gulf stream  the depression intensified into tropical storm able on may the storm turned to the south  and hurricane hunters reported that able strengthened to hurricane status on may 17  off the coast of outer rainbands of able produced light rainfall and high seas along the florida it later moved through the northern bahamas early on may 18,  where it produced hurricane-force  winds of 85  mph (137  the hurricane later turned to the north  gradually strengthening through may 21.  shortly thereafter  able passed about 70  miles (110  km  east of cape hatteras before turning east and reaching its peak of 90  mph (145  km h  early on may along the coast  the hurricane produced high tides but little able maintained hurricane intensity for two more days before weakening to a tropical storm early on may able rapidly dissipated that same day  though originally it was assessed as having transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on may 2015,  able was listed as having peak winds of 115  mph (185  km h  and was analyzed to have been the earliest major hurricane on record  such a storm would be a category 3  or greater on the saffir-simpson  hurricane scale  a system developed and introduced in the able was also the strongest hurricane outside of the current hurricane season  june 1  through november however  reanalysis by scientists in 2015  determined that able was in fact far weaker than originally listed in hurdat  the official database containing information on storm tracks and intensities in the atlantic and eastern north pacific regions  it also lost its distinction as the strongest preseason cyclone on record  the record being held by a category 2  hurricane in march the hurricane was one of four north atlantic hurricanes on record to exist during the month of may  the others occurring in 1889,  1908,  and august 2,  an easterly wave spawned a tropical depression about 680  miles (1095  km  northeast of barbuda in the lesser antilles  it moved northwestward  quickly strengthening into tropical storm baker  early on august 3,  the storm attained peak winds of 60  mph (97  km h   and the next day passed about 275  mi (443  km  east of at its peak intensity  the gale force winds extended 100  miles (160  km  to the north of the after attaining its peak  baker quickly weakened on august 4  and turned to the early the next day  it regained some of its former strength  peaking again at 50  mph (80  km h  before losing its identity  it never affected third tropical cyclone of the season developed on august 12  from a tropical wave  930  miles (1,495  km  east-southeast  of barbados  after a few days without further development  the system intensified into tropical storm charlie on august 14,  and subsequently crossed through the lesser antilles a day later with winds of 70  mph (113  shortly after entering the caribbean sea  the storm intensified to hurricane status early on august 16.  passing south of puerto rico and hispaniola  charlie then underwent rapid deepening beginning late that day  its winds increasing 35  mph (56  km h  in 24  as it neared the island of jamaica early on august 18,  charlie became a major hurricane and shortly afterward struck just south of kingston with winds of 125  mph (201  km h —equivalent to a strong category 3  hurricane on the saffir-simpson  hurricane wind scale  making charlie  along with hurricane gilbert in 1988,  the strongest ever to hit the on the island  the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall up to 17  in (430  mm   the combination of strong winds and the rains left around $50  million (1951  usd  $380  million 2005  usd  in crop and property damage  across the country there were 152  deaths  2,000  injuries  and 25,000  people left homeless  as a result  it was considered the worst disaster in the country in the 20th  century until hurricane gilbert produced even costlier damage  though with fewer reported making landfall  charlie weakened in its passage over the mountainous center of jamaica  and by the time it left the island  its winds had diminished to 85  mph (137  charlie later passed south of the cayman islands  with grand cayman reporting peak wind gusts of 92  mph (148  as it did so  the storm began to undergo yet another period of rapid intensification beginning on august 19.  it re-attained  major hurricane status late that day  and early on august 20  charlie peaked at 130  mph (209  km h   equivalent to low-end  category 4  maintaining its strength  the hurricane then made landfall on the southern tip of cozumel and hit the mexican mainland near akumal on the yucatán peninsula  the strong winds destroyed 70%  of the crops along its path  although no deaths were reported in the yucatán several homes were wrecked in the as it moved inland  charlie weakened rapidly over land  reaching the bay of campeche as a minimal hurricane early on august once over water  it failed to re-intensify  for a full day  but began doing so early on august 22.  as it did so  it rapidly re-intensified  for a third and final time  reaching peak winds of 115  mph (185  km h  before striking near the city of miramar  just north of it dissipated on august 23.  the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall in the region  flooding rivers and causing dams to burst  hundreds of people were killed in the mexican mainland  and across charlie s entire path  damage was estimated at over $75  million (1951  usd  $692  million 2017  the outer fringes of the storm increased surf along the texas tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on august 27  southwest of cape verde it moved westward  eventually intensifying into a tropical storm early on august the next day  the storm was first observed by hurricane hunters  several hundred miles east of barbados  and it was named by that time  its winds were around 60  mph (97  km h   and the storm continued intensifying as it approached the lesser on september 2,  dog attained hurricane reaching its peak of 90  mph (145  km h  as it passed between the islands of saint lucia and the storm  then quite small in diameter  produced strong wind gusts of up to 115  mph (185  km h  at the airport in fort-de-france  on however  this peak was short-lived,  for upon entering the eastern caribbean sea dog began a slow but steady weakening trend  on september 4,  dog weakened to tropical storm status to the south of hispaniola  and the next day dissipated in the western northern saint lucia  the combination of flooding and high winds destroyed 70%  of the banana crop  two sailing vessels were destroyed  and another one damaged  across the island  hurricane dog killed two people from damage was heavier on martinique  located on the north side of the storm  the hurricane s winds destroyed 1,000  homes and the roofs of several others  downed trees blocked roads and disrupted power lines  the winds also destroyed 90%  of the banana crop and 30%  of the sugar cane  throughout martinique  dog left $3  million in damage (1951  usd  $27.7  million 2017  usd  and killed five people from it was considered the  most violent storm  in martinique in 20  initially the hurricane was expected to strike jamaica  prompting hurricane warnings for the country  as well as along the southern coast of jamaica was earlier struck by hurricane charlie a few weeks prior  and the threat from dog prompted coastal evacuations and the closure of an ultimately  dog dissipated and produced only light rainfall on the easy  the strongest tropical cyclone of the season  was a powerful and long-lived  cape verde-type  hurricane that originated as a tropical depression on september 1  between the lesser antilles and cape moving generally west-northwestward,  the depression deepened into a tropical storm late that day  and further to hurricane status by september 3.  on september 5,  the cyclone reached its first peak of 110  mph (177  km h   but failed to continue strengthening  its winds fluctuated through the early morning on september 6,  but then resumed strengthening  reaching major hurricane status by that during this period  hurricane hunters flew into the hurricane to monitor its progress  recording a minimum pressure of 957  millibars (28.26  inhg  on september 6  to the north of the lesser the next day  as the storm continued strengthening  an aircraft was unable to penetrate the center  estimating winds of 160  mph (257  km h  south of the eye  on this basis  easy was once classified as a category 5  hurricane on the saffir-simpson  early estimates of the winds by reconnaissance aircraft were often based on visual cues  such as the state of the sea surface  and were thus subjective and often subsequent reanalysis in 2015  lowered its peak winds to 150  mph (240  km h  on september 8.  this was based on the hurricane hunters reporting a pressure of 937  mb (27.67  inhg  on the previous day  and a ship reporting winds of 140  mph (220  by the time easy attained peak intensity  it had turned to the north and northeast while beginning a steady weakening it interacted with the small hurricane fox to the east  this was the first observed instance of a hurricane affecting another s easy then turned to the northeast  passing a short distance southeast of bermuda on september 9  with winds of 110  mph (177  easy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on september 11,  while still maintaining hurricane-force  winds  the remnants lost their hurricane-force  winds on september 12,  only to briefly regain them two days later  on september 14,  easy lost its identity over the northern atlantic ocean after it was absorbed by another extratropical storm to the weather bureau advised the island to take precautionary measures in advance of the tourists and residents  worked feverishly  to complete preparations  and the united states air force issued  a formal warning at numerous hotels and homes were shuttered  heavy traffic snarled evacuations  and 100  tourists were stranded on the island without  roundtrip reservations   air force aircraft returned to the united states  and personnel secured various facilities at the island s on bermuda  the hurricane produced winds of only 50  mph (80  km h   which downed a few banana in addition to affecting bermuda  the strong winds of the hurricane damaged a few ships along its the same time as easy was forming  a new tropical depression developed in the far eastern atlantic ocean  moving generally westward  it passed south of the cape verde islands  quickly strengthening into tropical storm fox early on september 3;  by that time  its motion turned to the on september 5,  fox attained hurricane status  around the same time as it was first observed by ships  two days later  hurricane hunters reported peak winds of 115  mph (185  km h   making it a major hurricane  albeit one of very small around that time  fox interacted with hurricane easy to its northwest  after maintaining peak winds for 12  hours  fox began a steady weakening trend  accelerating to the north and northeast ahead of easy and passing to the east of bermuda  on september 10,  fox  while still of hurricane force  became extratropical between the azores and greenland in the far north atlantic  it turned toward the north and dissipated on september 11  off the southwest coast of iceland  although a few ships were affected by the hurricane s winds  there were no reports of any storm george developed in the bay of campeche on september 19.  moving west-northwestward,  it quickly attained peak winds of 60  mph (97  km h  late on the next day  as reported by the hurricane george later made landfall on september 21  in mexico about 55  mi (90  km  south of tampico as a moderate tropical before it moved ashore  the storm spread rainfall along the coast and increased waves  causing one drowning george quickly dissipated upon making landfall  and there were no reports of easterly wave spawned a tropical depression in the western caribbean sea on september 29.  it moved north-northwestward  for a few days before turning eastward in the central gulf of based on hurricane hunter reports  the depression intensified into tropical storm how late on september 30,  and it continued to strengthen as it approached southwest florida  on october 2,  how attained its first peak of 65  mph (105  km h  just before making landfall near boca grande  and within the day it crossed southern at the time  the storm was not well organized  and its strongest winds were confined to squalls in the florida keys and the southeast wind damage was minor  although heavy rainfall was peaking at 15.7  inches (40  cm  near where it moved the precipitation caused significant street flooding  while about 7,000  acres (28  km2)  of tomato and bean fields were storm emerged into the atlantic ocean between fort pierce and vero beach  quickly intensifying to hurricane strength by october 3.  turning northeastward  how reached its second and strongest peak of 100  mph (161  km h  on october 4  as it passed near the outer banks of north along the coast  the hurricane produced high tides and minor subsequently  the hurricane briefly weakened  only to recover its peak of 100  mph (161  km h  on october it passed southeast of cape cod before turning more to the causing road closures due to high offshore  the hurricane sank a ship  killing 17  while still of hurricane force  how became an extratropical storm on october 6,  and a few days later it curved to the northeast  the extratropical cyclone later struck iceland near hvolsvöllur with winds of 75  mph (121  km h  on october a couple of days later  the remnants of how dissipated in the far northern overall  hurricane how caused about $2  million (1951  usd  $18.5  million 2017  usd  in tropical depression formed southwest of jamaica on october 12.  a small system  it moved northwestward and intensified into tropical storm item on october 13.  it turned toward the north  and the next day attained peak winds of 65  mph (105  km h  after moving through the cayman islands  concurrently  the hurricane hunters observed peak winds of 80  mph (129  km h   and on this basis  item was operationally upgraded to a minimal hurricane  although it retained this status in hurdat for years  subsequent reanalysis in 2015  found the reconnaissance estimates to have been too item maintained its peak for more than a day before weakening  it lost tropical storm status on october 16  as it drifted to the northwest  continuing a slow weakening trend  it passed just east of the isla de la juventud before striking western cuba as a tropical depression on october 17.  later that day it dissipated in the southeastern gulf of threat of the hurricane prompted precautions to be made in portions of cuba  additionally  storm warnings were posted in the florida keys  southern mainland florida  as well as the however  no damage was of the last tropical cyclones of the season formed on october 15  just northeast of the bahamas  although listed as a tropical storm  it would have likely been classified as a subtropical cyclone beginning in the 1970s,  but was unable to be classified as such given the lack of satellite imagery to prove its status  given the name  jig   it moved northeastward  quickly attaining hurricane status with winds of 75  mph (121  km h   which it maintained for a full on october 16,  jig began a slow weakening trend  weakening below hurricane force and turning sharply northeastward  during this time  the storm made its closest approach to the southeastern united states while passing well southeast of cape while offshore  the storm increased surf along the north carolina and virginia coastlines  prompting storm early october 18,  jig became extratropical with winds of 70  mph (113  km h  and began a counterclockwise loop over the western atlantic  the next day it turned to the southeast before dissipating about 230  mi (370  km  south of bermuda on october early december  a cold front passed north of bermuda  a disturbance along the front began rotating on december 2,  developing into a small but powerful extratropical storm on the next day  by late on december 3,  the storm attained hurricane-force  winds  and it increasingly became the dominant system within the broad frontal region  a ridge to the east turned this storm to the southwest  the winds diminished below hurricane-intensity  on december 5,  and concurrently the inner structure became more tropical as the frontal features dissipated  during this time  ships in the region reported strong winds  mostly to the north  increasing water temperatures fueled atmospheric instability  likely causing an increase in convection  and the system was potentially a subtropical cyclone on december 6,  while located about 1,015  mi (1,635  km  east-northeast  of bermuda  a nearby ship recorded a minimum pressure of 987  mbar (29.1  inhg  around that time  after the storm turned to the southeast  a ship in the region reported winds of 75  mph (120  km h  near the center and a pressure of 995  mbar (29.4  inhg   while a weather station indicated that the system had a warm core  the data suggested that the system became a fully tropical hurricane by 12:00  utc on december 7,  and that it likely had transitioned into a tropical storm six hours earlier  by 18:00  utc that night  the hurricane attained peak winds of 80  mph (130  december 8,  the hurricane turned to the east and weakened into a tropical storm  steered by an approaching trough  over the next day  the storm accelerated to the east-northeast  toward the azores  late on december 10,  the storm moved through the azores as a tropical storm  although it was transitioning back into an extratropical storm at the time  by 06:00  utc on december 11,  the system was extratropical again after it rejoined with a nearby cold front  it likely merged with another nontropical storm to its east on december 12,  although it is possible the former hurricane remained a distinct system  a building ridge near spain forced the extratropical system to the southeast  eventually dissipating after moving ashore morocco on december names were used to name storms during the 1951  atlantic hurricane season  as this season had the same names and was less active than 1950,  none of these names were used for the first time  names that were not assigned are marked in
