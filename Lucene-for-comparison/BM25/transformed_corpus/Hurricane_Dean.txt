pressure  only behind cyclone george in the australian region  and tied with felix as the most intense worldwide in terms of 1-minute  sustained winds the hurricane s intense winds  waves  rains and storm surge were responsible for at least 45  deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of us$1.66  billion  first impacting the islands of the lesser antilles  dean s path through the caribbean devastated agricultural crops  particularly those of martinique and jamaica  upon reaching mexico  hurricane dean was a category 5  storm  but it missed major population centers and its exceptional category 5  strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the caribbean islands it passed as a category 2  storm through the affected regions  clean up and repair took months to complete  donations solicited by international aid organizations joined national funds in clearing roads  rebuilding houses  and replanting destroyed crops  in jamaica  where the damage was worst

to make landfall in the atlantic basin at category 5  intensity since hurricane andrew on august 24,  dean s category 5  landfall was in a sparsely populated area and thus far less damaging than

3  and its trailing bands were still over the lesser during the evening of august 17,  dean strengthened into a category 4  and continued to steadily grow in both size and intensity through the on august 18  the presence of a double eyewall was indicating an eyewall replacement cycle and causing short term fluctuations in these fluctuations did not affect the storm s well defined satellite operationally  dean was thought to have only been a category 4  on the 18th,  but post-storm  analysis shows that dean had become a 165  miles per hour (265  km h  category 5  that day  dean weakened very slightly on the morning of august 19  as it finished the eyewall replacement cycle and began to interact with the island of dean passed south of jamaica on the evening of august and began to intensify again that its eyewall replacement cycle was thought to be a concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of august 20,  but did not last long  the hurricane  still tracking west-northwest  under the influence of a strengthening deep-layered  high pressure system to the north  moved over waters with extremely high heat content and began to strengthen once the eyewall became even better defined during the and  at 8:35  pm ast on august 20  (0035  august 21,  utc   dean restrengthened to a category 5  hurricane  the highest rating on the saffir–simpson hurricane it
