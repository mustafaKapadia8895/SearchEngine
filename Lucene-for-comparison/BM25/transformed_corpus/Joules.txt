 joule -  wikipediathe joule   ˈdʒuːl    symbol  j   is a derived unit of energy in the international system of it is equal to the energy transferred to  or work done on  an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre (1  newton metre or n⋅m   it is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second  it is named after the english physicist james prescott joule terms firstly of base si units and then in terms of other si units where kg is the kilogram  m is the metre  s is the second  n is the newton  pa is the pascal  w is the watt  c is the coulomb  and v is the volt one joule can also be defined as this si unit is named after james prescott joule  as with every international system of units  si  unit named for a person  the first letter of its symbol is upper case  j   however  when an si unit is spelled out in english  it should always begin with a lower case letter  joule —except in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized  such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case  note that  degree celsius  conforms to this rule because the  d  is lowercase — based on the international system of units  section 5.2.in  mechanics  the concept of force  in some direction  has a close analog in the concept of torque  about some angle  a result of this similarity is that the si unit for torque is the newton metre  which works out algebraically to have the same dimensions as the joule  but they are not interchangeable  the cgpm has given the unit of energy the name joule  but has not given the unit of torque any special name  hence it is simply the newton metre  n⋅m  – a compound name derived from its constituent the use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a scalar – the dot product of a vector force and a vector displacement  by contrast  torque is a vector – the cross product of a distance vector and a force vector  torque and energy are related to one another by the equationwhere e is energy  τ is  the vector magnitude of  torque  and θ is the angle swept  in radians   since radians are dimensionless  it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions one joule in everyday life represents approximately since the joule is also a watt-second  and the common unit for electricity sales to homes is the kw⋅h (kilowatt-hour),  a kw⋅h is thus
