 the carolinas -  wikipediathe carolinas are the u s  states of north carolina and south carolina  considered collectively  combining north carolina s population of 10,042,802  and south carolina s of 4,896,146,  the carolinas have a population of 14,938,948  as of 2015.  if the carolinas were a single state of the united states  it would be the fifth-most  populous state  behind california  texas  florida  and new york  the carolinas were known as the province of carolina during america s early colonial period  from 1663  to 1710.  prior to that  the land was considered part of the colony and dominion of virginia  from 1609  to 1663.  the province  named carolina to honor king charles i of england  was divided into two colonies in 1729,  although the actual date is the subject of debate the territory  together with a part of florida  was declared as spanish territory by ponce de leon in 1512,  but the first europeans that paid the territory a visit never cared to name it  nor was it colonized by any spaniards  it was largely just proclaimed for a future that never came  but as french settlers arrived in 1562,  they were soon thrown out by the spaniards  however it was during this brief time that the  carolina  first was named  and the name referred to king charles ix of france  the territory was thereafter left to native americans until king charles ii of england  after the english restoration  in 1660  he gave all land between the 34th  and 36th  parallels to eight englishmen  the territory was named after the english king instead  which however had no impact on the spelling  in 1729  british politicians regretted this gift and redeemed the heirs of the first eight british inhabitants  now the carolinas became divided into north carolina and south carolina  which both became british colonies  both the new colonies were among the thirteen first states of the united robert heath (1575–1649)  was an english judge and politician who was also a member of the english house of commons from 1621  to 1625.  sir robert heath was granted charter over the lands between latitudes 31°  and 36°  north  from the atlantic to the pacific ocean  heath s patent required he plant a colony but that was never fully realized the 1663  charter granted the lords proprietor title to all of the land from the southern border of the colony of virginia at 36  degrees north to 31  degrees north  along the coast of present-day  georgia   in 1665,  the charter was revised slightly  with the northerly boundary extended to 36  degrees 30  minutes north to include the lands of the albemarle settlements along the albemarle sound who had left the colony of virginia  likewise  the southern boundary was moved south to 29  degrees north  just south of present-day  daytona beach  florida  which had the effect of including the existing spanish settlement at st  augustine  the charter also granted all the land  between these northerly and southerly bounds  from the atlantic ocean  westward to the shores of the pacific ocean the charter of 1663  chartered the territory as an english proprietary colony assigning rights to eight english noblemen  these noblemen are known as the lords proprietors of carolina forming the province of carolina between 1663  and 1729  there were many disagreements relating to defense  governance and the difference between the two differing agrarian styles employed by the inhabitants of the colony of virginia and that practiced by the planters arriving to charles town from the west indies and barbados in 1729  the province of carolina was divided when the descendants of seven of the eight lords proprietors sold their shares back to the crown  only the heirs of sir george carteret retained their original rights to what would become the granville district  both the province of north carolina and the province of south carolina became british crown colonies in culture of the carolinas is a distinct subset of larger southern culture  notably  the coastal carolina region was settled by europeans over a century before the inland regions of the and was influenced by the culture of the caribbean  especially barbados  many of the early governors during the unified period were though the two states both form part of the south  there are historically a number of differences in the settlement patterns  political development  and economic growth of the two states  for example  during the civil war  south carolina was the first southern state to secede from the while north carolina was the last state to secede  when nc did secede  it did so largely because north carolinians refused to give the federal government men to fight against their sister state  or allow them to pass through north carolina to make war on south carolina  north carolinians ultimately voted instead in all 100  counties to raise an army  join the confederacy  and go to during the war  south carolina was generally one of the strongest supporters of the confederacy  the war began in charleston  south carolina  where citadel cadets fired the opening shots at the union ship star of the north carolina was also a key confederate state  raising and giving more soldiers to the confederacy than any other southern at gettysburg  one in four confederate soldiers was from north carolina  despite the fact that some north carolinians  especially in the western part of the state  refused to support the north carolina s civil war governor  zebulon vance  was an outspoken critic of confederate president jefferson davis and frequently refused to obey davis s orders for reinforcements and supplies  vance insisted the soldiers and supplies would be needed for north carolina s confederate effort  however  during the seven day s battles  north carolina did send large numbers of troops for the general aid of the south as a during the war  the carolinas were both instrumental in keeping the confederacy alive  because of their deepwater ports in wilmington  nc and charleston  sc  these two cities were key in supplying southern armies with weapons  clothing  and ammunition  and producing food   provisions for southern most of the 20th  century  south carolina was a bastion of the  solid democratic south  with almost no republican officeholders  and the state frequently elected politicians who were outspoken supporters of racial segregation  north carolina  while mostly democratic  contained a large republican minority – the state voted republican in the presidential election of 1928  and elected several republican congressmen  governors  and senators from 1868–1928  – and north carolina was widely known as one of the more progressive southern states on the issue of segregation and civil rights  in 1947,  the journalist john gunther wrote   that north carolina is by a good deal the most progressive southern state will  i imagine  be agreed to by almost on the other hand  he described south carolina as  one of the poorest american states  and probably one of the in describing the differences between the two states  gunther noted that  in 1947,  divorce in north carolina  may be granted simply on the ground of absence of cohabitation  south carolina is the one american state in which divorce is not north carolina s nickname for many years was  a vale of humility between two mountains of conceit   the  mountains  were virginia and south north carolina being a swing state  and south carolina being a red one  they are technically the country s two most politically similar states  according to a comparison of the states along a range of 19  variables performed by the statistician nate silver in like much of the south  the carolinas have been however  the predominance of certain crops has influenced the regional needed like other states  until after world war ii north carolina remained primarily a region of small farms and factories heavily dependent on just a few labor-intensive  crops  relying on sharecropping and tenancy  especially for black laborers  the carolinas are distinct for their economic dependence on tobacco as well as on cotton and rice  and for their many small-scale  furniture  textile  and tobacco small industries gave the carolinas  in particular nc  a more significant industrial base than most southern states  but as increased mechanization in the textiles  apparel  and furniture industries combined with the decline of the tobacco many rural and small urban communities however  during the 1990s,  both states began to experience growth in the technological and banking sectors  bringing jobs and population these changes  as with earlier industrialization  were more pronounced in north carolina  and sc has experienced a slower rate of economic growth for several carolinas have three professional sports teams in the big four major leagues  supported by both states  the three teams are all based in nc  two in charlotte and the third in raleigh  all of the sports teams are fairly recent additions  the oldest team  the nfl s panthers  was established in 1995,  while the youngest  the hornets  was added to the nba in 2004  as the charlotte bobcats  although a prior nba team also named the hornets played in charlotte from 1988  before leaving for new orleans in 2002.  the bobcats were renamed the hornets in may 2014,  one season after the former new orleans hornets decided to rebrand themselves as the pelicans  of all the teams  the hurricanes are the most successful  being the only team with a championship the carolinas are home to a number of nba superstars  such as chris paul  james worthy  john wall  and michael jordan  from nc  and kevin garnett  jermaine o neal  ray allen  and raymond felton  from sc   six of these players are all stars  four are nba champions  and john wall and james worthy were the number 1  draft picks in the 2010  nba draft and 1982  nba draft  respectively  a disproportional number of basketball players come from the carolinas  on par with such big cities as new york city and los angeles  while the hornets do little to generate buzz in the carolinas  they are home to three of the most successful collegiate men s basketball teams in the ncaa  the north carolina tarheels  north carolina state wolfpack and the duke blue devils  all three schools are fierce rivals who have combined to win 12  ncaa men s division i basketball championships  unc has 5,  duke has 5,  north carolina state has 2).according  to the prefatory notes to volume 5  of the colonial records of north carolina  the process of determining the boundary between north and south carolina began in 1720   when the purpose to erect a third province in carolina  with savannah for its northern began  on 8  january an agreement between the two colonies said for the border  to begin 30  miles southwest of the cape fear river  and to be run at that parallel distance the whole course of said river   the next june governor robert johnson of south carolina said the border should start 30  miles southwest of the source of the cape fear  due west as far as the south sea   unless the  waccamaw river lyes within 30  miles of the cape fear which would make the waccamaw the boundary  north carolina agreed to this until the discovery that the cape fear headwaters were very close to virginia  which would not have  permitted any extension on the part of north carolina to the in 1732,  governor george burrington of north carolina stated in timothy s southern gazette that territory north of the waccamaw was in north carolina  to which johnson replied that south carolina claimed the land  johnson also said that when the two met before the board of trade in london two years earlier  burrington had  insisted that the waccamaw should be the boundary from its mouth to its while south carolina agreed the border should be located 30  miles from the mouth  not the source  johnson said this was  only a mistake in wording carolinas selected commissioners to survey the line between them  the plan called for the line to run northwest to 35  degrees latitude  unless the pee dee river was reached first  in which case it would run along the pee dee to 35  degrees north  then the line would run west to catawba town  though if the town were north of the line  the line was to run around catawba to keep it in south may 1735,  the surveyors went from the cape fear westward thirty miles along the coast  then they turned northwest and marked the location with stakes  the surveyors agreed to meet again on september 18.  however  only the north carolina team returned at that time  extending the line northwest 70  miles  the south carolina team arrived in october and only followed the previous line for 40  miles because they had not been paid  a deputy surveyor marked where the pee dee crossed the 35th  parallel  an extension of the line in 1737  ran 22  miles to a stake in a however  the stake placed at the endpoint of the survey was 12  miles too far 1764,  a second extension ran 62  miles westward  in 1772,  after making adjustments to keep the catawba indians in south carolina   extended in a due west course from the confluence of the north and south forks of the catawba river to tryon however  this extension was based on the erroneous position of the 1737  stake  removing 422,000  acres from south joseph caldwell  president of the university of north carolina at chapel hill  found that the line west of the pee dee did not run along the 35th  parallel  but 12  miles to the south  however  the western part of the line ran far enough to the north to make up for the west of this point the border was shifted to run north of the 35th  parallel so that the total areas of the states would return to what was intended  although the accuracy of this part of the survey was marred by a magnetic anomaly in the charlotte  north carolina carolina did not agree to the line of 1772  until a 1905  survey determined the border between scotland county  north carolina and marlboro county  south carolina  a 1928  survey decided the border between horry county  south carolina and brunswick and columbus counties in north the mid-1990s,  duke energy determined that the border between the carolinas needed to be re-surveyed,  as the company was selling and donating land in the jocassee gorge area  which included parts of both also  with more people living outside cities  the precise boundaries of fire  tax  and school district lines needed to be known  this was especially a problem in the mountains  where people had previously lived in valleys  not on the ridges where the border was  a 15-year  plan to re-establish  the boundary began  using maps from the 1813–1815  survey and gps technology  a few stone markers still read   nc sc 1815  but other locations were marked with trees which no longer carolina had recently been involved in a costly legal battle with georgia over a small number of islands in the savannah river  and wanted to avoid the expense of a lawsuit regarding the north carolina border  so the two states agreed in 1993  to cooperate in resurveying the border  the effort included using colonial-era  maps to reconstruct the positions of trees making the border that had long since died  and tracking down the original positions of stone markers that had been 18  years and $980,000,  it was predicted that the process of determining the border between the carolinas would be complete in financial problems delayed the last survey until october 2012,  meaning the results were not expected to be known until spring it was found that a gas station and 30  homes could change states  lake wylie mini has been located in south carolina  along u s  route 321,  and the move to north carolina would result in higher gas taxes and change laws on beer and the state legislatures involved expect to pass laws alleviating the concerns those changing states would joint boundary commission met in february 2014  in monroe  north carolina to determine what actions still needed to be taken  the persons living in 50  homes that changed states would have to get driver s licenses and register to vote in their new states  legislative action could allow people to keep utilities  avoid back taxes to the new state  and continue in the same schools  lake wylie minimarket could be grandfathered  or congress could change the defined border at the store s location  though the commission intended to avoid such an as of august 2014,  the states were expected to pass legislation to mitigate many of the negative impacts to affected june 1,  2016,  the south carolina house of representatives passed a bill setting the border  north carolina s senate also passed a bill  which also had to clear the house  north carolina governor pat mccrory signed his state s bill in june  three families who actually lived in north carolina had south carolina addresses  and 16  south carolina residents had believed they lived in north on december 9,  2016,  mccrory announced that he signed a four-page  executive order formally defining the border between the two states based on the 20  years of
