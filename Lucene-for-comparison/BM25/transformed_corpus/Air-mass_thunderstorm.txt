 air-mass  thunderstorm -  wikipediaan air-mass  thunderstorm  also called an  single cell   or  garden variety  is a thunderstorm that is generally weak and usually not severe  these storms form in environments where at least some amount of convective available potential energy  cape  is present  but very low levels of wind shear and helicity  the lifting source  which is a crucial factor in thunderstorm development  is usually the result of uneven heating of the surface  though they can be induced by weather fronts and other low-level  boundaries associated with wind convergence  the energy needed for these storms to form comes in the form of insolation  or solar radiation  air-mass  thunderstorms do not move quickly  last no longer than an hour  and have the threats of lightning  as well as showery light  moderate  or heavy rainfall  heavy rainfall can interfere with microwave transmissions within the atmosphere lightning characteristics are related to characteristics of the parent thunderstorm  and could induce wildfires near thunderstorms with minimal rainfall  on unusual occasions there could be a weak downburst and small hail  they are common in temperate zones during a summer afternoon  like all thunderstorms  the mean-layered  wind field the storms form within determine motion  when the deep-layered  wind flow is light  outflow boundary progression will determine storm movement  since thunderstorms can be a hazard to aviation  pilots are advised to fly above any haze layers within regions of better visibility and to avoid flying under the anvil of these thunderstorms  which can be regions where hail falls from the parent thunderstorm  vertical wind shear is also a hazard near the base of thunderstorms which have generated outflow boundaries the trigger for the lift of the initial cumulus cloud can be insolation heating the ground producing thermals  areas where two winds converge forcing air upwards  or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation  the moisture rapidly cools into liquid drops of water due to the cooler temperatures at high altitude  which appears as cumulus clouds  as the water vapor condenses into liquid  latent heat is released which warms the air  causing it to become less dense than the surrounding dry air  the air tends to rise in an updraft through the process of convection  hence the term convective precipitation   this creates a low-pressure  zone beneath the forming thunderstorm  otherwise known as a cumulonimbus cloud  in a typical thunderstorm  approximately 5×108  kg of water vapor is lifted into the earth s as they form in areas of minimal vertical wind the thunderstorm s rainfall creates a moist and relatively cool outflow boundary with undercuts the storm s low level inflow  and quickly causes dissipation  waterspouts  small hail  and strong wind gusts can occur in association with these known as single cell thunderstorms  these are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales  they also occur in the cool unstable air which often follows the passage of a cold front from the sea during winter  within a cluster of thunderstorms  the term  cell  refers to each separate principal updraft  thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation  as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary which sets up new thunderstorm development  such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability  hence the term  air mass thunderstorm   when such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them  it is known as a pulse severe storm  pulse severe storms are poorly organized due to the minimal vertical wind shear in the storm s environment and occur randomly in time and space  making them difficult to forecast  between formation and dissipation  single cell thunderstorms normally last 20–30  two major ways thunderstorms move are via advection of the wind and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture  many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the earth s troposphere  or the lowest 8  kilometres (5.0  mi  of the earth s atmosphere  younger thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the earth s surface than more mature thunderstorms as they tend not to be as tall  if the gust front  or leading edge of the outflow boundary  moves ahead of the thunderstorm  the thunderstorm s motion will move in tandem with the gust front  this is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation  hp   such as air-mass  thunderstorms  when thunderstorms merge  which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other  the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates future motion of the merged cell  the stronger the mean wind  the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion  on weather radar  storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to rain  or showery precipitation  occurs from cumulonimbus clouds  it falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity  convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time  as convective clouds such as thunderstorms have limited horizontal extent  most precipitation in the tropics appears to be graupel and hail are good indicators of convective precipitation and in mid-latitudes,  convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts  squall lines  and warm high rainfall rates are associated with thunderstorms with larger raindrops  heavy rainfall leads to fading of microwave transmissions starting above the frequency of 10  gigahertz  ghz   but is more severe above frequencies of 15  between lightning frequency and the height of precipitation within thunderstorms have been found  thunderstorms which show radar returns above 14  kilometres (8.7  mi  in height are associated with storms which have more than ten lightning flashes per minute  there is also a correlation between the total lightning rate and the size of the thunderstorm  its updraft velocity  and amount of graupel over land  the same relationships fail over tropical oceans  lightning from low precipitation  lp  thunderstorms is one of the leading causes of areas where these thunderstorms form in isolation and horizontal visibility is good  pilots can evade these storms rather easily  in more moist atmospheres which become hazy  pilots navigate above the haze layer in order to get a better vantage point of these storms  flying under the anvil of thunderstorms is not advised  as hail is more likely to fall in such areas outside the thunderstorm s main rain when an outflow boundary forms due to a shallow layer of rain-cooled  air spreading out near ground level from the parent thunderstorm  both speed and directional wind shear can result at the leading edge of the three-dimensional  boundary  the stronger the outflow boundary is  the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear will
