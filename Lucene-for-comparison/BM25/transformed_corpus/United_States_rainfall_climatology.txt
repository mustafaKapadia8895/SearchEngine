 united states rainfall climatology -  wikipediathe characteristics of united states rainfall climatology differ significantly across the united states and those under united states sovereignty  late summer and fall extratropical cyclones bring a majority of the precipitation which falls across western  southern  and southeast alaska annually  during the winter  and spring  pacific storm systems bring hawaii and the western united states most of their precipitation  nor easters moving down the east coast bring cold season precipitation to the carolinas  mid-atlantic  and new england states  lake-effect  snows add to precipitation potential downwind of the great lakes  as well as great salt lake and the finger lakes during the cold season  the snow to liquid ratio across the contiguous united states averages 13:1,  meaning 13  inches (330  mm  of snow melts down to 1  inch (25  mm  of the summer  the north american monsoon combined with gulf of california and gulf of mexico moisture moving around the subtropical ridge in the atlantic ocean bring the promise of afternoon and evening air-mass  thunderstorms to the southern tier of the country as well as the great plains  equatorward of the subtropical ridge  tropical cyclones enhance precipitation across southern and eastern sections of the country  as well as puerto rico  the united states virgin islands  the northern mariana islands  guam  and american samoa  over the top of the ridge  the jet stream brings a summer precipitation maximum to the great lakes  large thunderstorm areas known as mesoscale convective complexes move through the plains  midwest  and great lakes during the warm season  contributing up to 10%  of the annual precipitation to the region the el niño–southern oscillation affects the precipitation distribution  by altering rainfall patterns across the west  midwest  the southeast  and throughout the tropics  there is also evidence that global warming is leading to increased precipitation to the eastern portions of north america  while droughts are becoming more frequent in the western portions the eastern part of the contiguous united states east of the 98th  meridian  the mountains of the pacific northwest  the willamette valley  and the sierra nevada range are the wetter portions of the nation  with average rainfall exceeding 30  inches (760  mm  per year  the drier areas are the desert southwest  great basin  valleys of northeast arizona  eastern utah  and central increased warming within urban heat islands leads to an increase in rainfall downwind of averages over 50  inches (1,270  mm  of precipitation a year  while other areas in southeast alaska receive over 275  inches (6,980  mm   south central alaska does not get nearly as much rain as the southeast of alaska  though it does get more snow  on average  anchorage receives 16  inches (406  mm  of precipitation a year  with around 75  inches (1,905  mm  of snow  the northern coast of the gulf of alaska receives up to 150  inches (3,800  mm  of precipitation across western sections of the state  the northern side of the seward peninsula is a desert with less than 10  inches (250  mm  of precipitation annually  while some locations between dillingham and bethel average around 100  inches (2,540  mm  of precipitation  inland  often less than 10  inches (250  mm  falls a year  but what precipitation falls during the winter tends to stay throughout the la niña events lead to drier than normal conditions  while el niño events do not have a correlation towards dry or wet conditions  precipitation increases by 10  to 40  percent when the pacific decadal oscillation is september through may  extratropical cyclones from the pacific ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season  this shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the and also brings the potential for heavy rain the west coast occasionally experiences ocean-effect  showers  usually in the form of rain at lower elevations south of the mouth of the columbia river  these occur whenever an arctic air mass from western canada is drawn westward out over the pacific ocean  typically by way of the fraser valley  returning shoreward around a center of low pressure  strong onshore flow is brought into the mountain ranges of the west  focusing significant precipitation into the rocky mountains  with rain shadows occurring in the harney great the central valley of and the lower colorado river in general  rainfall amounts are lower on the southern portions of the west the biggest recipients of the precipitation are the coastal ranges such as the olympic the and the sierra nevada lesser amounts fall upon the continental divide  cold-season  precipitation into this region is the main supply of water to area rivers  such as the colorado river and rio grande  and also acts as the main source of water to people living in this portion of the united during el niño events  increased precipitation is expected in california due to a more southerly  zonal  storm california also enters a wet pattern when thunderstorm activity within the tropics associated with the madden–julian oscillation nears 150e  during la niña  increased precipitation is diverted into the pacific northwest due to a more northerly storm southern and southeastern sides of the great salt lake receive significant lake-effect  snow  since the great salt lake never freezes  the lake-effect  can affect the weather along the wasatch front year the lake-effect  largely contributes to the 55  inches (140  cm  to 80  inches (200  cm  annual snowfall amounts recorded south and east of the with average snowfall amounts exceeding 600  inches (1,500  cm  in the wasatch the snow  which is often very light and dry due to the desert climate  is referred to as  the greatest snow on earth  in the mountains  lake-effect  snow contributes to approximately 6-8  snowfalls per year in salt lake city  with approximately 10%  of the city s precipitation being contributed by the north american monsoon  nam  occurs from early july into september  originating over mexico and spreading into the southwest united states by mid-july.  this allows the wet season to start in the southwest during the summer rather than early fall as seen across the remainder of the within the united states  it affects arizona  new mexico  nevada  utah  colorado  west texas  and california  the north american monsoon is known to many as the summer  southwest  mexican or arizona it is also sometimes called the desert monsoon as a large part of the affected area is desert when precipitable water values near 1.32  inches (34  mm   brief but often torrential thunderstorms and the hurricane force winds and hail can occur  especially over mountainous this activity is occasionally enhanced by the passage of retrograding (westward-moving)  upper cyclones moving under the subtropical ridge and the entrainment of the remnants of tropical tropical cyclones from the eastern pacific contribute to the moisture within the monsoon system  and bring up to 20  percent of the average annual rainfall to southern flash flooding is a serious danger during the monsoon season  dry washes can become raging rivers in an instant  even when no storms are visible as a storm can cause a flash flood tens of miles away  lightning strikes are also a significant danger  because it is dangerous to be caught in the open when these storms suddenly appear  many golf courses in arizona have thunderstorm warning systems as much as 45%  of the annual rainfall across new mexico occurs during the summer many desert plants are adapted to take advantage of this brief wet season  because of the monsoons  the sonoran and mojave are considered relatively  wet  when ranked among other deserts such as the sahara  monsoons play a vital role in managing wildfire threat by providing moisture at higher elevations and feeding desert streams  heavy monsoon rain can lead to excess winter plant growth  in turn a summer wildfire risk  a lack of monsoon rain can hamper summer seeding  reducing excess winter plant growth but worsening drought downslope winds off the rocky mountains can aid in forming the dry line  major drought episodes in the midwestern united states are associated with an amplification of the upper tropospheric subtropical  or monsoon  ridge across the west and plains  along with a weakening of the western edge of the  bermuda during the summer  a southerly low-level  jet draws moisture from the gulf of mexico  additional moisture comes from more local sources  especially transpiring vegetation  maximum precipitation generally occurs in late spring and early summer  with minimum precipitation in winter  during la niña events  the storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions  in the form of increased snowfall  to the midwestern states  as well as hot and dry convective season for the plains ranges between may and september  organized systems of thunderstorms known as mesoscale convective systems develop over the region during this period  with a bulk of the activity occurring between midnight and 6  a m  local time  the time of maximum precipitation during the day gradually varies from late afternoon near the slopes of the rockies to early morning near the ohio river in part reflecting the west-to-east  propagation of mesoscale convective systems  mesoscale convective systems bring 30  to 70  percent of the annual warm season rainfall to the an especially long-lived  and well-organized  type of mesoscale convective system called a mesoscale convective complex produces on average 8%  to 18%  of the annual warm season rainfall across the plains and squall lines account for 30%  of the large thunderstorm complexes which move through the subtropical jet stream brings in upper level moisture from the pacific ocean during the cold season  ahead of storm systems  significant moisture becomes drawn in from the gulf of mexico  which increases moisture within the atmospheric column and leads to precipitation ahead of extratropical cyclones  during the el niño portion of enso  increased precipitation falls along the gulf coast and southeast due to a stronger than normal  and more southerly  polar jet rare ocean effect snows are possible along the coast of eastern in the area around memphis  tennessee and across the state of mississippi  there are two rainfall maxima in the winter and across georgia and south carolina  the first of the annual precipitation maxima occurs in late winter  during february or alabama has an annual rainfall maximum in winter or spring and a dry the summer  the subtropical ridge in the atlantic ocean strengthens  bringing in increasingly humid air from the warm atlantic  caribbean  and gulf of mexico  once precipitable water values exceed 1.25  inches (32  mm   afternoon and evening thunderstorms break out at the western periphery of the subtropical ridge across the southeast on a daily basis  summer is the time of the second rainfall maximum during the year across georgia  and the time of the main rainfall maximum in evidence shows that increased air pollution is causing rainfall to reach a maximum in intensity during the middle of the during the late summer and fall  tropical cyclones move into the region from the atlantic and gulf of mexico  supplying portions of the area with one-quarter  of their annual rainfall  on average  fall is the time of the rainfall minimum across sometimes  gulf moisture sneaks up the front range of rockies as far north as the northern high plains  bringing higher dewpoint air into states such as wyoming and montana extratropical cyclones can bring moderate to heavy snowfall during the cold season  on the backside of these systems  particularly those moving through the eastern united states  lake effect snowfall is possible  low level cold in the winter sweeping in from canada combine with relatively warmer  unfrozen lakes to produce dramatic lake-effect  snow on the eastern and southern shores of the great lake-effect  precipitation produces a significant difference between the snowfall around the great lakes  sometimes within small distances  lake effect snowfall accounts for 30  to 60  percent of the annual snowfall near the coasts of the great lake erie has the distinction of being the only great lake capable of completely freezing over during the winter due to its relative once frozen  the resulting ice cover alleviates lake-effect  snow downwind of the lake  the influence of the great lakes allows the region to lie within a humid continental climate spring through summer is the wettest time of the year for the weather systems in the westerlies that cause precipitation move along jet stream  which migrates north into the region by summer  this also increases the likelihood for severe weather to develop due to stronger upper-level  divergence in its mesoscale convective complexes move into the region from the plains from may through august  with june the peak month for michigan  these systems contribute about 2%  of the annual precipitation for the also  remnants of tropical cyclones occasionally move northward into the region  though their overall contribution to precipitation across the region is from the spring through the summer  areas near the shores of the relatively cooler great lakes develop sea breezes  which lowers rainfall amounts near the immediate precipitation across the region show maxima along the coastal plain and along the mountains of the appalachians  between 28  inches (710  mm  and 62  inches (1,600  mm  of precipitation falls annually across the seasonally  there are slight changes to precipitation distribution through the year  for example  burlington  vermont has a summer maximum and a winter minimum  in contrast  portland  maine has a fall and winter maximum  with a summer minimum in temporally  a maximum in precipitation is seen around three peak times  3  a m   10  a m   and 6  p m  during the summer  the 6  p m  peak is most extratropical cyclones  known as nor easters  bring a bulk of the wintry precipitation to the region during the cold season as they track parallel to the coastline  forming along the natural temperature gradient of the gulf stream before moving up the the appalachian mountains largely shield new york city and philadelphia from picking up any lake-effect  snow  though ocean-effect  snows are possible near cape the finger lakes of new york are long enough for lake-effect  precipitation  lake-effect  snow from the finger lakes occurs in upstate new york until those lakes freeze bay-effect  snows fall downwind of delaware bay  chesapeake bay  and massachusetts bay when the basic criteria are met  ocean effect snows are possible downwind of the gulf stream across the the summer and early fall  mesoscale convective systems can move into the area from canada and the great lakes  tropical cyclones and their remains occasionally move into the region from the south and recently  the region has experienced a couple heavy rainfall events that exceeded the 50-year  return period  during october 1996  and october 1998,  which suggest an increase in heavy rainfall along the although not usually associated with tropics  falls at higher elevations on the big island  on mauna loa as well as mauna kea  which reaches an altitude of 13,796  feet (4,205  m  in some winter months  snow only rarely falls on maui s haleakala  mount waiʻaleʻale  waiʻaleʻale   on the island of kauai  is notable for its extreme rainfall  as it has the second highest average annual rainfall on earth  with 460  inches (12,000  storm systems affect the state with heavy rains between october and march  showers are common across the island chain  but thunderstorms are relatively rare  local climates vary considerably on each island due to their topography  divisible into windward  koʻolau  and leeward  kona  regions based upon location relative to the higher mountains  the kona coast is the only area in hawaii with a summer precipitation maximum  windward sides face the east to northeast trade winds and receive much more rainfall  leeward sides are drier and sunnier  with less rain and less cloud in the late winter and spring during el niño events  drier than average conditions can be expected in islands have a tropical marine climate moderated by seasonal northeast trade winds  there is a dry season which stretches from december to june  and a rainy season from july to saipan s average annual precipitation is 82.36  inches (2,092  mm   with 67  percent falling during the rainy typhoons frequent the island chain  which can lead to excessive climate is moderated by east to northeast trade winds through the year  the average annual rainfall for the island is 86  inches (2,200  there is a distinct dry season from january to june  and a rainy season from july to typhoons frequent the island  which can lead to excessive rainfall  during el niño years  dry season precipitation averages below normal  however  the threat of a tropical cyclone is over triple what is normal during el niño years  so extreme shorter duration rainfall events are samoa s climate regime is dominated by southeast trade winds  the island dependency is wet  with annual rainfall averaging near 120  inches (3,000  mm  at the airport  with amounts closer to 200  inches (5,100  mm  in other there is a distinct rainy season when tropical cyclones occasionally visit between november and april  the dry season lasts from may to during el niño events  precipitation averages about 10  percent above normal  while la niña events lead to precipitation amounts which average close to 10  percent below is a pronounced rainy season from april to november across the commonwealth  encompassing the annual hurricane season  due to the commonwealth s topography  rainfall varies greatly across the island  pico del este averages 171.09  inches (4,346  mm  of rainfall yearly while magueyes island averages only 29.32  inches (745  mm  a despite known changes in tropical cyclone activity due to changes in the el niño southern oscillation there is no known relationship between rainfall in puerto rico and the enso cycle  however  when values of the north atlantic oscillation are high during the winter  precipitation is lower than average for puerto there have not been any documented cases of snow falling within puerto rico  though occasionally it is brought in from elsewhere as a publicity climate of the united states virgin islands has sustained easterly trade winds through the year  there is a rainy season which lasts from september to november  when hurricanes are more prone to visit the island the average rainfall through the island chain ranges from 51.55  inches (1,309  mm  at annually to 37.79  inches (960  mm  at east temperatures tend to increase evaporation which leads to more precipitation  as average global temperatures have risen  average global precipitation has also increased  precipitation has generally increased over land north of 30°n  from 1900  to 2005,  but declined over the tropics since the 1970s.  eastern portions of north america have become wetter  there has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century  as well as an increase since the 1970s  in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics  over the contiguous united states  total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1  percent per century since 1900,  with the greatest increases within the east north central climate region (11.6  percent per century  and the south (11.1  percent   hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (−9.25  from this excess precipitation  crop losses are expected to increase by us$3  billion (2002  dollars  annually over the next 30
