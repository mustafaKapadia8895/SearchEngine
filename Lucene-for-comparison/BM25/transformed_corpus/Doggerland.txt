 doggerland -  wikipediadoggerland was an area now beneath the southern north sea that connected great britain to continental europe during and after the last glacial period  it was flooded by rising sea levels around 6,500–6,200  bc  geological surveys have suggested that it stretched from britain s east coast to the netherlands and the western coasts of germany and the peninsula of it was probably a rich habitat with human habitation in the mesolithic although rising sea levels gradually reduced it to low-lying  islands before its final submergence  possibly following a tsunami caused by the storegga archaeological potential of the area had first been identified in the early 20th  century  but interest intensified in 1931  when a fishing trawler operating east of the wash dragged up a barbed antler point that was subsequently dated to a time when the area was tundra  vessels have dragged up remains of mammoth  lion and other animals  as well as a few prehistoric tools and was named after the dogger bank  which in turn was named after the 17th  century dutch fishing boats called doggers until the middle pleistocene  britain was a peninsula of europe  connected by the massive chalk weald–artois anticline across the straits of dover  during the anglian glaciation  approximately 450,000  years ago  an ice sheet filled much of the north sea  with a large proglacial lake in the southern part fed by the rhine  scheldt and thames river systems  the catastrophic overflow of this lake carved a channel through the anticline  leading to the formation of the channel river  which carried the combined scheldt and thames to the atlantic  this probably created the potential for britain to become isolated from the continent during periods of high sea level  although some scientists argue that the final break did not occur until a second ice-dammed  lake overflowed during the mis8  or mis6  glaciations  around 340,000  or 240,000  years the most recent glaciation of the last glacial maximum  which ended around 18,000  years ago  the north sea and much of the british isles were covered with glacial ice and the sea level was about 120  m (390  ft  lower  subsequently  the climate became warmer and during the late glacial maximum around 12,000  bc britain  as well as much of the north sea and english channel  was an expanse of low-lying  including the contours of the present seabed  indicates that after the first main ice age  the watershed between the north sea and english channel extended east from east anglia then south-east  to the hook of holland  rather than across the strait of dover  the seine  thames  meuse  scheldt and rhine rivers joined and flowed west along the english channel as a wide slow river before eventually reaching the atlantic at about 10,000  bc the north-facing  coastal area of doggerland had a coastline of lagoons  saltmarshes  mudflats and beaches as well as inland streams  rivers  marshes and lakes  it may have been the richest hunting  fowling and fishing ground in europe in the mesolithic big river system found by 3d  seismic survey was the  shotton river   which drained the south-east  part of the dogger bank hill area into the east end of the outer silver pit lake  it is named after birmingham geologist frederick william shotton as ice melted at the end of the last glacial period of the current ice age  sea levels rose and the land began to tilt in an isostatic adjustment as the huge weight of ice lessened  doggerland eventually became submerged  cutting off what was previously the british peninsula from the european mainland by around 6500  the dogger bank  an upland area of doggerland  remained an island until at least 5000  key stages are now believed to have included the gradual evolution of a large tidal bay between eastern england and dogger bank by 9000  bce and a rapid sea-level  rise thereafter  leading to dogger bank becoming an island and great britain becoming physically disconnected from the recent hypothesis postulates that much of the remaining coastal land was flooded by a megatsunami around 6200  bce  caused by a submarine landslide off the coast of norway known as the storegga slide  this suggests   that the storegga slide tsunami would have had a catastrophic impact on the contemporary coastal mesolithic population     britain finally became separated from the continent and in cultural terms  the mesolithic there goes its own a study published in 2014  suggested that the only remaining parts of doggerland at the time of the storegga slide were low-lying  islands  but supported the view that the area had been abandoned at about the same time as the view speculates that the storegga tsunami devastated doggerland but then ebbed back into the sea  and that later lake agassiz  in north america  burst releasing so much fresh water that sea levels over about two years rose to flood much of doggerland and make britain an prehistoric existence of what is now known as doggerland was established in the late 19th  century  h  g  wells referred to the concept in his short story a story of the stone age of 1897,  set in  a time when one might have walked dryshod from france  as we call it now  to england  and when a broad and sluggish thames flowed through its marshes to meet its father rhine  flowing through a wide and level country that is under water in these latter days  and which we know by the name of the north sea   fifty thousand years ago it was  fifty thousand years if the reckoning of geologists is correct   though most of the action seems to occur in what is now surrey and kent  but stretching out to remains of plants brought to the surface from dogger bank were studied in 1913  by paleobiologist clement reid  and the remains of animals and worked flints from the neolithic period had also been in his book the antiquity of man of 1915,  anatomist sir arthur keith discussed the archaeological potential of the in 1931,  the trawler colinda hauled up a lump of peat whilst fishing near the ower bank  40  kilometres (25  mi  east of norfolk  the peat was found to contain a barbed antler point  possibly used as a harpoon or fish spear  220  millimetres (8.5  in  long  which dated from between 4,000  and 10,000  bc when the area was was reinvigorated in the 1990s  by professor bryony coles  who named the area  doggerland    after the great banks in the southern north and produced speculative maps of the although she recognised that the current relief of the southern north sea seabed is not a sound guide to the topography of this topography has more recently begun to be reconstructed more authoritatively using seismic survey data obtained from oil skull fragment of a neanderthal  dated at over 40,000  years old  was recovered from material dredged from the middeldiep  some 16  kilometres (10  mi  off the coast of zeeland  and exhibited in leiden in in march 2010  it was reported that recognition of the potential archaeological importance of the area could affect the future development of offshore wind july 2012,  the results of a fifteen-year  study of doggerland by the universities of st andrews  dundee  and aberdeen  including artefacts survey results  were displayed at the royal society in richard bates of st andrews university have speculated for years on the lost land s existence from bones dredged by fishermen all over the north sea  but it s only since working with oil companies in the last few years that we have been able to re-create  what this lost land looked like     we have now been able to model its flora and fauna  build up a picture of the ancient people that lived there and begin to understand some of the dramatic events that subsequently changed the land  including the sea rising and a devastating tsunami in september 2015,  archaeologists at the university of bradford announced their project to chart doggerland in 3d,  and to study dna from deep sea core
