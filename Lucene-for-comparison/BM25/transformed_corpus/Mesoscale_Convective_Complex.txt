 mesoscale convective complex -  wikipediaa mesoscale convective complex  mcc  is a unique kind of mesoscale convective system which is defined by characteristics observed in infrared satellite imagery  they are long-lived,  often form nocturnally  and commonly contain heavy rainfall  wind  hail  lightning  and possibly mesoscale convective complex has either an area of cloud top of 100,000  km2  or greater with temperature less than or equal to -32  °c  or an area of cloud top of 50,000  km2  with temperature less than or equal to -52  °c  size definitions must be met for 6  hours or greater  its maximum extent is defined as when cloud shield reaches maximum area  its eccentricity  minor axis major axis  is greater than or equal to 0.7  at maximum extent mccs commonly develop from the merging of thunderstorms into a squall line which eventually meet the mcc criteria  furthermore  some mcc formation can be tracked from the plains in colorado back to the rocky mountains  these are called  orogenic  the characteristics of the meteorological environment that mccs form in are strong warm air advection into the formation environment by a southerly low-level  jet stream  wind maximum   strong moisture advection which increases the relative humidity of the formation environment  convergence of air near the surface  and divergence of air aloft  these conditions are most prominent in the region ahead of an upper level trough  the systems begin in the afternoon as scattered thunderstorms which organize overnight in the presence of wind shear  wind speed and direction changes with height   the probability for severe weather is highest in the early stages of formation  during the afternoon  the mcc persists at its mature and strongest stage overnight and into the early morning in which the rainfall is characterized as stratiform rainfall  rather than convective rainfall which occurs with thunderstorms   dissipation of the mcc commonly occurs during the morning hours  after dissipation  a remnant mid-level  circulation known as a mesoscale convective vortex can initiate another round of thunderstorms later in the day the structure of an mcc can be separated into three layers  the low-levels  of the mcc near the surface  the mid-levels  in the middle of the troposphere  and the upper-levels  in the upper-troposphere.  near the surface  the mcc exhibits high pressure  with an outflow boundary  or mesoscale cold front  at its leading edge  this high pressure is caused by the cooling of the air from the evaporation of rainfall  commonly referred to as a cold pool   in the mid-levels  (mid-troposphere),  the mcc exhibits a cyclonic  counterclockwise  rotating low pressure which is warm compared to the surrounding environment  referred to as a warm core   this mid-level  circulation is referred to as a mesoscale convective vortex  the upper-levels  contain an anti-cyclonic   clockwise  rotating high pressure which is a sign of divergence of air  this high pressure is colder relative to its surrounding environment  this divergence at upper-levels  and convergence of air at the surface along the cool pool s outflow boundary results in rising motion which aids maintenance of the mcc mccs produce heavy rainfall which can lead to flooding and other hydrological impacts  mccs are found in the united states during the spring and summer months  warm season   the indian monsoon region  the west pacific and throughout africa and south america  in particular  the heavy rainfall from mccs accounts for a significant portion of the precipitation during the warm season in the united as the warm season progresses  the favorable regions for mcc formation shift from the southern plains of the united states northward  by july and august  the north-central  states become the most the mid-level  low pressure areas of mccs have also been tracked to the origin of some tropical cyclones  and on rare occasions vice versa one of the most notable mccs occurred overnight on 19  july 1977,  in western pennsylvania  the mcc resulted in heavy rainfall which led to the disastrous flooding of johnstown  pennsylvania  the complex was tracked 96  hours back to south dakota and produced copious amounts of rain throughout the northern united states before producing up to 12  inches (300  mm  of rain in johnstown a second notable mcc brought destructive straight-line  winds to southern ontario  upstate new york  vermont  massachusetts  connecticut  and rhode island on the morning of 15  july 1995.  the mcc produced winds in excess of 160  km h (100  mph  and was responsible for seven deaths  widespread destruction of forests in the adirondack and berkshire mountains  and over $500  million in property formation of large mccs over the same general area for a large percentage of the nights in april to july 1993  and their tendency to persist well into the next day was a large part of the cause for the flooding in much of the central united states that year
