 pannonian basin -  wikipediathe pannonian basin or carpathian is a large basin in central europe  the geomorphological term pannonian plain is more widely used for roughly the same region though with a somewhat different sense  with only the lowlands  the plain that remained when the pliocene epoch pannonian sea dried out it is a geomorphological subsystem of the alps-himalaya  system  specifically a sediment-filled  back-arc  most of the plain consists of the great hungarian plain  in the south and east  including the eastern slovak lowland  and the little hungarian plain  in the northwest   divided by the transdanubian mountains the pannonian basin lies in the southeastern part of central europe  it forms a topographically discrete unit set in the european landscape  surrounded by imposing geographic boundaries -  the carpathian mountains and the alps  the rivers danube and tisza divide the basin roughly in half  it extends roughly between vienna in the northwest  zagreb in the southwest  belgrade in the southeast and satu mare in the northeast in terms of modern state boundaries  the basin centres on the territory of hungary  but it also covers vojvodina and regions of western slovakia  the eastern slovak lowland   southwestern ukraine  northern serbia  vojvodina   and the tip of northeast croatia  slavonia   the name  pannonian  comes from pannonia  a province of the roman empire  only the western part of the territory of modern hungary  the so-called  transdanubia  formed part of the ancient roman province of pannonia  this comprises less than 29%  of modern hungary  therefore hungarian geographers avoid the terms  pannonian basin  and  pannonian plain  in english  the terms  pannonian basin  and  carpathian basin  are used synonymously  the name  pannonian  is taken from that of pannonia  a province of the roman empire  the historical province overlapped but was not coterminous with the geographical plain or basin  pannonia inferior covered much of the western half of the basin  as far as the danube  pannonia superior included the western fringe of the basin as well as part of the eastern alps  as far as virunum  the southern fringe of the basin was in dalmatia and moesia  the eastern half of the basin was not conquered by the romans  and was considered part of sarmatia  inhabited by the iazyges  likewise  the parts north of the danube  now in western slovakia  were not in the empire  they were considered part of germania  inhabited by the quadi the term pannonian plain refers to the lowland parts of the pannonian basin as well as those of some adjoining regions like lower austria  moravia  bosnia  the lands adjoining the plain proper are sometimes also called peri-pannonian.the  term carpathian basin is used in hungarian literature  while the south slavic languages  slovak and german use pannonian  in hungarian  the basin is known as kárpát-medence,  in serbian and bosnian as панонски басен  panonski basen and panonska nizija  in croatian as panonska nizina  in slovak as panónska kotlina  in slovenian as panonska kotlina and in german as pannonisches becken  in romanian as câmpia panonică or bazinul panonic in hungarian geographical literature various subdivisions of the carpathian mountains  inner western carpathians  inner eastern carpathians  southern carpathians  western carpathians and transylvanian plateau  are also considered parts of the carpathian basin on the basis of traditional geopolitical divisions julius pokorny derived the name pannonia from illyrian  from the proto-indo-european  root *pen-,   swamp  water  wet   cf  english fen   marsh   hindi pani  rain is not plentiful  it usually falls when necessary and the plain is a major agricultural area  it is sometimes said that these fields of rich loamy loess soil could feed the whole of europe  for its early settlers  the plain offered few sources of metals or stone  thus when archaeologists come upon objects of obsidian or chert  copper or gold  they have almost unparalleled opportunities to interpret ancient pathways of trade the pannonian plain is divided into two parts along the transdanubian mountains  hungarian  dunántúli-középhegység).  the northwestern part is called western pannonian plain  or province  and the southeastern part eastern pannonian plain  or province   they comprise the following sections note  the transylvanian plateau and the lučenec-košice  depression  both parts of the carpathians  and some other lowlands are sometimes also considered part of the pannonian plain in non-geomorphological  or older divisions relatively large or distinctive areas of the plain that do not necessarily correspond to national borders include the pannonian basin has its geological origins in the pannonian sea  a shallow sea that reached its greatest extent during the pliocene epoch  when three to four kilometres of sediments were deposited the plain was named after the pannon named medes  various different peoples inhabited the plain during its history  in the first century bc  the eastern parts of the plain belonged to the dacian state  and in the first century ad its western parts were subsumed into the roman empire  the roman province named pannonia was established in the area  and the city of sirmium  today sremska mitrovica  serbia  became one of the four capital cities of the roman empire in the 3rd  century in the age of migrations and the early middle ages  the region belonged to several realms such as the hun empire  the kingdom of the gepids  the kingdom of the ostrogoths  the kingdom of the lombards  the avar khaganate  the slavic state of samo  the bulgarian empire  the frankish empire  the great moravia  the balaton principality  the pannonian principality and the kingdom of syrmia the principality of hungary established in 895  by the magyars was centered on the plain and included almost all of it  as did the former avar kingdom as well   it was established as the christian kingdom of hungary in ad 1000,  with the coronation of stephen i of hungary the kingdom of hungary by the 11th  century comprised the entire pannonian basin  but the changing fates of this part of europe during the ottoman wars of the 14th  to 17th  centuries left the pannonian basin divided between numerous political entities  after the battle of mohács in 1526,  the central and eastern regions of the kingdom and the plain on which they lay were incorporated into the ottoman empire  while the remainder to the north-west  was subsumed into the holdings of the habsburg monarchy and retitled royal hungary  under ottoman administration  the plain was reorganized into the eyalet of budim  the eyalet of egri  the eyalet of sigetvar  and the eyalet of temeşvar the pannonian plain was frequently a scene of conflict between the two empires  at the end of the 17th  century the habsburgs won decisive battles against the ottomans  and most of the plain gradually came under habsburg rule  under habsburg rule the region was eventually reorganized into the kingdom of hungary  the banat of temeswar  the military frontier  the kingdom of croatia  the kingdom of slavonia and voivodeship of serbia and temes banat the habsburg monarchy was subsequently transformed into the austrian empire  in 1804)  and later became austria-hungary   in 1867).  most of the plain was located within the hungarian part of austria-hungary,  since all other habsburg possessions in the plain were integrated into the kingdom of hungary until 1882.  the autonomous kingdom of croatia-slavonia,  which was one of the lands of the crown of st  stephen  comprised the south-western  portion of the plain with the dissolution of austria-hungary  after world war i  the region was divided between hungary  romania  czechoslovakia  austria  and the kingdom of serbs  croats and slovenes  renamed to yugoslavia in 1929).  the borders drawn in 1918  and 1919  are mostly preserved as those of the contemporary states of hungary  serbia  croatia  slovakia  romania and austria this is a list of cities in the pannonian basin with a population larger than
