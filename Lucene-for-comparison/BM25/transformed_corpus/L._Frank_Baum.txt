production of the rose lawn home journal  the brothers published several issues of the journal  which included advertisements  they may have sold needed   by the age of 17,  baum established a second amateur journal called the stamp collector  printed an 11-page  pamphlet called baum s complete stamp dealers  directory  and started a stamp dealership with 20,  baum took on the national craze of

during times of financial difficulties  his selling of fireworks made the fourth of july memorable  his skyrockets  roman candles  and fireworks filled the sky  while many people around the neighborhood would gather in front of the house to watch the displays  christmas was even more festive  baum dressed as santa claus for the family  his father would place the christmas tree behind a curtain in the front parlor so that baum could talk to everyone while he decorated the tree without people managing to see him  he maintained this tradition all his embarked on his lifetime infatuation—and wavering financial success—with the a local theatrical company duped him into replenishing their stock of costumes on the promise of leading roles coming his way  disillusioned  baum left the theater — temporarily — and went to work as a clerk in his brother-in-law's  dry goods company in syracuse  this experience may have influenced his story  the suicide of kiaros   first published in the literary journal the white elephant  a fellow clerk one day was found locked in a store room dead  probably from suicide baum could never stay away long from the stage  he performed in plays under the stage names of louis f  baum and george in 1880,  his father built him a theater in richburg  new york  and baum set about writing plays and gathering a company to act in them  the maid of arran proved a modest success  a melodrama with songs based on william black s novel a princess of thule  baum wrote the play and composed songs for it  making it a prototypical musical  as its songs relate to the narrative   and acted in the leading role  his aunt katharine gray played his character s aunt  she was the founder of syracuse oratory school  and baum advertised his services in her catalog to teach theater  including stage business  play writing  directing  translating  french  german  and italian   revision  and operettas on november 9,  1882,  baum married maud gage  a daughter of matilda joslyn gage  a famous women s suffrage and feminist activist  while baum was touring with the maid of arran  the theater in richburg caught fire during a production of baum s ironically titled parlor drama matches  destroying the theater as well as the only known copies of many of baum s scripts  including matches  as well as costumes in july 1888,  baum and his wife moved to aberdeen  dakota territory where he opened a store called  baum s bazaar   his habit of giving out wares on credit led to the eventual bankrupting of the so baum turned to editing the local newspaper the aberdeen saturday pioneer where he wrote the column our following the death of sitting bull at the hands of indian agency police  baum urged the wholesale extermination of all america s native peoples in a column that he wrote on december 20,  on january 3,  1891  he returned to the subject in an editorial response to the wounded knee pioneer has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extirmination of the indians  having wronged them for centuries  we had better  in order to protect our civilization  follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the recent analysis of these editorials has challenged their literal interpretation  suggesting that the actual intent of baum was to generate sympathy for the indians via obnoxious argument  ostensibly promoting the contrary description of kansas in the wonderful wizard of oz is based on his experiences in drought-ridden  south dakota  during much of this time  matilda joslyn gage was living in the baum household  while baum was in south dakota  he sang in a quartet which included james kyle  who became one of the first populist  people s party  senators in the newspaper failed in 1891,  and he  maud  and their four sons moved to the humboldt park section of chicago  where baum took a job reporting for the evening post  beginning in 1897,  he founded and edited a magazine called the show later known as the merchants record and show window  which focused on store window displays  retail strategies and visual merchandising  the major department stores of the time created elaborate christmastime fantasies  using clockwork mechanisms that made people and animals appear to move  the former show window magazine is still currently in operation  now known as vmsd  visual merchandising   store design   based in in 1900,  baum published a book about window displays in which he stressed the importance of mannequins in drawing he also had to work as a traveling 1897,  he wrote and published mother goose in prose  a collection of mother goose rhymes written as prose stories and illustrated by maxfield parrish  mother goose was a moderate success and allowed baum to quit his sales job  which had had a negative impact on his health   in 1899,  baum partnered with illustrator w w  denslow to publish father goose  his book  a collection of nonsense poetry  the book was a success  becoming the best-selling  children s book of the 1900,  baum and denslow  with whom he shared the copyright  published the wonderful wizard of oz to much critical acclaim and financial the book was the best-selling  children s book for two years after its initial publication  baum went on to write thirteen more novels based on the places and people of the land of oz two years after wizard s publication  baum and denslow teamed up with composer paul tietjens and director julian mitchell to produce a musical stage version of the book under fred r  baum and tietjens had worked on a musical of the wonderful wizard of oz in 1901  and based closely upon the book  but it was rejected  this stage version opened in chicago in 1902   the first to use the shortened title  the wizard of oz    then ran on broadway for 293  stage nights from january to october 1903.  it returned to broadway in 1904,  where it played from march to may and again from november to december  it successfully toured the united states with much of the same cast  as was done in those days  until 1911,  and then became available for amateur use  the stage version starred anna laughlin as dorothy gale  alongside david c  montgomery and fred stone as the tin woodman and scarecrow respectively  which shot the pair to instant fame the stage version differed quite a bit from the book  and was aimed primarily at adults  toto was replaced with imogene the cow  and tryxie tryfle  a waitress  and pastoria  a streetcar operator  were added as fellow cyclone victims  the wicked witch of the west was eliminated entirely in the script  and the plot became about how the four friends were allied with the usurping wizard and were hunted as traitors to pastoria ii  the rightful king of oz  it is unclear how much control or influence baum had on the script  it appears that many of the changes were written by baum against his wishes due to contractual requirements with hamlin  jokes in the script  mostly written by glen macdonough  called for explicit references to president theodore roosevelt  senator mark hanna  rev  andrew danquer  and oil magnate john d  rockefeller  although use of the script was rather free-form,  the line about hanna was ordered dropped as soon as hamlin got word of his death in 1904.beginning  with the success of the stage version  most subsequent versions of the story  including newer editions of the novel  have been titled  the wizard of oz   rather than using the full  original title  in more recent years  restoring the full title has become increasingly common  particularly to distinguish the novel from the hollywood film baum wrote a new oz book  the marvelous land of oz  with a view to making it into a stage production  which was titled the woggle-bug,  but montgomery and stone balked at appearing when the original was still running  the scarecrow and tin woodman were then omitted from this adaptation  which was seen as a self-rip-off  by critics and proved to be a major flop before it could reach broadway  he also worked for years on a musical version of ozma of oz  which eventually became the tik-tok  man of oz  this did fairly well in los angeles  but not well enough to convince producer oliver morosco to mount a production in new york  he also began a stage version of the patchwork girl of oz  but this was ultimately realized as a film with the success of wizard on page and stage  baum and denslow hoped for further success and published dot and tot of merryland in the book was one of baum s weakest  and its failure further strained his faltering relationship with denslow  it was their last collaboration  baum worked primarily with john r  neill on his fantasy work beginning in 1904,  but baum met neill few times  all before he moved to california  and often found neill s art not humorous enough for his liking  he was particularly offended when neill published the oz toy book  cut-outs  for the kiddies without authorization several times during the development of the oz series  baum declared that he had written his last oz book and devoted himself to other works of fantasy fiction based in other magical lands  including the life and adventures of santa claus and queen zixi of ix  however  he returned to the series each time  persuaded by popular demand  letters from children  and the failure of his new books  even so  his other works remained very popular after his death  with the master key appearing on st  nicholas magazine s survey of readers  favorite books well into the 1920s.in  1905,  baum declared plans for an oz amusement park  in an interview  he mentioned buying pedloe island off the coast of california to turn it into an oz park  however  there is no evidence that he purchased such an island  and no one has ever been able to find any island whose name even resembles pedloe in that nevertheless  baum stated to the press that he had discovered a pedloe island off the coast of california and that he had purchased it to be  the marvelous land of oz   intending it to be  a fairy paradise for children   eleven year old dorothy talbot of san francisco was reported to be ascendant to the throne on march 1,  1906,  when the palace of oz was expected to be completed  baum planned to live on the island  with administrative duties handled by the princess and her all-child  advisers  plans included statues of the scarecrow  tin woodman  jack pumpkinhead  and h m  woggle-bug,  baum abandoned his oz park project after the failure of the woggle-bug,  which was playing at the garrick theatre in 1905.because  of his lifelong love of theatre  he financed elaborate musicals  often to his financial detriment  one of baum s worst financial endeavors was his the fairylogue and radio-plays  (1908),  which combined a slideshow  film  and live actors with a lecture by baum as if he were giving a travelogue to however  baum ran into trouble and could not pay his debts to the company who produced the films  he did not get back to a stable financial situation for several years  after he sold the royalty rights to many of his earlier works  including the wonderful wizard of oz  this resulted in the m a  donahue company publishing cheap editions of his early works with advertising which purported that baum s newer output was inferior to the less expensive books that they were releasing  baum had shrewdly transferred most of his property into maud s name  except for his clothing  his typewriter  and his library  mostly of children s books  such as the fairy tales of andrew lang  whose portrait he kept in his study —all of which  he successfully argued  were essential to his occupation  maud handled the finances anyway  and thus baum lost much less than he could have baum made use of several pseudonyms for some of his other non-oz  books  they include baum also anonymously wrote the last egyptian  a romance of the nile  he continued theatrical work with harry marston haldeman s men s social group the for which he wrote several plays for various celebrations  he also wrote the group s parodic by-laws.  the group also included will rogers  but was proud to have had baum as a member and posthumously revived many of his works despite their ephemeral intent  many of these play s titles are known  but only the uplift of lucifer is known to survive  it was published in a limited edition in the 1960s).  prior to that  his last produced play was the tik-tok  man of oz  based on ozma of oz and the basis for tik-tok  of oz   a modest success in hollywood that producer oliver morosco decided did not do well enough to take to broadway  morosco  incidentally  quickly turned to film production  as did baum in 1914,  baum started his own film production company the oz film manufacturing which came as an outgrowth of the uplifters  he served as its president and principal producer and screenwriter  the rest of the board consisted of louis f  gottschalk  harry marston haldeman  and clarence r  rundel  the films were directed by j  farrell macdonald  with casts that included violet macmillan  vivian reed  mildred harris  juanita hansen  pierre couderc  mai welles  louise emmons  j  charles haydon  and early appearances by harold lloyd and hal roach  silent film actor richard rosson appeared in one of the films  whose younger brother harold rosson photographed the wizard of oz (1939).  after little success probing the unrealized children s film market  baum acknowledged his authorship of the last egyptian and made a film of it  portions of which are included in decasia   but the oz name had become box office poison for the time being  and even a name change to dramatic feature films and transfer of ownership to frank joslyn baum did not help  baum invested none of his own money in the venture  unlike the fairylogue and radio-plays,  but the stress probably took its toll on his health on may 5,  1919,  baum suffered a stroke  the following day he slipped into a coma but briefly awoke and spoke his last words to his wife   now we can cross the shifting sands   frank died on may 6,  he was buried in glendale s forest lawn memorial park final oz book  glinda of oz  was published on july 10,  1920,  a year after his death  the oz series was continued long after his death by other authors  notably ruth plumly thompson  who wrote an additional nineteen oz avowed intentions with the oz books and other fairy tales was to retell tales such as are found in the works of the brothers grimm and hans christian andersen  make them in an american vein  update them  avoid stereotypical characters such as dwarfs or genies  and remove the association of violence and moral the first books contained a fair amount of violence  but it decreased with the series  in the emerald city of oz  ozma objected to doing violence even to the nomes who threaten oz with his introduction is often cited as the beginnings of the sanitization of children s stories  although he did not do a great deal more than eliminate harsh moral lessons another traditional element that baum intentionally omitted was the emphasis on romance  he considered romantic love to be uninteresting for young children  as well as largely incomprehensible  in the wonderful wizard of oz  the only element of romance lay in the background of the tin woodman and his love for nimmie amee  which explains his condition and does not otherwise affect the tale  and that of gayelette and the enchantment of the winged monkeys  the only other stories with such elements were the scarecrow of oz and tik-tok  of oz  both based on dramatizations  which baum regarded warily until his readers accepted roesch wagner of the matilda joslyn gage foundation has published a pamphlet titled the wonderful mother of oz describing how matilda gage s feminist politics were sympathetically channeled by baum into his oz books  much of the politics in the republican aberdeen saturday pioneer dealt with trying to convince the populace to vote for women s suffrage  baum was the secretary of aberdeen s woman s suffrage club  susan b  anthony visited aberdeen and stayed with the baums  nancy tystad koupal notes an apparent loss of interest in editorializing after aberdeen failed to pass the bill for women s enfranchisement some of baum s contacts with suffragists of his day seem to have inspired much of his second oz story the marvelous land of oz  in this story  general jinjur leads the girls and women of oz in a revolt  armed with knitting needles  they succeed and make the men do the household chores  jinjur proves to be an incompetent ruler  but a female advocating gender equality is ultimately placed on the throne  his edith van dyne stories depict girls and young women engaging in traditionally masculine activities  including the aunt jane s nieces  the flying girl and its sequel  and his girl sleuth josie o gorman from the bluebird books during the period surrounding the 1890  ghost dance movement and wounded knee massacre  baum wrote two editorials about native americans for the aberdeen saturday pioneer which have provoked controversy in recent times because of his assertion that the safety of white settlers depended on the wholesale genocide of american indians  sociologist robert venables has argued that baum was not using sarcasm in the first piece was published on december 20,  1890,  five days after the killing of the lakota sioux holy man  sitting bull  who was being held in custody at the time   following is the complete text of the editorial baum wrote a second editorial following the december 29,  1890  massacre and published on january 3,  1891:these  two short editorials continue to haunt his legacy  in 2006,  two descendants of baum apologized to the sioux nation for any hurt that their ancestor had short story  the enchanted buffalo  claims to be a legend of a tribe of bison  and states that a key element made it into legends of native american tribes  father goose  his book contains poems such as  there was a little nigger boy  and "lee-hi-lung-whan."  in the last egyptian  lord roane uses  nigger  to insult the title character  while in the daring twins  set in the american south  the only character to use the term is a boy from boston complaining that his mother uses their money to help  naked niggers in africa   baum mentions his characters  distaste for a hopi snake dance in aunt jane s nieces and uncle john  but also deplores the horrible situation of indian reservations  aunt jane s nieces on the ranch has a hard-working  mexican present himself as an exception to reiterate anglo stereotypes of mexican needed  baum s mother-in-law  and woman s suffrage leader matilda joslyn gage had great influence over baum s views  gage was initiated into the wolf clan and admitted into the iroquois council of matrons for her outspoken respect and sympathy for native american people  it would seem unlikely that baum could have harbored animosity for them in his mature political references to the  wizard  appeared early in the 20th  century  henry littlefield  an upstate new york high school history teacher  wrote a scholarly article which was the first full-fledged  interpretation of the novel as an extended political allegory of the politics and characters of the special attention was paid to the populist metaphors and debates over silver and baum was a republican and avid supporter of women s suffrage  and it is thought that he personally did not support the political ideals of either the populist movement of 1890–92  or the bryanite-silver  crusade of 1896–1900.  he published a poem in support of william 1964,  many scholars  economists  and historians have expanded on littlefield s interpretation  pointing to multiple similarities between the characters  especially as depicted in denslow s illustrations  and stock figures from editorial cartoons of the period  littlefield himself wrote to the new york times letters to the editor section spelling out that his theory had no basis in fact  but that his original point was  not to label baum  or to lessen any of his magic  but rather  as a history teacher at mount vernon high school  to invest turn-of-the-century  america with the imagery and wonder i have always found in his newspaper had addressed politics in the 1890s,  and denslow was an editorial cartoonist as well as an illustrator of children s books  a series of political references is included in the 1902  stage version  such as references by name to the president  to a powerful senator  and to john d  rockefeller for providing the oil needed by the tin woodman  scholars have found few political references in baum s oz books after 1902.baum  himself was asked whether his stories had hidden meanings  but he always replied that they were written to  please was originally a methodist  but he joined the episcopal church in aberdeen to participate in community theatricals  later  he and his wife were encouraged by matilda joslyn gage to become members of the theosophical society in baum s beliefs are often reflected in his writing  the only mention of a church in his oz books is the porcelain one which the cowardly lion breaks in the dainty china country in the wonderful wizard of oz  the baums sent their older sons to  ethical culture sunday school  in chicago  which taught morality  not
