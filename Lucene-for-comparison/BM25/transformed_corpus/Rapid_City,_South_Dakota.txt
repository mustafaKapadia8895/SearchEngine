 rapid city  south dakota -  wikipediarapid city  lakota  mni lúzahaŋ  swift water city   is the second most populous city in south dakota  after sioux falls  and the county seat of pennington named after rapid creek  on which the city is established  it is set against the eastern slope of the black hills mountain range  the population was 67,956  as of the 2010  known as the  gateway to the black hills  and the  city of presidents   it is split by a low mountain ridge that divides the western and eastern parts of the city  ellsworth air force base is located on the outskirts of the city  camp rapid  a part of the south dakota army national guard  is located in the western part of the city  the historic  old west  town of deadwood is nearby  in the neighboring black hills are the popular tourist attractions of mount rushmore  the crazy horse memorial  custer state park  and wind cave national park the public discovery of gold in 1874  by the black hills expedition brought a mass influx of settlers into the black hills region of south dakota  rapid city was founded  and originally known as  hay camp   in 1876  by a group of disappointed miners  who promoted their new city as the  gateway to the black hills   john richard brennan and samuel scott  with a small group of men  laid out the site of the present rapid city in february 1876,  which was named for the spring-fed  rapid creek that flows through it  a square mile was measured off and the six blocks in the center were designated as a business section  committees were appointed to bring in prospective merchants and their families to locate in the new settlement  the city soon began selling supplies to miners and pioneers  its location on the edge of the plains and hills and its large river valley made it the natural hub of railroads arriving in the late 1880s  from both the south and east  by 1900,  rapid city had survived a boom and bust and was establishing itself as an important regional trade center for the upper midwest although the black hills became a popular tourist destination in the late 1890s,  it was a combination of local efforts  the popularity of the automobile  and construction of improved highways that brought tourists to the black hills in large numbers after world war i  gutzon borglum  already a famous sculptor  began work on mount rushmore in 1927  and his son  lincoln borglum  continued the carving of the presidents  faces in rock following his father s death in 1941.  the work was halted due to pressures leading to the us entry into world war ii and the massive sculpture was declared complete in 1941.  although tourism sustained the city throughout the great depression of the 1930s,  the gasoline rationing of world war ii had a devastating effect on the tourist industry in the town  but this was more than made up for by the war-related  growth the city benefited greatly from the opening of rapid city army air base  later ellsworth air force base  an army air corps training base  as a result  the population of the area nearly doubled between 1940  and 1948,  from almost 14,000  to nearly 27,000  people  military families and civilian personnel soon took every available living space in town  and mobile home parks proliferated  rapid city businesses profited from the military payroll  during the cold war  missile installations proliferated in the area  a series of nike air defense sites were constructed around ellsworth in the 1950s.  in the early 60s  the construction of three titan missile launch sites containing a total of nine titan i missiles in the general vicinity of rapid city took place  beginning in november 1963,  the land for a hundred miles east  northeast and northwest of the city was dotted with 150  minuteman missile silos and 15  launch command centers  all of which were deactivated in the early 1949,  city officials envisioned the city as a retail and wholesale trade center for the region and designed a plan for growth that focused on a civic center  more downtown parking places  new schools  and paved streets  a construction boom continued into the 1950s.  growth slowed in the 1960s,  but the worst natural disaster in south dakota history  the black hills flood  led to another building boom a decade later  on june 9,  1972,  heavy rains caused massive flooding of the rapid creek  more than 250  people lost their lives and more than $100  million in property was destroyed the devastation of the flood and the outpouring of private donations and millions of dollars in federal aid led to the completion of one big part of the 1979  plan  clearing the area along the rapid creek and making it a public park  new homes and businesses were constructed to replace those that had been destroyed  rushmore plaza civic center and a new central high school were built in part of the area that had been cleared  the new central high school opened in 1978,  with the graduating class in that year straddling both the original central  housed in what is now rapid city high school and community theater  and the new central  the rebuilding in part insulated rapid city from the drop in automotive tourism caused by the oil embargo in 1974,  but tourism was depressed for most of a decade  in 1978,  rushmore mall was built on the north edge of the city  adding to the city s position as a retail shopping center in 1980  in united states v  sioux nation of indians  the supreme court of the united states ruled that the federal government of the united states had illegally stolen the black hills from the sioux people when the government unilaterally broke the treaty that guaranteed the black hills belonged to the sioux  the court decision offered money  but the sioux declined on principle that the theft of their land should not be validated  and still demand the return of the this land includes rapid city  which is by far the largest modern settlement in the black hills  as of 2010,  the dispute has not been settled in the 1980s,  growth was fueled by an increase in tourism  increasingly tied to the sturgis motorcycle rally  followed by another decline in the late 1990s.  fears for the closure of ellsworth afb as part of the massive base closure process in the 1990s  and 2000s  led to attempts to expand other sectors of the economy  but growth continued and the city expanded significantly during this period today  rapid city is south dakota s primary city for tourism and recreation  with the approval of a deep underground science and engineering laboratory at the homestake mine site in nearby lead  rapid city has a future of great advancements in technology  medicine  and scientific research on june 9–10,  1972,  extremely heavy rains over the eastern black hills of south dakota produced record floods on rapid creek and other streams in the area  nearly 15  inches (380  mm  of rain fell in about 6  hours near nemo  and more than 10  inches (250  mm  of rain fell over an area of 60  square miles (160  km2).  according to the red cross  the resulting peak floods  which occurred after dark  left 238  people dead and 3,057  people in addition to the human tragedy  total destruction was estimated in excess of $160  million  about $821  million in 2009  dollars   which included 1,335  homes and 5,000  automobiles that were destroyed  runoff from this storm produced record floods  highest peak flows recorded  along battle  spring  rapid  and box elder creeks  smaller floods also occurred along elk creek and bear butte creek  canyon lake dam  on the west side of rapid city  broke the night of the flood  unleashing a wall of water down the creek  the 1972  flooding has an estimated recurrence interval of 500  which means that a flood of this magnitude will occur on average once every 500  years  every year there is a 0.2  percent chance (1  in 500)  of experiencing a similar event  to prevent a similar tragedy from occurring in the future  the city s flood plain is no longer allowed to be built upon  today the flood plain features golf courses  parks  sports arenas  and arboretums where neighborhoods and businesses once stood in 2007,  the rapid city public library created a 1972  flood digital that collects survivors  stories  photos and news accounts of the flood  the journey museum has an interactive display on the 1972  flood  which is an ongoing project to give future generations the best idea of how the people were affected and the changes made to it because of the loss of 238  lives  it will in the future include

central location allows easy transport of products to both coasts  and trucking is a major business activity in the city  improved connections with denver and i-80  to the south  via the heartland expressway now under construction will primarily benefit local trucking rapid city s location on the boundary of the western and eastern power grids  together with the hydroelectric plants of the mainstem dams on the missouri river and the large coal fields and power plants of the powder river basin of wyoming make it one of the points where the two national power grids connect with each other  allowing switching of electrical power from east to west and vice versa  rapid city previously had its own coal-fired  power plant before federal regulations forced it and many other coal plants in the area such as power stations near gillette  wyoming  to shut down  the ben french power station located within city boundaries shut down september 2012,  more than 2  years ahead of its scheduled shut down  rapid city now obtains much of its power from both the missouri dams and importing it from elsewhere  electrical rates used to be considered relatively low until the shut down of the coal plants  so have progressively climbed the last several years as a lack of local power sources means massive expenses to import it from greater distances rapid city obtains most of its water supply from rapid creek and the alluvial aquifers associated with the creek  owning significant water rights in pactola reservoir located some 15  miles (24  km  west of the city  but does also obtain water from some springs in the vicinity  and has the ability to draw water from deep formations that receive water from recharge in areas of the black hills where the formations come to the surface  the heavy dependence on shallow alluvial aquifers is of some concern to planners  as most suburbs of rapid city use septic systems for domestic sewage treatment  however  water supplies remain relatively good for future growth rapid city has limited city-to-city  bus service along i-90,  but many charter bus services operate in the area  and connect rapid city and deadwood with cities in colorado
