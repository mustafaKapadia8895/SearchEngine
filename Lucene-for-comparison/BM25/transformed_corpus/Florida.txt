established a settlement at present-day  pensacola  making it the first attempted settlement in florida  but it was mostly abandoned by 1561.in  1565,  the settlement of st  augustine  san agustín  was established under the leadership of admiral and governor pedro menéndez de avilés  creating what would become the oldest european settlement in the continental u s  and establishing the first generation of floridanos and the government of spain maintained tenuous control over the region by converting the local tribes to christianity the geographical area of florida diminished with the establishment of english settlements to the north and french claims to the west  the english attacked st  augustine  burning the city and its cathedral to the ground several times  spain built the castillo de san marcos in 1672  and fort matanzas in 1742  to defend florida s capital city from attacks  and to maintain its strategic position in the defense of the captaincy general of cuba and the spanish west indies florida attracted numerous africans and african-americans  from adjacent british colonies who sought freedom from slavery  in 1738,  governor manuel de montiano established fort gracia real de santa teresa de mose near st  augustine  a fortified town for escaped slaves to whom montiano granted citizenship and freedom in return for their service in the florida militia  and which became the first free black settlement legally sanctioned in north 1763,  spain traded florida to the kingdom of great britain for control of havana  cuba  which had been captured by the british during the seven years  war  it was part of a large expansion of british territory following their victory in the seven years  war  a large portion of the floridano population left  taking along most of the remaining indigenous population to the british soon constructed the king s road connecting st  augustine to georgia  the road crossed the st  johns river at a narrow point  which the seminole called wacca pilatka and the british named  cow ford   both names ostensibly reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river british divided and consolidated the florida provinces  las floridas  into east florida and west florida  a division the spanish government kept after the brief british the british government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the french and indian war in order to encourage settlement  in order to induce settlers to move to florida  reports of its natural wealth were published in england  a large number of british settlers who were described as being  energetic and of good character  moved to florida  mostly coming from south carolina  georgia and england  there was also a group of settlers who came from the colony of bermuda  this would be the first permanent english-speaking  population in what is now duval county  baker county  st  johns county and nassau county  the british built good public roads and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane  indigo and fruits as well the export of a result of these initiatives northeastern florida prospered economically in a way it never did under spanish administration  furthermore  the british governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the floridas and in the meantime they were  with the advice of councils  to establish courts  this would be the first introduction of much of the english-derived  legal system which florida still has today including trial by jury  habeas corpus and county-based

1821.defense  of florida s northern border with the united states was minor during the second spanish period  the region became a haven for escaped slaves and a base for indian attacks against u s  territories  and the u s  pressed spain for reform americans of english descent and americans of scots-irish  descent began moving into northern florida from the backwoods of georgia and south carolina  though technically not allowed by the spanish authorities and the floridan government  they were never able to effectively police the border region and the backwoods settlers from the united states would continue to immigrate into florida unchecked  these migrants  mixing with the already present british settlers who had remained in florida since the british period  would be the progenitors of the population known as florida american settlers established a permanent foothold in the area and ignored spanish authorities  the british settlers who had remained also resented spanish rule  leading to a rebellion in 1810  and the establishment for ninety days of the so-called  free and independent republic of west florida on september 23.  after meetings beginning in june  rebels overcame the garrison at baton rouge  now in louisiana   and unfurled the flag of the new republic  a single white star on a blue field  this flag would later become known as the  bonnie blue flag  in 1810,  parts of west florida were annexed by proclamation of president james madison  who claimed the region as part of the louisiana purchase  these parts were incorporated into the newly formed territory of orleans  the u s  annexed the mobile district of west florida to the mississippi territory in 1812.  spain continued to dispute the area  though the united states gradually increased the area it occupied  in 1812,  a group of settlers from georgia  with de facto support from the u s  federal government  attempted to overthrow the floridan government in the province of east florida  the settlers hoped to convince floridans to join their cause and proclaim independence from spain  but the settlers lost their tenuous support from the federal government and abandoned their cause by based in east florida began raiding georgia settlements  and offering havens for runaway slaves  the united states army led increasingly frequent incursions into spanish territory  including the 1817–1818  campaign against the seminole indians by andrew jackson that became known as the first seminole war  the united states now effectively controlled east florida  control was necessary according to secretary of state john quincy adams because florida had become  a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy  civilized or savage  of the united states  and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to had become a burden to spain  which could not afford to send settlers or garrisons  madrid therefore decided to cede the territory to the united states through the adams-onís  treaty  which took effect in president james monroe was authorized on march 3,  1821  to take possession of east florida and west florida for the united states and provide for initial andrew jackson  on behalf of the u s  federal government  served as a military commissioner with the powers of governor of the newly acquired territory for a brief on march 30,  1822,  the u s  congress merged east florida and part of west florida into the florida the early 1800s,  indian removal was a significant issue throughout the southeastern u s  and also in florida  in 1830,  the u s  congress passed the indian removal act and as settlement increased  pressure grew on the united states government to remove the indians from florida  seminoles harbored runaway blacks  known as the black seminoles  and clashes between whites and indians grew with the influx of new settlers  in 1832,  the treaty of payne s landing promised to the seminoles lands west of the mississippi river if they agreed to leave florida  many seminole left at this time some seminoles remained  and the u s  army arrived in florida  leading to the second seminole war (1835–1842).  following the war  approximately 3,000  seminole and 800  black seminole were removed to indian territory  a few hundred seminole remained in florida in the everglades on march 3,  1845,  florida became the 27th  state to join the united states of the state was admitted as a slave state and ceased to be a sanctuary for runaway slaves  initially its population grew slowly as european settlers continued to encroach on seminole lands  and the united states intervened to move the remaining seminoles to the west  the third seminole war (1855–58)  resulted in the forced removal of most of the remaining seminoles  although hundreds of seminole indians remained in the settlers began to establish cotton plantations in north florida  which required numerous laborers  which they supplied by buying slaves in the domestic market  by 1860,  florida had only 140,424  people  of whom 44%  were enslaved  there were fewer than 1,000  free african americans before the american civil january 1861,  nearly all delegates in the florida legislature approved an ordinance of secession  declaring florida to be  a sovereign and independent nation —an apparent reassertion to the preamble in florida s constitution of 1838,  in which florida agreed with congress to be a  free and independent state   although not directly related to the issue of slavery  the ordinance declared florida s secession from the union  allowing it to become one of the founding members of the confederate states  a looser union of states the confederal union received little help from florida  the 15,000  men it offered were generally sent elsewhere  the largest engagements in the state were the battle of olustee  on february 20,  1864,  and the battle of natural bridge  on march 6,  1865.  both were confederate the war ended in 1865.following  the american civil war  florida s congressional representation was restored on june 25,  1868,  albeit forcefully after radical reconstruction and the installation of unelected government officials under the final authority of federal military commanders  after the reconstruction period ended in 1876,  white democrats regained power in the state legislature  in 1885  they created a new constitution  followed by statutes through 1889  that disfranchised most blacks and many poor needed until the mid-20th  century  florida was the least populous southern state  in 1900,  its population was only 528,542,  of whom nearly 44%  were african american  the same proportion as before the civil the boll weevil devastated cotton crops forty thousand blacks  roughly one-fifth  of their 1900  population  left the state in the great migration  they left due to lynchings and racial violence  and for better disfranchisement for most african americans in the state persisted until the civil rights movement of the 1960s  gained federal legislation in 1965  to enforce protection of their constitutional suffrage historically  florida s economy has been based primarily upon agricultural products such as cattle  sugar cane  citrus fruits  tomatoes  and strawberries economic prosperity in the 1920s  stimulated tourism to florida and related development of hotels and resort communities  combined with its sudden elevation in profile was the florida land boom of the 1920s,  which brought a brief period of intense land development  devastating hurricanes in 1926  and 1928,  followed by the great depression  brought that period to a halt  florida s economy did not fully recover until the military buildup for world war ii in 1939,  florida was described as “still very largely an empty subsequently  the growing availability of air conditioning  the climate  and a low cost of living made the state a haven  migration from the rust belt and the northeast sharply increased florida s population after 1945.  in recent decades  more migrants have come for the jobs in a developing economy with a population of more than 18  million according to the 2010  census
