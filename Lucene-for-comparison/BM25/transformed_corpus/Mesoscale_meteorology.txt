 mesoscale meteorology -  wikipediamesoscale meteorology is the study of weather systems smaller than synoptic scale systems but larger than microscale and storm-scale  cumulus systems  horizontal dimensions generally range from around 5  kilometers to several hundred kilometers  examples of mesoscale weather systems are sea breezes  squall lines  and mesoscale convective complexes vertical velocity often equals or exceeds horizontal velocities in mesoscale meteorological systems due to nonhydrostatic processes such as buoyant acceleration of a rising thermal or acceleration through a narrow mountain pass mesoscale meteorology is divided into these a note  tropical and subtropical cyclones are classified by national hurricane center as synoptic scale rather than in synoptic frontal analysis  mesoscale analysis uses cold  warm  and occluded fronts on the mesoscale to help describe phenomena  on weather maps mesoscale fronts are depicted as smaller and with twice as many bumps or spikes as the synoptic variety  in the united states  opposition to the use of the mesoscale versions of fronts on weather analyses  has led to the use of an overarching symbol  a trough symbol  with a label of outflow boundary as the frontal
