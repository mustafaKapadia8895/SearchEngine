 great red spot -  wikipediathe great red spot is a persistent zone of high pressure  producing an anticyclonic storm on the planet jupiter  22°  south of the equator  it has been continuously observed for 187  years  since 1830.  earlier observations from 1665  to 1713  are believed to be the same storm  if this is correct  it has existed for at least 350  storms such as this are not uncommon within the turbulent atmospheres of gas giants the great red spot may have existed since before 1665,  but the present spot was first seen only after 1830  and well-studied  only after a prominent apparition in 1879.  a long gap separates its period of current study after 1830  from its seventeenth-century  discovery  whether the original spot dissipated and reformed  whether it faded  or even if the observational record was simply poor  are all example  its first sighting is often credited to robert hooke  who described a spot on the planet in may 1664;  however  it is likely that hooke s spot was in the wrong belt altogether  the north equatorial belt  versus the current great red spot s location in the south equatorial belt   much more convincing is giovanni cassini s description of a  permanent spot  the following with fluctuations in visibility  cassini s spot was observed from 1665  to 1713;  however  the 118-year  observational gap makes the identity of the two spots inconclusive  and the older spot s shorter observational history and slower motion than the modern spot make their identity minor mystery concerns a jovian spot depicted in a 1711  canvas by donato creti  which is exhibited in the part of a series of panels in which different  magnified  heavenly bodies serve as backdrops for various italian scenes  and all overseen by the astronomer eustachio manfredi for accuracy  creti s painting is the first known to depict the great red spot as red  no jovian feature was explicitly described as red before the late february 25,  when the voyager 1  spacecraft was 9.2  million kilometres (5.7  million miles  from jupiter it transmitted the first detailed image of the great red spot back to earth  cloud details as small as 160  kilometres (100  miles  across were visible  the colorful  wavy cloud pattern seen to the left  west  of the red spot is a region of extraordinarily complex and variable wave motion at the start of 2004,  the great red spot had approximately half the longitudinal extent it had a century ago  when it reached a size of 40,000  kilometres  at the present rate of reduction it would become circular by 2040.  it is not known how long the spot will last  or whether the change is a result of normal smaller spot  designated oval ba  formed recently  march 2000)  from the merger of three white has turned reddish in color  astronomers have named it the little red spot or red  jr  as of june 5,  2006,  the great red spot and oval ba appeared to be approaching the storms pass each other about every two years but the passings of 2002  and 2004  were of little significance  amy simon-miller,  of the goddard space flight center  predicted the storms would have their closest passing on july 4,  2006.  she worked with imke de pater and phil marcus of uc berkeley  and a team of professional astronomers since april 2006  to study the storms using the hubble space telescope  on july 20,  the two storms were photographed passing each other by the gemini observatory without in may 2008  a third storm turned great red spot should not be confused with the great dark spot  a feature observed near the northern pole of jupiter in 2000  with the cassini–huygens note that a feature in the atmosphere of neptune was also called the great dark spot  the latter feature was imaged by voyager 2  in 1989,  and may have been an atmospheric hole rather than a storm and it was no longer present as of 1994   although a similar spot had appeared farther to the north  nasa s juno spacecraft flew over the great red spot on july 11,  2017,  taking several images of the spot from about 5,000  miles (8,000  km  above the oval object rotates counter-clockwise,  with a period of about six earth or fourteen jovian days  measuring in at 10,159  miles (16,350  kilometers  in width  as of april 3,  2017)  jupiter s great red spot is 1.3  times as wide as the cloud-tops  of this storm are about eight kilometres above the surrounding cloud-tops.infrared  data have long indicated that the great red spot is colder  and thus  higher in altitude  than most of the other clouds on the however  recent infrared measurements of the upper atmosphere show far more heat above the great red spot than the rest of the planet   acoustic waves  rising from the storm have been proposed as an explanation for jupiter s tracking of atmospheric features revealed the spot s counter-clockwise  circulation as far back as 1966,  observations dramatically confirmed by the first time-lapse  movies from the voyager the spot is confined by a modest eastward jet stream to its south and a very strong westward one to its though winds around the edge of the spot peak at ~120  metres per second (432  kilometres per hour   currents inside it seem stagnant  with little inflow or the rotation period of the spot has decreased with time  perhaps as a direct result of its steady reduction in great red spot s latitude has been stable for the duration of good observational records  typically varying by about a degree  its longitude  however  is subject to constant because jupiter does not rotate uniformly at all latitudes  astronomers have defined three different systems for defining the longitude  system ii is used for latitudes of more than 10°,  and was originally based on the average rotation rate of the great red spot of 9h  55m  despite this  however  the spot has  lapped  the planet in system ii at least 10  times since the early nineteenth century  its drift rate has changed dramatically over the years and has been linked to the brightness of the south equatorial belt  and the presence or absence of a south tropical is not known exactly what causes the great red spot s reddish color  theories supported by laboratory experiments suppose that the color may be caused by complex organic molecules  red phosphorus  or a compound containing sulphur  but a consensus has yet to be needed the great red spot varies greatly in hue  from almost brick-red  to pale salmon  or even white  in fact  the spot occasionally  disappears   becoming evident only through the red spot hollow  which is its niche in the south equatorial belt  seb   interestingly  its visibility is apparently coupled to the seb  when the belt is bright white  the spot tends to be dark  and when it is dark  the spot is usually light  these periods when the spot is dark or light occur at irregular intervals  as of 1997,  during the preceding 50  years  the spot was darkest in the periods 1961–1966,  1968–1975,  1989–1990,  and is no definitive theory as to what is causing the formation or colour of the storm that is known as the great red spot  laboratory studies are examining the effects that cosmic rays or uv light from the sun are having on the chemical composition of the clouds of jupiter  in particular whether the sun s radiation is reacting with ammonium hydrosulfide in the planet s outer atmosphere to create the deep red research has shown that the storm produces extreme amounts of heat because it is simultaneously generating gravity and acoustic waves  when these turbulent energy waves collide 500  mi (800  km  above the red spot  they are creating extremely high temperatures in the planet s upper atmosphere  the effect is described as being like  crashing ocean waves on a the reason the storm has continued to exist for centuries is because of the physical nature of jupiter  as there is no planetary surface to provide friction  only a liquid core of hydrogen   circulating gas eddies persist for a very long time in the atmosphere because there is nothing to oppose their angular
