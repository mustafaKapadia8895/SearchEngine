 gioachino rossini -  wikipediagioachino antonio  italian  anˈtɔːnjo rosˈsiːni   29  february 1792  – 13  november 1868)  was an italian composer who wrote 39  operas  as well as some sacred music  songs  chamber music and piano pieces a precocious composer of operas  he made his full debut at the age of eighteen  with la cambiale di matrimonio   his best-known  operas include the italian comedies il barbiere di siviglia  the barber of seville   l italiana in algeri  the italian girl in algiers  and la cenerentola  cinderella   he also wrote a string of serious operas in italian  including works such as tancredi  otello and semiramide  the semi-serious  opera la gazza ladra  the thieving magpie  has one of rossini s most celebrated overtures  after moving to paris in 1824,  he eventually started to write in french  his last opera  the epic guillaume tell  william tell   replete with its iconic overture  helped usher in grand opera in france after composing thirty-nine  significant operas in nineteen years rossini retired from the theatre in 1829.  later  he was affected by both physical and mental illnesses and for decades wrote relatively little apart from a setting of the stabat mater  a return to paris from italy in 1855  was followed by better health and the provision of exclusive musical and culinary soirées  during these  he presented salon music in the form of songs  piano pieces and small chamber ensembles that he called  sins of old age   he considered the last of these  sins  to be the unusually scored petite messe solennelle  little solemn mass  that he wrote in 1863.rossini  had been the most popular opera composer in and he was one of the most renowned public figures of his a rapid and prolific composer  he was quoted as joking   give me the laundress  bill and i will even set that to a tendency for inspired  song-like  melodies is evident throughout his scores  earning him the nickname  the italian use of an exciting buildup of orchestral sound over a repeated phrase—commonly known as a  rossini crescendo —also prompted the nickname  signor crescendo  gioachino antonio rossini was born into a family of musicians in pesaro  a town on the adriatic coast of italy that was then part of the papal states  his father  giuseppe  was a horn player and inspector of slaughterhouses  his mother  anna  was a singer and a baker s daughter rossini s father was sympathetic to the french revolution and welcomed napoleon s troops when they arrived in northern italy  when austria restored the old regime  rossini s father was sent to prison in 1799,  where he remained until june rossini s mother took him to bologna  making a living as leading singer at various theatres of the romagna region  her husband would ultimately join her in bologna  during this time  rossini was frequently left in the care of his aging grandmother  who had difficulty supervising the boy he remained at bologna in the care of a pork butcher while his father played the horn in the orchestras of the theatres at which his wife sang  the boy had three years of instruction in the playing of the harpsichord from giuseppe prinetti  originally from novara  who played the scale with two fingers only  prinetti also owned a business selling beer and had a propensity to fall asleep while standing  these qualities made him a subject for ridicule in the eyes of the young was eventually taken from prinetti and apprenticed to a blacksmith  in angelo tesei  he found a congenial music master  and learned to sight-read,  play accompaniments on the piano and sing well enough to take solo parts in the church when he was ten years of age  important products of this period are six sonate a quattro  or string sonatas  composed in three days  unusually scored for two violins  cello and double bass  the original scores  dating from 1804  when the composer was twelve  were found in the library of congress in washington d c  often transcribed for string orchestra  these sonatas reveal the young composer s affinity for haydn and mozart  already showing signs of operatic tendencies  punctuated by frequent rhythmic changes and dominated by clear  songlike melodies in 1805,  he appeared at the theatre of the commune in ferdinando paer s camilla  his only public appearance as a singer  he was also a capable horn player  treading in the footsteps of his father  around this time  he composed individual numbers to a libretto by vincenza mombelli called demetrio e polibio  which was handed to the boy in pieces  though it was rossini s first opera  written when he was thirteen or fourteen  the work was not staged until the composer was twenty years old  premiering as his sixth official opera in 1806,  rossini became a cello student under cavedagni at the conservatorio di bologna  the following year he was admitted to the counterpoint class of padre stanislao mattei (1750–1825).  he learned to play the cello with ease  but the pedantic severity of mattei s views on counterpoint served only to drive the young composer s views toward a freer school of composition  his insight into orchestral resources is generally ascribed not to the strict compositional rules that he learned from mattei  but to knowledge gained independently while scoring the quartets and symphonies of haydn and mozart  at bologna  he was known as  il tedeschino    the little german   on account of his devotion to mozart through the friendly interposition of the marquis cavalli  his first opera  la cambiale di matrimonio  the marriage contract   was produced at venice when he was a youth of 18  years  two years before this he had already received the prize at the conservatorio of bologna for his cantata il pianto d armonia sulla morte d orfeo  between 1810  and 1813  at bologna  rome  venice and milan  rossini produced operas of varying success  most notably la pietra del paragone and il signor bruschino  with its brilliant and unique overture  in 1813,  tancredi and l italiana in algeri were even bigger successes  and catapulted the 20-year-old  composer to international fame the libretto for tancredi was an arrangement by gaetano rossi of voltaire s tragedy tancrède  traces of ferdinando paer and giovanni paisiello were undeniably present in fragments of the music  but any critical feeling on the part of the public was drowned by appreciation of such melodies as  di tanti palpiti    mi rivedrai  ti rivedrò   which became so popular that the italians would sing it in crowds at the law courts until called upon by the judge to desist by the age of 21,  rossini had established himself as the idol of the italian opera public  he continued to write operas for venice and milan during the next few years  but their reception was tame and in some cases unsatisfactory after the success of tancredi  in 1815  he retired to his home in bologna  where domenico barbaia  the impresario of the naples theatre  contracted an agreement that made him musical director of the teatro di san carlo and the teatro del fondo at naples  he would compose one opera a year for each  his payment was to be 200  ducats per month  he was also to receive a share from the gambling tables set in the theatre s  ridotto   amounting to about 1000  ducats per annum  this was an extraordinarily lucrative arrangement for any professional musician at that time he visited the naples conservatory  and  although less than four years senior to mercadante  he said to the director niccolò zingarelli   my compliments maestro—your young pupil mercadante begins where we older composers in naples  notably zingarelli and paisiello  were inclined to intrigue against the success of the youthful composer  but all hostility was rendered futile by the enthusiasm that greeted the court performance of his elisabetta  regina d inghilterra  in which isabella colbran  who subsequently became the composer s wife  took a leading part  the libretto of this opera by giovanni schmidt was in many of its incidents an anticipation of those presented to the world a few years later in sir walter scott s kenilworth  the opera was the first in which rossini wrote out the ornaments of the arias instead of leaving them to the fancy of the singers  and also the first in which the recitativo secco was replaced by a recitative accompanied by a string quartet rossini s most famous opera was produced on 20  february 1816,  at the teatro argentina in rome  the libretto  a version of pierre beaumarchais  stage play le barbier de séville  was newly written by cesare sterbini and not the same as that already used by giovanni paisiello in his own barbiere  an opera which had enjoyed european popularity for more than a quarter of a century  much is made of how quickly rossini s opera was written  scholarship generally agreeing upon two or three weeks  later in life  rossini claimed to have written the opera in only twelve days  it was a colossal failure when it premiered as almaviva  paisiello s admirers were extremely indignant  sabotaging the production by whistling and shouting during the entire first act  however  not long after the second performance  the opera became so successful that the fame of paisiello s opera was transferred to rossini s  to which the title the barber of seville passed as an inalienable heritage later in 1822,  a 30-year-old  rossini succeeded in meeting ludwig van beethoven  who was then aged 51,  deaf  cantankerous and in failing health  communicating in writing  beethoven noted   ah  rossini  so you re the composer of the barber of seville  i congratulate you  it will be played as long as italian opera exists  never try to write anything else but opera buffa  any other style would do violence to your 1815  and 1823  rossini produced 20  operas  of these  otello formed the climax to his reform of serious opera  opera seria   and offers a suggestive contrast with the treatment of the same subject at a similar point of artistic development by the composer giuseppe verdi  in rossini s time  the tragic ending was so distasteful to the public of rome that it was necessary to invent a happy conclusion to otello conditions of stage production in 1817  are illustrated by rossini s acceptance of the subject of cinderella for a libretto only on the condition that the supernatural element should be omitted  the opera la cenerentola was as successful as barbiere  the absence of a similar precaution in construction of his mosè in egitto led to disaster in the scene depicting the passage of the israelites through the red sea  when the defects in stage contrivance always raised a laugh  so that the composer was at length compelled to introduce the chorus  dal tuo stellato soglio  to divert attention from the dividing waves in 1822,  four years after the production of this work  rossini married the renowned opera singer isabella colbran  in the same year  he moved from italy to vienna  where his operas were the rage of the audiences  he directed his cenerentola in vienna  where zelmira was also performed  after this he returned to bologna  but an invitation from metternich to the congress of verona to  assist in the general re-establishment  of harmony  was too tempting to refuse  and he arrived at the congress in time for its opening on 20  october 1822.  here he made friends with chateaubriand and dorothea lieven  the opera semiramide was first performed at la fenice in venice on 3  february 1823.  it was rossini s last italian opera in 1823,  at the suggestion of the manager of the king s theatre  london  he came to britain  being much fêted on his way through paris  he was given a generous welcome  which included an introduction to king george iv and the receipt of £7000  (£570000  today  after a residence of five months  the next year  he became musical director of the théâtre des italiens in paris at a salary of £800  (£63000  today  per annum  rossini s popularity in paris was so great that charles x gave him a contract to write five new operas a year  and at the expiration of the contract  he was to receive a generous pension for life during his paris years  rossini created the comic operas le comte ory and guillaume tell  william tell   the production of the latter in 1829  brought his career as a writer of opera to a close  fabio luisi said that rossini planned for guillaume tell to be his last opera even as he composed he was thirty-eight  years old and had already composed thirty-eight  operas  guillaume tell was a political epic adapted from schiller s play wilhelm tell (1804)  about the 13th-century  swiss patriot who rallied his country against the austrians  the libretto was by étienne jouy and hippolyte bis  but their version was revised by armand music is remarkable for its freedom from the conventions discovered and utilized by rossini in his earlier works  and marks a transitional stage in the history of opera  the overture serving as a model for romantic overtures throughout the 19th  century  though an excellent opera  it is rarely heard uncut today  as the original score runs more than four hours in performance  the overture is one of the most famous and frequently recorded works in the classical repertoire in 1829  he returned to bologna  his mother had died in 1827,  and he was anxious to be with his father  arrangements for his subsequent return to paris on a new agreement were temporarily upset by the abdication of charles x and the july revolution of 1830.  rossini  who had been considering the subject of faust for a new opera  did return  however  to paris in november of that year six movements of his stabat were written in 1832  by rossini himself and the other six by giovanni tadolini  a good musician who was asked by rossini to complete the work  however  rossini composed the rest of the score in 1841.  the success of the work bears comparison with his achievements in opera  but his comparative silence during the period from 1832  to his death in 1868  makes his biography appear almost like the narrative of two lives—the life of swift triumph and the long life of seclusion  of which biographers give us pictures in stories of the composer s cynical wit  his speculations in fish his mask of humility and indifference his first wife died in 1845,  and on 16  august 1846,  he married olympe pélissier  who had sat for vernet for his picture of judith and holofernes  political disturbances compelled rossini to leave bologna in 1848.  after living for a time in florence  he settled in paris in 1855,  where he hosted many artistic and literary figures in his apartment at 2  rue de la among whom the forty years younger belgian mattauphone virtuoso edmond considering him as his quasi figlio rossini had been a well-known  gourmand and an excellent amateur chef his entire life  but he indulged these two passions fully once he retired from composing  and today there are a number of dishes with the appendage  alla rossini  to their names that were created either by or specifically for him  probably the most famous of these is tournedos rossini  still served by many restaurants today in the meantime  after years of various physical and mental illnesses  he had slowly returned to music  composing obscure little works intended for private performance  these included his péchés de vieillesse   sins of old age    which are grouped into 14  volumes  mostly for solo piano  occasionally for voice and various chamber ensembles  often whimsical  these pieces display rossini s natural ease of composition and gift for melody  showing obvious influences of beethoven and chopin  with many flashes of the composer s long buried desire for serious  academic composition  they also underpin the fact that rossini himself was an outstanding pianist whose playing attracted high praise from people such as franz liszt  sigismond thalberg  camille saint-saëns  and louis died at the age of 76  from pneumonia at his country house at passy on friday  13  november 1868.  he was buried in père lachaise cemetery in paris  france  in 1887,  his remains were moved to the basilica of santa croce  florence  at the request of the italian government according to herbert weinstock s 1968  the composer s estate was valued at 2.5  million francs upon his death in 1868,  the equivalent of about 1.4  million us dollars  according to one contemporary account  at the time of rossini s death  his estate yielded revenues of 150,000  francs per apart from some individual legacies in favour of his wife and rossini willed his entire estate to the comune of the inheritance was invested to establish a liceo musicale  conservatory  in the town  in 1940,  the liceo was put under state control and turned into the conservatorio statale di musica  gioachino rossini   the corporate body which managed rossini s inheritance assumed the name fondazione g  rossini  the aims of the institution  which is still active  are to support the conservatory and promote the figure  the memory  and the works of rossini  the institution has been a major sponsor of the rossini opera festival since its estate funded the prix rossini  a prize awarded to young french composers and librettists  the prize began to be awarded in 1878  on the death of his widow and is given by the académie des beaux-arts.  prize-winning  works were produced by the société des concerts  institut de france  from 1885  to the bequest sought to reward composers of music which emphasized melody  which rossini wrote  today is neglected    melodia  oggi si trascurata    the prize for librettists was to be given to writers who observed  the laws of morality  which the modern writers completely ignore    osservando le leggi della morale di cui i moderni scrittori piu non tengono verun conto    the prizes were exclusively for french composers and librettists   exclusivamente per i was a foreign associate of the institute  grand officer of the legion of honour and recipient of innumerable orders immediately after rossini s death  giuseppe verdi proposed to collaborate with twelve other italian composers on a requiem for rossini  to be performed on the first anniversary of rossini s death  conducted by angelo mariani  the music was written  but the performance was abandoned shortly before its scheduled premiere  verdi re-used  the  libera me  domine  he had written for the rossini requiem in his 1872  requiem for manzoni  in 1989  the conductor helmuth rilling recorded the original requiem for rossini in its world premiere in 1900,  giuseppe cassioli created a monument to rossini in the basilica of santa croce  library of the royal conservatory of brussels possesses an important collection of scores  documents and objects from rossini  assembled in the edmond michotte needed mauro giuliani  who died in 1829)  wrote six sets of variations for guitar on themes by rossini  opp  119–124   c  1820–1828).  each set was called  rossiniana   and collectively they are called  rossiniane   this was the first known tribute by one composer to another using a title with the ending -ana.in  1925,  ottorino respighi orchestrated four pieces from péchés de vieillesse as the suite rossiniana  he had earlier used pieces from the same collection as the basis of his ballet la boutique fantasque  according to the oxford history of western music   rossini s fame surpassed that of any previous composer  and so  for a long time  did the popularity of his works  audiences took to his music as if to an intoxicating drug—or  to put it more decorously  to champagne  with which rossini s bubbly music was constantly took existing operatic genres and forms and perfected them in his own style  through his own work  as well as through that of his followers and imitators  rossini s style dominated italian opera throughout the first half of the 19th  his compositions  rossini plagiarized freely from himself  a common practice among deadline-pressed  opera composers of the time  few of his operas are without such admixtures  frankly introduced in the form of arias or overtures  for example  in il barbiere there is an aria for the count  often omitted   cessa di più resistere   which rossini used  with minor changes  in the cantata le nozze di teti e di peleo and in la cenerentola  the cabaletta for angelina s rondo is almost unchanged   moreover  four of his best known overtures  la cambiale di matrimonio  tancredi  la cenerentola and the barber of seville  share operas apart from those with which they are most famously associated a characteristic mannerism in rossini s orchestral scoring is a long  steady building of sound over an ostinato figure  known as a  rossini creating  tempests in teapots by beginning in a whisper and rising to a flashing  glittering which earned him the nickname of  signor crescendo  a few of rossini s operas remained popular throughout his lifetime and continuously since his death  others were resurrected from semi-obscurity  in the last half of the 20th  century  during the so-called   rossini renaissance  rossini himself correctly predicted that his barber of seville would continue to find favor with posterity  telling a friend generalrossinitexts  bookssheet
