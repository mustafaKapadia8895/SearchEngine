 north pole -  wikipediacoordinates  90°n  0°w﻿    ﻿90°n  -0°e﻿    90;  -0the  north pole  also known as the geographic north pole or terrestrial north pole  is  subject to the caveats explained below  defined as the point in the northern hemisphere where the earth s axis of rotation meets its surface the north pole is the northernmost point on the earth  lying diametrically opposite the south pole  it defines geodetic latitude 90°  north  as well as the direction of true north  at the north pole all directions point south  all lines of longitude converge there  so its longitude can be defined as any degree value  along tight latitude circles  counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west  the north pole is at the center of the northern hemisphere while the south pole lies on a continental land mass  the north pole is located in the middle of the arctic ocean amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice  this makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the north pole  unlike the south pole   however  the soviet union  and later russia  constructed a number of manned drifting stations on a generally annual basis since 1937,  some of which have passed over or very close to the pole  since 2002,  the russians have also annually established a base  barneo  close to the pole  this operates for a few weeks during early spring  studies in the 2000s  predicted that the north pole may become seasonally ice-free  because of arctic ice shrinkage  with timescales varying from to the late 21st  century or later the sea depth at the north pole has been measured at 4,261  m (13,980  ft  by the russian mir submersible in and at 4,087  m (13,410  ft  by uss nautilus in the nearest land is usually said to be kaffeklubben island  off the northern coast of greenland about 700  km (430  mi  away  though some perhaps non-permanent  gravel banks lie slightly closer  the nearest permanently inhabited place is alert in the qikiqtaaluk region  nunavut  canada  which is located 817  km (508  mi  from the pole the earth s axis of rotation – and hence the position of the north pole – was commonly believed to be fixed  relative to the surface of the earth  until  in the 18th  century  the mathematician leonhard euler predicted that the axis might  wobble  slightly  around the beginning of the 20th  century astronomers noticed a small apparent  variation of latitude   as determined for a fixed point on earth from the observation of stars  part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the pole across the earth s surface  by a range of a few metres  the wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component  the component with a period of about 435  days is identified with the eight-month  wandering predicted by euler and is now called the chandler wobble after its discoverer  the exact point of intersection of the earth s axis and the earth s surface  at any given moment  is called the  instantaneous pole   but because of the  wobble  this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed north pole  or south pole  when metre-scale  precision is required it is desirable to tie the system of earth coordinates  latitude  longitude  and elevations or orography  to fixed landforms  of course  given plate tectonics and isostasy  there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed  yet the international earth rotation and reference systems service and the international astronomical union have defined a framework called the international terrestrial reference system as early as the 16th  century  many prominent people correctly believed that the north pole was in a sea  which in the 19th  century was called the polynya or open polar it was therefore hoped that passage could be found through ice floes at favorable times of the year  several expeditions set out to find the way  generally with whaling ships  already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes one of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the north pole was that of british naval officer william edward parry  who in 1827  reached latitude 82°45′  north  in 1871  the polaris expedition  a us attempt on the pole led by charles francis hall  ended in disaster  another british royal navy attempt on the pole  part of the british arctic expedition  by commander albert h  markham reached a then-record  83°20'26"  north in may 1876  before turning back  an 1879–1881  expedition commanded by us naval officer george w  delong ended tragically when their ship  the uss jeanette  was crushed by ice  over half the crew  including delong  were lost in april 1895  the norwegian explorers fridtjof nansen and hjalmar johansen struck out for the pole on skis after leaving nansen s icebound ship fram  the pair reached latitude 86°14′  north before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards  eventually reaching franz josef land in 1897  swedish engineer salomon august andrée and two companions tried to reach the north pole in the hydrogen balloon örnen   eagle    but came down 300  km (190  mi  north of kvitøya  the northeasternmost part of the svalbard archipelago  they trekked to kvitøya but died there three months later  in 1930  the remains of this expedition were found by the norwegian bratvaag expedition the italian explorer luigi amedeo  duke of the abruzzi and captain umberto cagni of the italian royal navy  regia marina  sailed the converted whaler stella polare   pole star   from norway in 1899.  on 11  march 1900  cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86°  34’  on 25  april  setting a new record by beating nansen s result of 1895  by 35  to 40  km (22  to 25  mi   cagni barely managed to return to the camp  remaining there until 23  june  on 16  august the stella polare left rudolf island heading south and the expedition returned to norway the us explorer frederick cook claimed to have reached the north pole on 21  april 1908  with two inuit men  ahwelah and etukishook  but he was unable to produce convincing proof and his claim is not widely conquest of the north pole was for many years credited to us navy engineer robert peary  who claimed to have reached the pole on 6  april 1909,  accompanied by matthew henson and four inuit men  ootah  seeglo  egingwah  and ooqueah  however  peary s claim remains highly disputed and controversial  those who accompanied peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in navigation  and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work  which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the pole the distances and speeds that peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people  almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point  peary s account of a journey to the pole and back while traveling along the direct line – the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing – is contradicted by henson s account of tortuous detours to avoid pressure ridges and open leads the british explorer wally herbert  initially a supporter of peary  researched peary s records in 1989  and found that there were significant discrepancies in the explorer s navigational records  he concluded that peary had not reached the support for peary came again in 2005,  however  when british explorer tom avery and four companions recreated the outward portion of peary s journey with replica wooden sleds and canadian eskimo dog teams  reaching the north pole in 36  days  22  hours – nearly five hours faster than peary  however  avery s fastest 5-day  march was 90  nautical miles  significantly short of the 135  claimed by peary  avery writes on his web site that  the admiration and respect which i hold for robert peary  matthew henson and the four inuit men who ventured north in 1909,  has grown enormously since we set out from cape columbia  having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice  i am more convinced than ever that peary did indeed discover the north rejection of peary s claim arrived in 2009,  when e  myles standish of the california institute of technology  an experienced referee of scientific claims  reported numerous alleged lacunae and source  the first claimed flight over the pole was made on 9  may 1926  by us naval officer richard e  byrd and pilot floyd bennett in a fokker tri-motor  aircraft  although verified at the time by a committee of the national geographic society  this claim has since been by the 1996  revelation that byrd s long-hidden  diary s solar sextant data  which the ngs never checked  consistently contradict his june 1926  report s parallel data by over 100  mi (160  the secret report s alleged en-route  solar sextant data were inadvertently so impossibly overprecise that he excised all these alleged raw solar observations out of the version of the report finally sent to geographical societies five months later  while the original version was hidden for 70  years   a realization first published in 2000  by the university of cambridge after scrupulous to standish   anyone who is acquainted with the facts and has any amount of logical reasoning can not avoid the conclusion that neither cook  nor peary  nor byrd reached the north pole  and they all knew source  the first consistent  verified  and scientifically convincing attainment of the pole was on 12  may 1926,  by norwegian explorer roald amundsen and his us sponsor lincoln ellsworth from the airship norge  though norwegian-owned,  was designed and piloted by the italian umberto nobile  the flight started from svalbard in norway  and crossed the arctic ocean to alaska  nobile  with several scientists and crew from the norge  overflew the pole a second time on 24  may 1928,  in the airship italia  the italia crashed on its return from the pole  with the loss of half the crew in may 1937  the world s first north pole ice station  north pole-1,  was established by soviet scientists by air 20  kilometres (13  mi  from the north pole  the expedition members  oceanographer pyotr shirshov  meteorologist yevgeny fyodorov  radio operator ernst krenkel  and the leader ivan conducted scientific research at the station for the next nine months  by 19  february 1938,  when the group was picked up by the ice breakers taimyr and murman  their station had drifted 2850  km to the eastern coast of may 1945  an raf lancaster of the aries expedition became the first commonwealth aircraft to overfly the north geographic and north magnetic poles  the plane was piloted by david cecil mckinley of the royal air force  it carried an 11-man  crew  with kenneth c  maclure of the royal canadian air force in charge of all scientific observations  in 2006,  maclure was honoured with a spot in canada s aviation hall of peary s disputed claim  the first men to set foot at the north pole were a soviet including geophysicists mikhail ostrekin and pavel senko  oceanographers mikhail somov and pavel and other scientists and flight crew (24  people in of aleksandr kuznetsov s sever-2  expedition  march–may it was organized by the chief directorate of the northern sea the party flew on three planes  pilots ivan cherevichnyy  vitaly maslennikov and ilya kotov  from kotelny island to the north pole and landed there at 4:44pm   moscow time  utc+04:00)  on 23  april they established a temporary camp and for the next two days conducted scientific observations  on 26  april the expedition flew back to the continent next year  on 9  may two other soviet scientists  vitali volovich and andrei became the first people to parachute onto the north they jumped from a douglas c-47  skytrain  registered cccp 3  may 1952  u s  air force lieutenant colonel joseph o  fletcher and lieutenant william pershing benedict  along with scientist albert p  crary  landed a modified douglas c-47  skytrain at the north pole  some western sources considered this to be the first landing at the until the soviet landings became widely known the united states navy submarine uss nautilus (ssn-571)  crossed the north pole on 3  august 1958.  on 17  march 1959  uss skate (ssn-578)  surfaced at the pole  breaking through the ice above it  becoming the first naval vessel to do aside peary s claim  the first confirmed surface conquest of the north pole was that of ralph plaisted  walt pederson  gerry pitzl and jean luc bombardier  who traveled over the ice by snowmobile and arrived on 19  april 1968.  the united states air force independently confirmed their position on 6  april 1969  wally herbert and companions allan gill  roy koerner and kenneth hedges of the british trans-arctic  expedition became the first men to reach the north pole on foot  albeit with the aid of dog teams and airdrops   they continued on to complete the first surface crossing of the arctic ocean – and by its longest axis  barrow  alaska to svalbard – a feat that has never been because of suggestions  later proven false  of plaisted s use of air transport  some sources classify herbert s expedition as the first confirmed to reach the north pole over the ice surface by any in the 1980s  plaisted s pilots weldy phipps and ken lee signed affidavits asserting that no such airlift was it is also said that herbert was the first person to reach the pole of 17  august 1977  the soviet nuclear-powered  icebreaker arktika completed the first surface vessel journey to the north pole in 1982  ranulph fiennes and charles r  burton became the first people to cross the arctic ocean in a single season  they departed from cape crozier  ellesmere island  on 17  february 1982  and arrived at the geographic north pole on 10  april 1982.  they travelled on foot and snowmobile  from the pole  they travelled towards svalbard but  due to the unstable nature of the ice  ended their crossing at the ice edge after drifting south on an ice floe for 99  days  they were eventually able to walk to their expedition ship mv benjamin bowring and boarded it on 4  august 1982  at position 80:31n  00:59w.  as a result of this journey  which formed a section of the three-year  transglobe expedition 1979–1982,  fiennes and burton became the first people to complete a circumnavigation of the world via both north and south poles  by surface travel alone  this achievement remains unchallenged to this day in 1985  sir edmund hillary  the first man to stand on the summit of mount everest  and neil armstrong  the first man to stand on the moon  landed at the north pole in a small twin-engined  ski hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of everest in 1986  will steger  with seven teammates  became the first to be confirmed as reaching the pole by dogsled and without resupply on 6  may 1986  uss archerfish  ssn 678),  uss ray  ssn 653)  and uss hawkbill (ssn-666)  surfaced at the north pole  the first tri-submarine  surfacing at the north pole on 21  april 1987  shinji kazama of japan became the first person to reach the north pole on a 18  may 1987  uss billfish  ssn 676),  uss sea devil  ssn 664)  and hms superb  s 109)  surfaced at the north pole  the first international surfacing at the north pole in 1988  a 13-man  strong team (9  soviets  4  canadians  skied across the arctic from siberia to northern canada  one of the canadians  richard weber became the first person to reach the pole from both sides of the arctic ocean on 4  may 1990  børge ousland and erling kagge became the first explorers ever to reach the north pole unsupported  after a 58-day  ski trek from ellesmere island in canada  a distance of 800  7  september 1991  the german research vessel polarstern and the swedish icebreaker oden reached the north pole as the first conventional powered both scientific parties and crew took oceanographic and geological samples and had a common tug of war and a football game on an ice floe  polarstern again reached the pole exactly 10  years with the healy in 1998,  1999,  and 2000  lada niva marshs  special very large wheeled versions made by bronto  lada vaz s experimental product division  were driven to the north the 1998  expedition was dropped by parachute and completed the track to the north pole  the 2000  expedition departed from a russian research base around 114  km from the pole and claimed an average speed of 20–15  km h in an average temperature of −30  °c commercial airliner flights on the polar routes may pass within viewing distance of the north pole  for example  the flight from chicago to beijing may come close as latitude 89°  n  though because of prevailing winds return journeys go over the bering strait  in recent years journeys to the north pole by air  landing by helicopter or on a runway prepared on the ice  or by icebreaker have become relatively routine  and are even available to small groups of tourists through adventure holiday companies  parachute jumps have frequently been made onto the north pole in recent years  the temporary seasonal russian camp of barneo has been established by air a short distance from the pole annually since 2002,  and caters for scientific researchers as well as tourist parties  trips from the camp to the pole itself may be arranged overland or by helicopter the first attempt at underwater exploration of the north pole was made on 22  april 1998  by russian firefighter and diver andrei rozhkov with the support of the diving club of moscow state university  but ended in fatality  the next attempted dive at the north pole was organized the next year by the same diving club  and ended in success on 24  april 1999.  the divers were michael wolff  austria   brett cormick  uk   and bob wass 2005  the united states navy submarine uss charlotte (ssn-766)  surfaced through 155  cm (61  in  of ice at the north pole and spent 18  hours july 2007  british endurance swimmer lewis gordon pugh completed a 1  km (0.62  mi  swim at the north pole  his feat  undertaken to highlight the effects of global warming  took place in clear water that had opened up between the ice his later attempt to paddle a kayak to the north pole in late 2008,  following the erroneous prediction of clear water to the pole  was stymied when his expedition found itself stuck in thick ice after only three days  the expedition was then abandoned by september 2007  the north pole had been visited 66  times by different surface ships  54  times by soviet and russian icebreakers  4  times by swedish oden  3  times by german polarstern  3  times by uscgc healy and uscgc polar sea  and once by ccgs louis s  st-laurent  and by swedish vidar 2  august 2007  a russian scientific expedition arktika 2007  made the first ever manned descent to the ocean floor at the north pole  to a depth of 4.3  km (2.7  mi   as part of the research programme in support of russia s 2001  extended continental shelf claim to a large swathe of the arctic ocean floor  the descent took place in two mir submersibles and was led by soviet and russian polar explorer artur chilingarov  in a symbolic act of visitation  the russian flag was placed on the ocean floor exactly at the expedition was the latest in a series of efforts intended to give russia a dominant influence in the arctic according to the new york the warming arctic climate and summer shrinkage of the iced area has attracted the attention of many countries  such as china and the united states  toward the top of the world  where resources and shipping routes may soon be 2009  the russian marine live-ice  automobile expedition—mlae 2009   vasily elagin as

vehicles reached the pole on 6  april and then continued to the canadian coast  the coast was reached on 30  april 2013  (83°08n,  075°59w),  and on 5  may 2013,  the expedition finished in resolute

across drifting ice and about 4000  km in total  the expedition was totally self-dependent  and used no external supplies  the expedition was supported by the russian geographical sun at the north pole is continuously above the horizon during the summer and continuously below the horizon during the winter  sunrise is just before the march equinox  around 20  march   the sun then takes three months to reach its highest point of near 23½°  elevation at the summer solstice  around 21  june   after which time it begins to sink  reaching sunset just after the september equinox  around 23  september   when the sun is visible in the polar sky  it appears to move in a horizontal circle above the horizon  this circle gradually rises from near the horizon just after the vernal equinox to its maximum elevation  in degrees  above the horizon at summer solstice and then sinks back toward the horizon before sinking below it at the autumnal equinox  hence the north and south poles experience the slowest rates of sunrise and sunset on earth a civil twilight period of about two weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset  a nautical twilight period of about five weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset and an astronomical twilight period of about seven weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset these effects are caused by a combination of the earth s axial tilt and its revolution around the sun  the direction of the earth s axial tilt  as well as its angle relative to the plane of the earth s orbit around the sun  remains very nearly constant over the course of a year  both change very slowly over long time periods   at northern midsummer the north pole is facing towards the sun to its maximum extent  as the year progresses and the earth moves around the sun  the north pole gradually turns away from the sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the sun to its maximum extent  a similar sequence is observed at the south pole  with a six-month  time difference in most places on earth  local time is determined by longitude  such that the time of day is more-or-less  synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky  for example  at midday the sun is roughly at its highest   this line of reasoning fails at the north pole  where the sun rises and sets only once per year  and all lines of longitude  and hence all time zones  converge  there is no permanent human presence at the north pole and no particular time zone has been assigned  polar expeditions may use any time zone that is convenient  such as greenwich mean time  or the time zone of the country from which they needed  the north pole is substantially warmer than the south pole because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean  which acts as a reservoir of heat   rather than at altitude on a continental land mass  despite being an ice cap  it shares some characteristics with a tundra climate  etf  due to the july and august temperatures peaking just above freezing winter temperatures at the north pole can range from about −50  to −13  °c (−58  to 9  °f   averaging around −31  °c (−24  °f  a however  a freak storm caused the temperature to reach 0.7  °c (33  °f  for a time at a world meteorological organization buoy  located at 87.45°n,  on december 30,  2015.  it was estimated that the temperature at the north pole was between 30  and 35  °f (−1  and 2  °c  during the summer temperatures  june  july  and august  average around the freezing point (0  °c (32  °f    the highest temperature yet recorded is 13  °c (55  much warmer than the south pole s record high of only −12.3  °c (9.9  a similar spike in temperatures would occur on november 15,  2016,  and would last for several update the sea ice at the north pole is typically around 2  to 3  m (6  ft 7  in to 9  ft 10  in  although ice thickness  its spatial extent  and the fraction of open water within the ice pack can vary rapidly and profoundly in response to weather and studies have shown that the average ice thickness has decreased in recent it is likely that global warming has contributed to this  but it is not possible to attribute the recent abrupt decrease in thickness entirely to the observed warming in the reports have also predicted that within a few decades the arctic ocean will be entirely free of ice in the this may have significant commercial implications  see  territorial claims   below the retreat of the arctic sea ice will accelerate global warming  as less ice cover reflects less solar radiation  and may have serious climate implications by contributing to arctic cyclone bears are believed rarely to travel beyond about 82°  north owing to the scarcity of food  though tracks have been seen in the vicinity of the north pole  and a 2006  expedition reported sighting a polar bear just 1  mi (1.6  km  from the the ringed seal has also been seen at the pole  and arctic foxes have been observed less than 60  km (37  mi  away at 89°40′  seen at or very near the pole include the snow bunting  northern fulmar and black-legged  kittiwake  though some bird sightings may be distorted by the tendency of birds to follow ships and have been seen in the waters at the north pole  but these are probably few in a member of the russian team that descended to the north pole seabed in august 2007  reported seeing no sea creatures living however  it was later reported that a sea anemone had been scooped up from the seabed mud by the russian team and that video footage from the dive showed unidentified shrimps and under international law  no country owns

nations convention on the law of the sea  a country has 10  years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200-mile  exclusive economic zone  if validated  such a claim gives the

the location of santa claus  workshop and although the depictions have been inconsistent between the geographic and magnetic north needed  canada post has assigned postal code h0h  0h0  to the north pole  referring to santa s traditional exclamation of  ho ho association reflects an age-old  esoteric mythology of hyperborea that posits the north pole  the otherworldly world-axis,  as the abode of

cultural worldview of sufism and iranian mysticism   the orient sought by the mystic  the orient that cannot be located on our maps  is in the direction of the north  beyond the to its remoteness  the pole is sometimes identified with a mysterious mountain of ancient iranian tradition called mount qaf  jabal qaf   the  farthest point of the according to certain authors  the jabal qaf of muslim cosmology is a version of rupes nigra  a mountain whose ascent  like dante s climbing of the mountain of purgatory  represents the pilgrim s progress through spiritual in iranian theosophy  the
