 diurnal temperature variation -  wikipediain meteorology  diurnal temperature variation is the variation between a high temperature and a low temperature that occurs during the same day temperature lag is an important factor in diurnal temperature variation  peak daily temperature generally occurs after noon  as air keeps net absorbing heat even after noon  and similarly minimum daily temperature generally occurs substantially after midnight  indeed occurring during early morning in the hour around dawn  since heat is lost all night long  the analogous annual phenomenon is seasonal lag as solar energy strikes the earth’s surface each morning  a shallow 1–3-centimetre  (0.39–1.18  in  layer of air directly above the ground is heated by conduction  heat exchange between this shallow layer of warm air and the cooler air above is very inefficient  on a warm summer’s day  for example  air temperatures may vary by 16.5  °c (30  °f  from just above the ground to waist height  incoming solar radiation exceeds outgoing heat energy for many hours after noon and equilibrium is usually reached from 3–5  p m  but this may be affected by a variety of different things such as large bodies of water  soil type and cover  wind  cloud cover water vapor  and moisture on the temperature variations are greatest very near the earth’s surface high desert areas typically have the greatest diurnal temperature variations  low lying  humid areas typically have the least  this explains why an area like the snake river plain can have high temperatures of 38  °c (100  °f  during a summer day  and then have lows of 5–10  °c (41–50  °f   at the same time  washington d c   which is much more humid  has temperature variations of only 8  °c (14  urban hong kong has a diurnal temperature range of little more than 4  °c (7.2  °f  while the national park service claimed that the world record is a variation of 102  °f (56.7  °c   from 46  °f or 7.8  °c to −56  °f or −48.9  °c  in browning  montana in the montana department of environmental quality claimed that loma  montana also had a variation of 102  °f (56.7  °c   from −54  °f or −47.8  °c to 48  °f or 8.9  °c  in temperature variation is of particular importance in viticulture  wine regions situated in areas of high altitude experience the most dramatic swing in temperature variation during the course of a day  in grapes  this variation has the effect of producing high acid and high sugar content as the grapes  exposure to sunlight increases the ripening qualities while the sudden drop in temperature at night preserves the balance of natural acids in the
