 thunderstorm -  wikipediaa thunderstorm  also known as an electrical storm  lightning storm  or thundershower  is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the earth s atmosphere  known as thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus  they are usually accompanied by strong winds  heavy rain  and sometimes snow  sleet  hail  or  in contrast  no precipitation at all  thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband  known as a squall line  strong or severe thunderstorms  known as supercells  rotate as do cyclones  while most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy  vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm  moist air  sometimes along a front  as the warm  moist air moves upward  it cools  condenses  and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over 20  kilometres (12  mi   as the rising air reaches its dew point temperature  water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice  reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell  any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the earth s surface  as the droplets fall  they collide with other droplets and become larger  the falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it  and this cold air spreads out at the earth s surface  occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid-latitude,  where warm  moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena  thunderstorms  and the phenomena that occur along with them  pose great hazards  damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds  large hailstones  and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation  stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts there are four types of thunderstorms  single-cell,  multi-cell  cluster  multi-cell  lines  and supercells  supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe  mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes  dry thunderstorms  with no precipitation  can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground  lightning that accompanies them  several means are used to study thunderstorms  weather radar  weather stations  and video photography  past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th  century  beyond the earth s atmosphere  thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of jupiter  saturn  neptune  and  probably  venus warm air has a lower density than cool air  so warmer air rises upwards and cooler air will settle at the  this effect can be seen with a hot air clouds form as relatively warmer air  carrying moisture  rises within cooler air  the moist air rises  and  as it does so  it cools and some of the water vapor in that rising air when the moisture condenses  it releases energy known as latent heat of vaporization  which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than the cooler surrounding continuing the cloud s ascension  if enough instability is present in the atmosphere  this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form and produce lightning and thunder  meteorological indices such as convective available potential energy  cape  and the lifted index can be used to assist in determining potential upward vertical development of generally  thunderstorms require three conditions to form all thunderstorms  regardless of type  go through three stages  the developing stage  the mature stage  and the dissipation the average thunderstorm has a 24  km (15  mi  diameter  depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere  each of these three stages take an average of 30  first stage of a thunderstorm is the cumulus stage or developing stage  during this stage  masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere  the trigger for this lift can be solar illumination  where the heating of the ground produces thermals  or where two winds converge forcing air upwards  or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation  the moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude  which appear as cumulus clouds  as the water vapor condenses into liquid  latent heat is released  which warms the air  causing it to become less dense than the surrounding  drier air  the air tends to rise in an updraft through the process of convection  hence the term convective precipitation   this process creates a low-pressure  zone within and beneath the forming thunderstorm  in a typical thunderstorm  approximately 500  million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the earth s the mature stage of a thunderstorm  the warmed air continues to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther  often this  cap  is the tropopause  the air is instead forced to spread out  giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape  the resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus  the water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles  as these fall  they melt to become rain  if the updraft is strong enough  the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large that they do not melt completely but fall as hail  while updrafts are still present  the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it  creating downdrafts as well  the simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds  during this stage  considerable internal turbulence can occur within  which manifests as strong winds  severe lightning  and even if there is little wind shear  the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and  rain itself but  if there is sufficient change in wind speed and or direction  the downdraft will be separated from the updraft  and the storm may become a supercell  where the mature stage can sustain itself for several the dissipation stage  the thunderstorm is dominated by the downdraft  if atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development  this stage occurs rather quickly  approximately 20–30  minutes into the life of the thunderstorm  the downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm  hit the ground and spread out  this phenomenon is known as a downburst  the cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm  the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate  thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions  which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm  moist air  and kills the thunderstorm s further the downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary  this can cause downbursts  a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through  as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs  resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft  the stronger the outflow boundary is  the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear are four main types of thunderstorms  single-cell,  multi-cell,  squall line  also called multi-cell  line  and supercell  which type forms depends on the instability and relative wind conditions at different layers of the atmosphere   wind shear    single-cell  thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20–30  minutes organized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of significant vertical wind shear  normally greater than 25  knots (13  m s  in the lowest 6  kilometres (3.7  mi  of the which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather  the supercell is the strongest of the thunderstorms  most commonly associated with large hail  high winds  and tornado formation  precipitable water values of greater than 31.8  millimetres (1.25  in  favor the development of organized thunderstorm those with heavy rainfall normally have precipitable water values greater than 36.9  millimetres (1.45  upstream values of cape of greater than 800  j kg are usually required for the development of organized term technically applies to a single thunderstorm with one main updraft  also known as air-mass  thunderstorms  these are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales  they also occur in the cool unstable air that often follows the passage of a cold front from the sea during winter  within a cluster of thunderstorms  the term  cell  refers to each separate principal updraft  thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation  as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary that sets up new thunderstorm development  such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability  hence the term  air mass thunderstorm   when such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them  it is known as a pulse severe storm  pulse severe storms are poorly organized and occur randomly in time and space  making them difficult to forecast  single-cell  thunderstorms normally last 20–30  is the most common type of thunderstorm development  mature thunderstorms are found near the center of the cluster  while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side  multicell storms form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines  while each cell of the cluster may only last 20  minutes  the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time  they often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries  such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure  these type of storms are stronger than the single-cell  storm  yet much weaker than the supercell storm  hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized  hail  flash flooding  and weak squall line is an elongated line of severe thunderstorms that can form along and or ahead of a cold in the early 20th  century  the term was used as a synonym for cold the squall line contains heavy precipitation  hail  frequent lightning  strong straight line winds  and possibly tornadoes and severe weather in the form of strong straight-line  winds can be expected in areas where the squall line itself is in the shape of a bow echo  within the portion of the line that bows out the tornadoes can be found along waves within a line echo wave pattern  or lewp  where mesoscale low pressure areas are some bow echoes in the summer are called derechos  and move quite fast through large sections of on the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines  a wake low can form  which is a mesoscale low pressure area that forms behind the mesoscale high pressure system normally present under the rain canopy  which are sometimes associated with a heat this kind of storm is also known as  wind of the stony lake   traditional chinese 石湖風 – shi2  hu2  feng1,  simplified chinese  石湖风  in southern storms are large  usually severe  quasi-steady-state  storms that form in an environment where wind speed or wind direction varies with height   wind shear    and they have separate downdrafts and updrafts  i e   where its associated precipitation is not falling through the updraft  with a strong  rotating updraft  a  mesocyclone    these storms normally have such powerful updrafts that the top of the supercell storm cloud  or anvil  can break through the troposphere and reach into the lower levels of the stratosphere  and supercell storms can be 24  kilometres (15  mi  wide  research has shown that at least 90  percent of supercells cause severe these storms can produce destructive tornadoes  sometimes f3  or higher  extremely large hailstones (10  centimetres or 4  inches diameter   straight-line  winds in excess of 130  km h (81  mph   and flash floods  in fact  research has also shown that most tornadoes occur from this type of supercells are the strongest type of thunderstorm  even stronger than the most severe thunderstorm is classed as severe if winds reach at least 93  kilometres per hour (58  mph   hail is 25  millimetres (1  in  in diameter or larger  or if funnel clouds or tornadoes are although a funnel cloud or tornado indicates a severe thunderstorm  a tornado warning is issued in place of a severe thunderstorm warning  a severe thunderstorm warning is issued if a thunderstorm becomes severe  or will soon turn severe  in canada  a rainfall rate greater than 50  millimetres (2  in  in one hour  or 75  millimetres (3  in  in three hours  is also used to indicate severe severe thunderstorms can occur from any type of storm cell  however  multicell  supercell  and squall lines represent the most common forms of thunderstorms that produce severe mesoscale convective system  mcs  is a complex of thunderstorms that becomes organized on a scale larger than the individual thunderstorms but smaller than extratropical cyclones  and normally persists for several hours or a mesoscale convective system s overall cloud and precipitation pattern may be round or linear in shape  and include weather systems such as tropical cyclones  squall lines  lake-effect  snow events  polar lows  and mesoscale convective complexes  mccs   and they generally form near weather fronts  most mesoscale convective systems develop overnight and continue their lifespan through the next the type that forms during the warm season over land has been noted across north america  europe  and asia  with a maximum in activity noted during the late afternoon and evening of mcs that develop in the tropics are found in use either the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon troughs  generally within the warm season between spring and fall  more intense systems form over land than over one exception is that of lake-effect  snow bands  which form due to cold air moving across relatively warm bodies of water  and occurs from fall through polar lows are a second special class of mcs  they form at high latitudes during the cold once the parent mcs dies  later thunderstorm development can occur in connection with its remnant mesoscale convective vortex mesoscale convective systems are important to the united states rainfall climatology over the great plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season two major ways thunderstorms move are via advection of the wind and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture  many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the earth s troposphere  the lowest 8  kilometres (5.0  mi  of the earth s atmosphere  weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the earth s surface than stronger thunderstorms  as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall  organized  long-lived  thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical wind shear vector  if the gust front  or leading edge of the outflow boundary  races ahead of the thunderstorm  its motion will accelerate in tandem  this is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation  hp  than with thunderstorms with low precipitation  lp   when thunderstorms merge  which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other  the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell  the stronger the mean wind  the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion  on weather radar  storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to back-building  thunderstorm  commonly referred to as a training thunderstorm  is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side  usually the west or southwest side in the northern hemisphere   such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction  though the storm often appears stationary on radar  or even moving upwind  this is an illusion  the storm is really a multi-cell  storm with new  more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side  replacing older cells that continue to drift when this happens  catastrophic flooding is possible  in rapid city  south dakota  in 1972,  an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area  resulting in devastating flash a similar event occurred in boscastle  england  on 16  august year  many people are killed or seriously injured by severe thunderstorms despite the advance warning  while severe thunderstorms are most common in the spring and summer  they can occur at just about any time of the year.cloud-to-ground  lightning frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations  one of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of under a regime of low precipitation  lp  thunderstorms  where little precipitation is present  rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on in areas with a high frequency for cloud-to-ground  lightning  like florida  lightning causes several fatalities per year  most commonly to people working rain is also a frequent risk produced by lightning  distilled water has a neutral ph of 7.  “clean” or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic ph of about 5.2,  because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid  a weak acid  ph 5.6  in distilled water   but unpolluted rain also contains other nitric oxide present during thunderstorm caused by the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen  can result in the production of acid rain  if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation  thus creating acid rain  acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or certain other solid chemical compounds  in ecosystems  acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in soil  resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial thunderstorm that produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a thunderclouds that are capable of producing hailstones are often seen obtaining green coloration  hail is more common along mountain ranges because mountains force horizontal winds upwards  known as orographic lifting   thereby intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more one of the more common regions for large hail is across mountainous northern india  which reported one of the highest hail-related  death tolls on record in china also experiences significant across europe  croatia experiences frequent occurrences of north america  hail is most common in the area where colorado  nebraska  and wyoming meet  known as  hail hail in this region occurs between the months of march and october during the afternoon and evening hours  with the bulk of the occurrences from may through september  cheyenne  wyoming is north america s most hail-prone  city with an average of nine to ten hailstorms per in south america  areas prone to hail are cities like bogotá  colombia hail can cause serious damage  notably to automobiles  aircraft  skylights  glass-roofed  structures  livestock  and most commonly  farmers  hail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to aircraft  when hail stones exceed 13  millimetres (0.5  in  in diameter  planes can be seriously damaged within the hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft  wheat  corn  soybeans  and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail hail is one of canada s most costly hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history  one of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 9th  century in roopkund  uttarakhand  the largest hailstone in terms of maximum circumference and length ever recorded in the united states fell in 2003  in aurora  nebraska  united tornado is a violent  rotating column of air in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud  otherwise known as a thundercloud  or  in rare cases  the base of a cumulus cloud  tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel  whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40  and 110  mph (64  and 177  km h   are approximately 75  metres (246  ft  across  and travel several kilometers  a few miles  before dissipating  some attain wind speeds of more than 300  mph (480  km h   stretch more than 1,600  metres (1  mi  across  and stay on the ground for more than 100  kilometres  dozens of fujita scale and the enhanced fujita scale rate tornadoes by damage caused  an ef0  tornado  the weakest category  damages trees but not substantial structures  an ef5  tornado  the strongest category  rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers  the similar torro scale ranges from a t0  for extremely weak tornadoes to t11  for the most powerful known doppler radar data  photogrammetry  and ground swirl patterns  cycloidal marks  may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a have similar characteristics as tornadoes  characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped  wind current that form over bodies of water  connecting to large cumulonimbus clouds  waterspouts are generally classified as forms of tornadoes  or more specifically  non-supercelled  tornadoes that develop over large bodies of these spiralling columns of air are frequently developed within tropical areas close to the equator  but are less common within areas of high flooding is the process where a landscape  most notably an urban environment  is subjected to rapid these rapid floods occur more quickly and are more localized than seasonal river flooding or areal and are frequently  though not always  associated with intense flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving  thunderstorms and is usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it  flash floods are most common in densely populated urban environments  where few plants and bodies of water are present to absorb and contain the extra water  flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure  such as bridges  and weakly constructed buildings  plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water  automobiles parked within affected areas can also be displaced  soil erosion can occur as well  exposing risks of landslide phenomena downburst winds can produce numerous hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms  downburst winds are generally very powerful  and are often mistaken for wind speeds produced by due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal  characteristic  downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable  incomplete  or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings  agricultural crops  and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged  aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds  downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it  due to their higher density  when these downdrafts reach the surface  they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal  asthma is the triggering of an asthma attack by environmental conditions directly caused by a local thunderstorm  during a thunderstorm  pollen grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind  while larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose  the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs  triggering the asthma thunderstorms come and go fairly uneventfully  however  any thunderstorm can become severe  and all thunderstorms  by definition  present the danger of thunderstorm preparedness and safety refers to taking steps before  during  and after a thunderstorm to minimize injury and damage preparedness refers to precautions that should be taken before a thunderstorm  some preparedness takes the form of general readiness  as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or preparing a family emergency plan  for example  can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees  which can be blown over in high winds  can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal national weather service  nws  in the united states recommends several precautions that people should take if thunderstorms are likely to safety and preparedness often overlap  “thunderstorm safety” generally refers to what people should do during and after a storm  the american red cross recommends that people follow these precautions if a storm is imminent or in nws stopped recommending the  lightning crouch  in 2008  as it doesn t provide a significant level of protection and will not significantly lower the risk of being killed or injured from a nearby lightning occur throughout the world  even in the polar regions  with the greatest frequency in tropical rainforest areas  where they may occur nearly daily  at any given time approximately 2,000  thunderstorms are occurring on kampala and tororo in uganda have each been mentioned as the most thunderous places on a claim also made for singapore and bogor on the indonesian island of java  other cities known for frequent storm activity include darwin  caracas  manila and mumbai  thunderstorms are associated with the various monsoon seasons around the globe  and they populate the rainbands of tropical in temperate regions  they are most frequent in spring and summer  although they can occur along or ahead of cold fronts at any time of they may also occur within a cooler air mass following the passage of a cold front over a relatively warmer body of water  thunderstorms are rare in polar regions because of cold surface temperatures some of the most powerful thunderstorms over the united states occur in the midwest and the southern states  these storms can produce large hail and powerful tornadoes  thunderstorms are relatively uncommon along much of the west coast of the united but they occur with greater frequency in the inland areas  particularly the sacramento and san joaquin valleys of california  in spring and summer  they occur nearly daily in certain areas of the rocky mountains as part of the north american monsoon regime  in the northeast  storms take on similar characteristics and patterns as the midwest  but with less frequency and severity  during the summer  air-mass  thunderstorms are an almost daily occurrence over central and southern parts of florida lightning is an electrical discharge that occurs in a thunderstorm  it can be seen in the form of a bright streak  or bolt  from the sky  lightning occurs when an electrical charge is built up within a cloud  due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level  when a large enough charge is built up  a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning the temperature of a lightning bolt can be five times hotter than the surface of the although the lightning is extremely hot  the duration is short and 90%  of strike victims survive  contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot  some people have been struck by lightning over three times  and skyscrapers like the empire state building have been struck numerous times in the same loud bang that is heard is the super heated air around the lightning bolt expanding at the speed of sound  because sound travels much more slowly than light the flash is seen before the bang  although both occur at the same moment there are several types of lightning if the quantity of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known  then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated  in a typical thunderstorm  approximately 5×108  kg of water vapor are lifted  and the amount of energy released when this condenses is 1015  joules  this is on the same order of magnitude of energy released within a tropical cyclone  and more energy than that released during the atomic bomb blast at hiroshima  japan in fermi gamma-ray  burst monitor results show that gamma rays and antimatter particles  positrons  can be generated in powerful it is suggested that the antimatter positrons are formed in terrestrial gamma-ray  flashes  tgf   tgfs are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning  the streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma about 500  tgfs may occur every day worldwide  but mostly go undetected in more contemporary times  thunderstorms have taken on the role of a scientific curiosity  every spring  storm chasers head to the great plains of the united states and the canadian prairies to explore the scientific aspects of storms and tornadoes through use of radio pulses produced by cosmic rays are being used to study how electric charges develop within more organized meteorological projects such as vortex2  use an array of sensors  such as the doppler on wheels  vehicles with mounted automated weather stations  weather balloons  and unmanned aircraft to investigate thunderstorms expected to produce severe lightning is detected remotely using sensors that detect cloud-to-ground  lightning strokes with 95  percent accuracy in detection and within 250  metres (820  ft  of their point of strongly influenced many early civilizations  greeks believed that they were battles waged by zeus  who hurled lightning bolts forged by hephaestus  some american indian tribes associated thunderstorms with the thunderbird  who they believed was a servant of the great the norse considered thunderstorms to occur when thor went to fight jötnar  with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer mjölnir  hinduism recognizes indra as the god of rain and thunderstorms  christian doctrine accepted the ideas of aristotle s original work  called meteorologica  that winds were caused by exhalations from the earth and that fierce storms were the work of god  these ideas were still within the mainstream as late as the 18th  luther was out walking when a thunderstorm began  causing him to pray to god for being saved and promising to become a evidenced by flashes of lightning  on jupiter have been detected and are associated with clouds where water may exist as both a liquid and ice  suggesting that a similar mechanism may act as on earth   water is a polar molecule that can carry a charge  so it is capable of creating the charge separation needed to produce these electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on the the water clouds can form thunderstorms driven by the heat rising from the the clouds of venus may also be capable of producing lightning  some observations suggest that the lightning rate is at least half of that on
