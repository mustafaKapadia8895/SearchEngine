 hurricane kate (1985)  -  wikipediahurricane kate  spanish  huracán kate pronounced ˈket   was the final in a series of tropical cyclones to impact the united states during 1985,  and the latest in any calendar year to strike the country at hurricane intensity on record  the eleventh named storm  seventh hurricane  and third major hurricane of the annual hurricane 1]  kate originated from the interaction of an upper-level  trough and tropical wave northeast of puerto rico on november 15.  though the system tracked erratically during the first hours of its existence  the intensification of a region of high pressure to the cyclone s north caused kate to turn westward  a favorable atmospheric pattern allowed the newly developed system to intensify to hurricane intensity on november 16,  and further to category 2  intensity three days later kate made its first landfall on the northern coast of cuba at this intensity prior to emerging as a slightly weaker storm during the evening hours of november 19.  once clear of land  it began to strengthen quickly  becoming a category 3  and reaching its peak intensity of 120  mph (195  km h  the following on november 21,  a cold front moving across the mississippi valley resulted in a north and eventual northeast turn of the cyclone  and kate came ashore near mexico beach  florida  as a minimal category 2  hurricane with winds of 100  mph (160  km h   gradual weakening ensued as the cyclone moved along the southeast united states coastline  and kate transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on november 23,  a day after exiting the coastline of north carolina the threat of hurricane kate in cuba prompted the evacuation of 360,000  people  heavy rainfall in cuba caused numerous mudslides and flooding  killing 10  people and leading to severe agriculture damage  wind gusts over hurricane intensity resulted in widespread power outages  significant building damage  and major crop damage  damage totaled roughly $400  2]  making it the most damaging hurricane to strike the island in many decades  in preparation for the system s arrival  many hurricane watches and warnings were put into effect  hundreds of thousands of residents were evacuated  and florida governor bob graham declared a state of emergency for six counties  this was later cancelled following the relatively minor impacts of kate  in addition  many shelters were opened when kate struck the florida panhandle  it became the first hurricane to make landfall in that location since hurricane eloise in 1975.  storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry  causing many people to lose their jobs in the weeks after the storm  gusts over 100  mph (160  km h  contributed to downed trees and building damage  while the combination of wind and rain led to downed power poles  across the remainder of the southeast united states  several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding  damage to roadways  and major tree damage  overall  kate resulted in 15  fatalities and $700  million in damage before the formation of hurricane kate  a ridge was located across the southeastern united states for much of the autumn of 1985;  concurrently  a major trough persisted across the western portion of the country  as a result  weather conditions across the gulf of mexico and western atlantic ocean in november were more typical of the pattern in late september  including sea surface temperatures of 81  °f (27  °c   on november 13,  a weak tropical 3]  began interacting with a trough to the northeast of the lesser antilles  it gradually organized due to the favorable conditions  and on november 15,  a hurricane hunters flight into the area indicated the development of a tropical cyclone  as gale force winds were already present  the system was immediately declared tropical storm kate  about 240  miles (385  km  northeast of san juan  puerto a ridge to its north  kate tracked westward after developing  and an upper-level  low developed to the southwest of the storm  the combination of the two provided favorable outflow  allowing kate to quickly intensify  on november 16,  the storm attained hurricane status while moving through the southeastern after continued strengthening  kate made landfall at 0600  utc on november 19  over north-central  cuba with a well-defined  when it moved ashore  kate had a pressure of 967  mbar (28.6  inhg  and winds of about 110  mph (180  the hurricane maintained its well-defined  eye while moving across northern cuba  and about 12  hours after making landfall  it emerged into the southeastern gulf of mexico just east of havana  over the next 24  hours  kate re-intensified  off the southwest coast of florida as it passed about 85  mi (135  km  southwest of key west  on november 20,  the hurricane hunters observed winds as strong as 125  mph (200  km h   and a buoy recorded a gust of 136  mph (219  this was the highest recorded wind gust from a buoy in the gulf of mexico until hurricane lili in based on these observations  it was estimated that kate attained peak winds of about 120  mph (190  km h  around 1200  utc on november kate maintained peak intensity for about 18  on november 21,  a cold front moving through the mississippi valley deflected the hurricane to the north and the combination of cooler waters and wind shear from the front weakened kate to an intensity of 100  mph (160  km h  by the time the hurricane struck crooked island near mexico beach  florida late on november after landfall  kate continued to the northeast  crossing into georgia and weakened into a tropical storm  kate emerged from north carolina into the atlantic ocean late on november 22.  encountering even colder waters and continued shear  the storm weakened further while turning to the east-southeast.  on november 23,  kate transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the west of terminating at 1800  utc that 2011,  kate s was considered the second-latest  hurricane landfall in the united states  behind only a cyclone in 1925  that struck on december 1;  however  a systematic reanalysis indicated that the 1925  system was only a tropical
