 infrared -  wikipediainfrared radiation  or simply infrared or ir  is electromagnetic radiation  emr  with longer wavelengths than those of visible light  and is therefore invisible  although it is sometimes loosely called infrared light  it extends from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700  nanometre  frequency 430  thz   to 1  micrometres (300   although specially pulsed lasers can allow humans to detect ir radiation up to 1050  most of the thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature is infrared  like all emr  ir carries radiant energy  and behaves both like a wave and like its quantum particle  the photon infrared was discovered in 1800  by astronomer sir william herschel  who discovered a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light  by means of its effect on a slightly more than half of the total energy from the sun was eventually found to arrive on earth in the form of infrared  the balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has a critical effect on earth s climate infrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when they change their rotational-vibrational  movements  it excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment  making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry  infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared radiation is used in industrial  scientific  and medical applications  night-vision  devices using active near-infrared  illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected  infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped  telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space such as molecular clouds  detect objects such as planets  and to view highly red-shifted  objects from the early days of the infrared thermal-imaging  cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems  to observe changing blood flow in the skin  and to detect overheating of electrical apparatus.thermal-infrared  imaging is used extensively for military and civilian purposes  military applications include target acquisition  surveillance  night vision  homing  and tracking  humans at normal body temperature radiate chiefly at wavelengths around 10  μm  micrometers   non-military  uses include thermal efficiency analysis  environmental monitoring  industrial facility inspections  remote temperature sensing  short-ranged  wireless communication  spectroscopy  and weather forecasting infrared radiation extends from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700  nanometers  nm  to 1  mm  this range of wavelengths corresponds to a frequency range of approximately 430  thz down to 300  ghz  below infrared is the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum sunlight  at an effective temperature of 5,780  kelvins  is composed of near thermal-spectrum  radiation that is slightly more than half infrared  at zenith  sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1  kilowatt per square meter at sea level  of this energy  527  watts is infrared radiation  445  watts is visible light  and 32  watts is ultraviolet nearly all the infrared radiation in sunlight is near infrared  shorter than 4  micrometers on the surface of earth  at far lower temperatures than the surface of the sun  almost all thermal radiation consists of infrared in mid-infrared  region  much longer than in sunlight  of these natural thermal radiation processes only lightning and natural fires are hot enough to produce much visible energy  and fires produce far more infrared than visible-light  energy in general  objects emit infrared radiation across a spectrum of wavelengths  but sometimes only a limited region of the spectrum is of interest because sensors usually collect radiation only within a specific bandwidth  thermal infrared radiation also has a maximum emission wavelength  which is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of object  in accordance with wien s displacement law therefore  the infrared band is often subdivided into smaller sections a commonly used sub-division  scheme temperatures of black bodies for which spectral peaks fall at the given wavelengths  according to wien s displacement and swir is sometimes called  reflected infrared   whereas mwir and lwir is sometimes referred to as  thermal infrared   due to the nature of the blackbody radiation curves  typical  hot  objects  such as exhaust pipes  often appear brighter in the mw compared to the same object viewed in the lw the international commission on illumination  cie  recommended the division of infrared radiation into the following three 20473  specifies the following typically divide the infrared spectrum as divisions are not precise and can vary depending on the publication  the three regions are used for observation of different temperature ranges  and hence different environments in space the most common photometric system used in astronomy allocates capital letters to different spectral regions according to filters used  i  j  h  and k cover the near-infrared  wavelengths  l  m  n  and q refer to the mid-infrared  region  these letters are commonly understood in reference to atmospheric windows and appear  for instance  in the titles of many papers a third scheme divides up the band based on the response of various is the region closest in wavelength to the radiation detectable by the human eye  mid-  and far-infrared  are progressively further from the visible spectrum  other definitions follow different physical mechanisms  emission peaks  vs  bands  water absorption  and the newest follow technical reasons  the common silicon detectors are sensitive to about 1,050  nm  while ingaas s sensitivity starts around 950  nm and ends between 1,700  and 2,600  nm  depending on the specific configuration   no international standards for these specifications are currently available the onset of infrared is defined  according to different standards  at various values typically between 700  nm and 800  nm  but the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined  the human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700  nm wavelength  so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources  however  particularly intense near-ir  light  e g   from ir lasers  ir led sources  or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels  can be detected up to approximately 780  nm  and will be perceived as red light  intense light sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050  nm can be seen as a dull red glow  causing some difficulty in near-ir  illumination of scenes in the dark  usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination   leaves are particularly bright in the near ir  and if all visible light leaks from around an ir-filter  are blocked  and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque ir-passing  photographic filter  it is possible to see the wood effect that consists of ir-glowing  optical communications  the part of the infrared spectrum that is used is divided into seven bands based on availability of light sources transmitting absorbing materials  fibers  and c-band  is the dominant band for long-distance  telecommunication networks  the s and l bands are based on less well established technology  and are not as widely deployed infrared radiation is popularly known as  heat needed   but light and electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces that absorb them  infrared light from the sun accounts for of the heating of earth  with the rest being caused by visible light that is absorbed then re-radiated  at longer wavelengths  visible light or ultraviolet-emitting  lasers can char paper and incandescently hot objects emit visible radiation  objects at room temperature will emit radiation concentrated mostly in the 8  to 25  µm band  but this is not distinct from the emission of visible light by incandescent objects and ultraviolet by even hotter objects  see black body and wien s displacement is energy in transit that flows due to temperature difference  unlike heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection  thermal radiation can propagate through a vacuum  thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object  due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature  thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength  and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the infrared  extending into visible  ultraviolet  and even x-ray  regions  e g  the solar corona   thus  the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical  comparatively low  temperatures often found near the surface of planet earth the concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects  this is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a black body  to further explain  two objects at the same physical temperature will not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity  for example  for any pre-set  emissivity value  objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter  and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler  for that reason  incorrect selection of emissivity will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers infrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient visible light to night vision devices operate through a process involving the conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are then amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible infrared light sources can be used to augment the available ambient light for conversion by night vision devices  increasing in-the-dark  visibility without actually using a visible light use of infrared light and night vision devices should not be confused with thermal imaging  which creates images based on differences in surface temperature by detecting infrared radiation  heat  that emanates from objects and their surrounding radiation can be used to remotely determine the temperature of objects  if the emissivity is known   this is termed thermography  or in the case of very hot objects in the nir or visible it is termed pyrometry  thermography  thermal imaging  is mainly used in military and industrial applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on cars due to the massively reduced production costs thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum  roughly 900–14,000  nanometers or 0.9–14  μm  and produce images of that radiation  since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures  according to the black body radiation law  thermography makes it possible to  see  one s environment with or without visible illumination  the amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature  therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature  hence the name  a hyperspectral image is a  picture  containing continuous spectrum through a wide spectral range at each pixel  hyperspectral imaging is gaining importance in the field of applied spectroscopy particularly with nir  swir  mwir  and lwir spectral regions  typical applications include biological  mineralogical  defence  and industrial measurements thermal infrared hyperspectral imaging can be similarly performed using a thermographic camera  with the fundamental difference that each pixel contains a full lwir spectrum  consequently  chemical identification of the object can be performed without a need for an external light source such as the sun or the moon  such cameras are typically applied for geological measurements  outdoor surveillance and uav infrared photography  infrared filters are used to capture the near-infrared  spectrum  digital cameras often use infrared blockers  cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and can  see  intense near-infrared,  appearing as a bright purple-white  color  this is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near ir-bright  areas  such as near a lamp   where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image  there is also a technique called 't-ray'  imaging  which is imaging using far-infrared  or terahertz radiation  lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques  recently t-ray  imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as terahertz time-domain  spectroscopy infrared tracking  also known as infrared homing  refers to a passive missile guidance system  which uses the emission from a target of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it  missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as "heat-seekers",  since infrared  ir  is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies  many objects such as people  vehicle engines  and aircraft generate and retain heat  and as such  are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the radiation can be used as a deliberate heating source  for example  it is used in infrared saunas to heat the occupants  it may also be used in other heating applications  such as to remove ice from the wings of aircraft infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as it predominantly heats the opaque  absorbent objects  rather than the air around them infrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing processes  e g  curing of coatings  forming of plastics  annealing  plastic welding  and print drying  in these applications  infrared heaters replace convection ovens and contact heating efficiency is achieved by matching the wavelength of the infrared heater to the absorption characteristics of the material a variety of technologies or proposed technologies take advantage of infrared emissions to cool buildings or other systems  the lwir (8–15  µm  region is especially useful since some radiation at these wavelengths can escape into space through the atmosphere ir data transmission is also employed in short-range  communication among computer peripherals and personal digital assistants  these devices usually conform to standards published by irda  the infrared data association  remote controls and irda devices use infrared light-emitting  diodes  leds  to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow beam  the beam is modulated  i e  switched on and off  to prevent interference from other sources of infrared  like sunlight or artificial lighting   the receiver uses a silicon photodiode to convert the infrared radiation to an electric current  it responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter  and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light  infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density  ir does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms  infrared is the most common way for remote controls to command appliances  infrared remote control protocols like rc-5,  sirc  are used to communicate with infrared free space optical communication using infrared lasers can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at up to 4  gigabit s  compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable  except for the radiation damage   since the eye cannot detect ir  blinking or closing the eyes to help prevent or reduce damage may not lasers are used to provide the light for optical fiber communications systems  infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330  nm  least dispersion  or 1,550  nm  best transmission  are the best choices for standard silica fibers ir data transmission of encoded audio versions of printed signs is being researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the rias  remote infrared audible signage  project  transmitting ir data from one device to another is sometimes referred to as beaming infrared vibrational spectroscopy  see also near-infrared  spectroscopy  is a technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their constituent bonds  each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond  a group of atoms in a molecule  e g   ch2)  may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole  if an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency  the vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light  typically  the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000–400  cm−1,  the mid-infrared.  a spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded  this can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity  for example  a wet sample will show a broad o-h  absorption around 3200  cm−1).in  the semiconductor industry  infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures  by measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer  the index of refraction  n  and the extinction coefficient  k  can be determined via the forouhi-bloomer  dispersion equations  the reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension  depth  and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures weather satellites equipped with scanning radiometers produce thermal or infrared images  which can then enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types  to calculate land and surface water temperatures  and to locate ocean surface features  the scanning is typically in the range 10.3–12.5  µm (ir4  and ir5  channels  high  cold ice clouds such as cirrus or cumulonimbus show up bright white  lower warmer clouds such as stratus or stratocumulus show up as grey with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly  hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey  or black  one disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or fog can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up  however  using the difference in brightness of the ir4  channel (10.3–11.5  µm  and the near-infrared  channel (1.58–1.64  µm   low cloud can be distinguished  producing a fog satellite picture  the main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night  allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied these infrared pictures can depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the gulf stream  which are valuable to the shipping industry  fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea  even el niño phenomena can be spotted  using color-digitized  techniques  the gray-shaded  thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information the main water vapour channel at 6.40  to 7.08  µm can be imaged by some weather satellites and shows the amount of moisture in the atmosphere in the field of climatology  atmospheric infrared radiation is monitored to detect trends in the energy exchange between the earth and the atmosphere  these trends provide information on long-term  changes in earth s climate  it is one of the primary parameters studied in research into global warming  together with solar radiation a pyrgeometer is utilized in this field of research to perform continuous outdoor measurements  this is a broadband infrared radiometer with sensitivity for infrared radiation between approximately 4.5  µm and 50  µm astronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum using optical components  including mirrors  lenses and solid state digital detectors  for this reason it is classified as part of optical astronomy  to form an image  the components of an infrared telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources  and the detectors are chilled using liquid helium the sensitivity of earth-based  infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere  which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected atmospheric windows  this limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude  or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft  space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap  and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy the infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers  cold  dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars  infrared can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light  stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum  so nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily detected   in the visible light spectrum  the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet  infrared light is also useful for observing the cores of active galaxies  which are often cloaked in gas and dust  distant galaxies with a high redshift will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths  so they are more readily observed in the cleaning is a technique used by some motion picture film scanners  film scanners and flatbed scanners to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished scan  it works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels  red  green  and blue   the infrared channel  in combination with the other channels  is used to detect the location of scratches and dust  once located  those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by reflectography  fr  it  es   as called by art can be applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a completely non-destructive  manner  in particular the underdrawing or outline drawn by the artist as a guide  this often reveals the artist s use of carbon black  which shows up well in reflectograms  as long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting  art conservators are looking to see whether the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between – such alterations are called pentimenti when made by the original artist  this is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the prime version by the original artist or a copy  and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic  restoration work  in general  the more pentimenti the more likely a painting is to be the prime version  it also gives useful insights into working many other changes in the arnolfini portrait of 1434   left   the man s face was originally higher by about the height of his eye  the woman s was higher  and her eyes looked more to the front  each of his feet was underdrawn in one position  painted in another  and then overpainted in a third  these alterations are seen in infrared progress in the design of infrared sensitive cameras made it possible to discover and depict not only underpaintings and pentimenti but entire paintings which were later overpainted by the notable examples are picasso s  woman ironing  and  blue room   where in both cases  a portrait of a man has been made visible under the painting as it is known today similar uses of infrared are made by conservators and scientists on various types of objects  especially very old written documents such as the dead sea scrolls  the roman works in the villa of the papyri  and the silk road texts found in the dunhuang carbon black used in ink can show up extremely well the pit viper has a pair of infrared sensory pits on its head  there is uncertainty regarding the exact thermal sensitivity of this biological infrared detection organisms that have thermoreceptive organs are pythons  family pythonidae   some boas  family boidae   the common vampire bat  desmodus rotundus   a variety of jewel beetles  melanophila darkly pigmented butterflies  pachliopta aristolochiae and troides rhadamantus plateni   and possibly blood-sucking  bugs  triatoma near-infrared  vision (780–1000  nm  has long been deemed impossible due to noise in visual sensation of near-infrared  light was reported in the common carp and in three cichlid fish use nir to capture and for phototactic swimming nir sensation in fish may be relevant under poor lighting conditions during and in turbid surface light  or photobiomodulation  is used for treatment of chemotherapy-induced  oral ulceration as well as wound healing  there is some work relating to anti-herpes  virus research projects include work on central nervous system healing effects via cytochrome c oxidase upregulation and other possible infrared radiation in certain industry high-heat  settings may be hazardous to the eyes  resulting in damage or blindness to the user  since the radiation is invisible  special ir-proof  goggles must be worn in such discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to william herschel  the astronomer  in the early 19th  century  herschel published his results in 1800  before the royal society of london  herschel used a prism to refract light from the sun and detected the infrared  beyond the red part of the spectrum  through an increase in the temperature recorded on a thermometer  he was surprised at the result and called them  calorific rays   the term  infrared  did not appear until late in the 19th  important dates
