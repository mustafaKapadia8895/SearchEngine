 order of the british empire -  wikipediathe most excellent order of the british empire is a british order of chivalry  rewarding contributions to the arts and sciences  work with charitable and welfare organisations  and public service outside the civil it was established on 4  june 1917  by king george v  and comprises five classes across both civil and military divisions  the most senior two of which make the recipient either a knight if male or dame if there is also the related british empire medal  whose recipients are affiliated with  but not members of  the order recommendations for appointments to the order of the british empire were at first made on the nomination of the united kingdom  the self-governing  dominions of the empire  later commonwealth  and the viceroy of india  nominations continue today from commonwealth countries that participate in recommending british  imperial  honours  most commonwealth countries  such as india  pakistan  and nigeria  ceased recommendations for appointments to the order of the british empire when they created their own honours  some countries  such as canada and australia  were still recommending appointments to the order months or years after the creation of their own national orders of chivalry the five classes of appointment to the order are  in descending order of precedence the senior two ranks of knight or dame grand cross  and knight or dame commander  entitle their members to use the title of sir for men and dame for women before their forename  most members are citizens of the united kingdom or the commonwealth realms that use the imperial system of honours and awards honorary knighthoods are appointed to citizens of nations where the queen is not head of state  and may permit use of post-nominal  letters but not the title of sir or dame  occasionally  honorary appointees are  incorrectly  referred to as sir or dame – bob geldof  for example  honorary appointees who later become a citizen of a commonwealth realm can convert their appointment from honorary to substantive  then enjoy all privileges of membership of the order  including use of the title of sir and dame for the senior two ranks of the order  an example is irish broadcaster terry wogan  who was appointed an honorary knight commander of the order in 2005,  and on successful application for british citizenship  held alongside his irish citizenship  was made a substantive member and subsequently styled as sir terry george v founded the order to fill gaps in the british honours system in particular  king george v wished to create an order to honour many thousands of those who had served in a variety of non-combatant  roles during the first world war  when first established  the order had only one division  however  in 1918,  soon after its foundation  it was formally divided into military and civil the order s motto is for god and the the foundation of the order  the  medal of the order of the british empire  was instituted  to serve as a lower award granting recipients affiliation but not membership  in 1922,  this was renamed the  british empire medal   bem   it stopped being awarded by the united kingdom as part of the 1993  reforms to the honours system  but was again awarded beginning in 2012,  starting with 293  bems awarded for queen elizabeth ii s diamond in addition  the bem is awarded by the cook islands and by some other commonwealth nations  in 2004,  a report entitled  a matter of honour  reforming our honours system  by a commons committee recommended to phase out the order of the british empire  as its title was  now considered to be unacceptable  being thought to embody values that are no longer shared by many of the country s british monarch is sovereign of the order  and appoints all other members of the order  by convention  on the advice of the governments of the united kingdom and some commonwealth realms   the next most senior member is the grand master  of whom there have been three  prince edward  the prince of wales (1917–1936);  queen mary (1936–1953);  and the current grand master  the duke of edinburgh  since 1953).the  order is limited to 300  knights and dames grand cross  845  knights and dames commander  and 8,960  commanders  there are no limits applied to the total number of members of the fourth and fifth classes  but no more than 858  officers and 1,464  members may be appointed per year  foreign appointees  as honorary members  do not contribute to the numbers restricted to the order as full members do  although the order of the british empire has by far the highest number of members of the british orders of chivalry  with over 100,000  living members worldwide  there are fewer appointments to knighthoods than in other men can be knighted separately from an order of chivalry  women cannot  and so the rank of knight dame commander of the order is the lowest rank of damehood  and second-lowest  of knighthood  above knights bachelor   because of this  an appointment as dame commander is made in circumstances in which a man would be created a knight bachelor  for example  by convention  female judges of the high court of justice are created dames commander after appointment  while male judges become knights bachelor the order has six officials  the prelate  the dean  the secretary  the registrar  the king of arms  and the usher  the bishop of london  a senior bishop in the church of england  serves as the order s prelate  the dean of st paul s is ex officio the dean of the order  the order s king of arms is not a member of the college of arms  as are many other heraldic officers  the usher of the order is known as the gentleman usher of the purple rod  he does not – unlike his order of the garter equivalent  the gentleman usher of the black rod – perform any duties related to the house of lords from time to time  individuals are appointed to a higher grade within the order  thereby ceasing usage of the junior post-nominal  letters from 1940,  the sovereign could appoint a person as a commander  officer or member of the order of the british empire for gallantry for acts of bravery  not in the face of the enemy  below the level required for the george medal  the grade was determined by the same criteria as usual  and not by the level of gallantry  and with more junior people instead receiving the british empire medal   oddly  this meant that it was awarded for lesser acts of gallantry than the george medal  but  as an order  was worn before it and listed before it in post-nominal  initials  from 14  january 1958,  these awards were designated the order of the british empire for individual made a member of the order for gallantry could wear an emblem of two crossed silver oak leaves on the same riband  ribbon or bow as the badge  it could not be awarded posthumously  and was effectively replaced in 1974  with the queen s gallantry medal  qgm   if recipients of the order of the british empire for gallantry received promotion within the order  whether for gallantry or otherwise  they continued to wear also the insignia of the lower grade with the oak however  they only used the post-nominal  letters of the higher grade members of the order wear elaborate vestments on important occasions  such as quadrennial services and coronations   which vary by rank  the designs underwent major changes in 1937):mantle  worn by knights and dames grand cross (gbe)close-up  of the star on the mantlecollar and star of a knight or dame grand cross of the

commonwealth realms have established their own national system of honours and awards and have created their own unique orders  decorations and medals  canada seldom made recommendations for appointments to the order of the british empire except for the second world war and korea but continued to recommend gallantry awards for both military and civilians until after the creation of the order of australia continued to recommend the order of the british empire until the 1989  queen s birthday honours  nearly 15  years after the creation of the order of order has attracted some criticism for its naming having connection with the idea of the now-extinct  british benjamin zephaniah  a british jamaican poet  publicly rejected appointment as an officer in 2003  because  he asserted  it reminded him of  thousands of years of brutality   he also said that  it reminds me of how my foremothers were raped and my forefathers 2004,  a house of commons select committee recommended changing the name of the award to the order of british excellence  and changing the rank of commander to companion  as the former was said to have a  militaristic notable person to decline the offer of membership was the author c  s  lewis (1898–1963),  who had been named on the last list of honours by george vi in december 1951.  despite being a monarchist  he declined so as to avoid association with any political members of the beatles were appointed as members in 1965.  john lennon justified the comparative merits of his investiture by comparing military membership in the order   lots of people who complained about us receiving the mbe received theirs for heroism in the war – for killing people     we received ours for entertaining other people  i d say we deserve ours more   lennon later returned his mbe insignia on 25  november 1969,  as part of his ongoing peace other criticism centres on the claim that many recipients of the order are being rewarded with honours for simply doing their jobs  critics claim that the civil service and judiciary receive far more orders and honours than leaders of other peng  long-time  leader of the malayan communist party  was
