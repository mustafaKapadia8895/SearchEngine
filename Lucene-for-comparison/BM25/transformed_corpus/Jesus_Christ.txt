 jesus -    ˈdʒiːzəs  jee-zuss;  c  4  bc – c  30/33  ad   also referred to as jesus of nazareth and jesus was a jewish preacher and religious who is the central figure of christianity  christians believe him to be the son of god and the awaited messiah  christ  prophesied in the old all modern scholars of antiquity agree that jesus existed although the quest for the historical jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the gospels and on how closely the biblical jesus reflects the historical jesus was a galilean who was baptized by john the baptist and subsequently began his own ministry  preaching his message and often being referred to as jesus debated fellow jews on how to best follow god  engaged in healings  taught in parables and gathered he was arrested and tried by the jewish and turned over to the roman government  and was subsequently crucified on the order of pontius pilate  the roman after his death  his followers believed he rose from the dead  and the community they formed eventually became the christian birth is celebrated annually on december 25   or various dates in january for some eastern churches  as a holiday known as christmas  his crucifixion is honored on good friday  and his resurrection is celebrated on easter  the widely used calendar era  ad   from the latin anno domini   in the year of the lord    and the alternative  ce   are based on the approximate birth date of doctrines include the beliefs that jesus was conceived by the holy spirit  was born of a virgin named mary  performed miracles  founded the church  died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement  rose from the dead  and ascended into heaven  from where he will most christians believe jesus enables humans to be reconciled to god  the nicene creed asserts that jesus will judge the living and the either before or after their bodily an event tied to the second coming of jesus in christian the great majority of christians worship jesus as the incarnation of god the son  the second of three persons of a divine trinity  a minority of christian denominations reject trinitarianism  wholly or partly  as non-scriptural.in  islam  jesus  commonly transliterated as isa  is considered one of god s important prophets and the muslims believe jesus was a bringer of scripture and was born of a virgin but was not the son of god  the quran states that jesus himself never claimed to most muslims  jesus was not crucified but was physically raised into heaven by god judaism rejects the belief that jesus was the awaited messiah  arguing that he did not fulfill messianic prophecies and asserting that his resurrection is a christian typical jew in jesus  time had only one name  sometimes supplemented with the father s name or the individual s thus  in the new testament  jesus is commonly referred to as  jesus of  e g   mark jesus  neighbors in nazareth refer to him as  the carpenter  the son of mary and brother of james and joses and judas and simon   mark  the carpenter s son   matthew or  joseph s son   luke in john  the disciple philip refers to him as  jesus son of joseph from nazareth   john name jesus is derived from the latin iesus  a transliteration of the greek ἰησοῦς the greek form is a rendering of the hebrew ישוע‎  yeshua   a variant of the earlier name יהושע‎  yehoshua   in english the name yeshua appears to have been in use in judea at the time of the birth of the 1st  century works of historian flavius josephus  who wrote in koine greek  the same language as that of the new refer to at least twenty different people with the name jesus  i e  the etymology of jesus  name in the context of the new testament is generally given as  yahweh is early christianity  christians have commonly referred to jesus as  jesus the word christ is derived from the greek χριστός which is a translation of the hebrew משיח  meshiakh   meaning the  anointed  and usually transliterated into english as christians designate jesus as christ because they believe he is the messiah  whose arrival is prophesied in the hebrew bible and old testament  in postbiblical usage  christ became viewed as a name—one part of  jesus christ —but originally it was a the term  christian   meaning a follower of christ  has been in use since the 1st  christianity biblethe four canonical gospels  matthew  mark  luke  and john  are the foremost sources for the life and message of however  other parts of the new testament also include references to key episodes in his life  such as the last supper in 1  corinthians acts of the apostles  acts 10:37–38  and acts 19)  refers to the early ministry of jesus and its anticipation by john the acts 1:1–11  says more about the ascension of jesus  also mentioned in 1  timothy 3:16)  than the canonical gospels in the undisputed pauline letters  which were written earlier than the gospels  the words or instructions of jesus are cited several times (1  corinthians 7:10–11,  9:14,  11:23–25,  2  corinthians early christian groups had separate descriptions of the life and teachings of jesus that are not included in the new testament  these include the gospels of thomas  peter  and judas  the apocryphon of james  and many other apocryphal writings  most scholars conclude that these are written much later and are less reliable accounts than the canonical canonical gospels are four accounts  each written by a different author  the authors of the gospels are all anonymous  attributed by tradition to the four evangelists  each with close ties to mark by john mark  an associate of matthew by one of jesus  luke by a companion of paul mentioned in a few and john by another of jesus  the  beloved important aspect of the study of the gospels is the literary genre under which they fall  genre  is a key convention guiding both the composition and the interpretation of whether the gospel authors set out to write novels  myths  histories  or biographies has a tremendous impact on how they ought to be interpreted  some recent studies suggest that the genre of the gospels ought to be situated within the realm of ancient although not without the position that the gospels are a type of ancient biography is the consensus among scholars everything contained in the new testament gospels is considered to be historically views range from their being inerrant descriptions of the life of to their providing little historical information about his life beyond the according to a broad scholarly consensus  the synoptic gospels  matthew  mark  and luke   and not john  are the most reliable sources of information about to the marcan priority  the first to be written was the gospel of mark  written ad 60–75),  followed by the gospel of matthew  ad 65–85),  the gospel of luke  ad 65–95),  and the gospel of john  ad furthermore  most scholars agree that the authors of matthew and luke used mark as a source when writing their gospels  matthew and luke also share some content not found in mark  to explain this  many scholars believe that in addition to mark  another source  commonly called the  q source   was used by the two mark  and luke are known as the synoptic gospels  from the greek σύν  syn  together   and ὄψις  opsis they are similar in content  narrative arrangement  language and paragraph scholars generally agree that it is impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the synoptic gospels and the gospel of while the flow of some events  such as jesus  baptism  transfiguration  crucifixion and interactions with the apostles  are shared among the synoptic gospels  incidents such as the transfiguration do not appear in john  which also differs on other matters  such as the cleansing of the synoptics emphasize different aspects of jesus  in mark  jesus is the son of god whose mighty works demonstrate the presence of god s he is a tireless wonder worker  the servant of both god and this short gospel records few of jesus  words or the gospel of matthew emphasizes that jesus is the fulfillment of god s will as revealed in the old testament  and he is the lord of the he is the  son of david   a  king   and the luke presents jesus as the divine-human  savior who shows compassion to the he is the friend of sinners and outcasts  come to seek and save the this gospel includes jesus  most beloved parables  such as the good samaritan and the prodigal prologue to the gospel of john identifies jesus as an incarnation of the divine word as the word  jesus was eternally present with god  active in all creation  and the source of humanity s moral and spiritual jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be  he not only speaks god s word  he is god s in the gospel of john  jesus reveals his divine role publicly  here he is the bread of life  the light of the world  the true vine and general  the authors of the new testament showed little interest in an absolute chronology of jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the as stated in john 21:25,  the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of the accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early christianity  with timelines as a secondary in this respect  it is noteworthy that the gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of the life of jesus in jerusalem  referred to as the although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates  it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of was born by mary  wife of joseph  matthew 1,  luke 2).  matthew and luke each offer a genealogy of jesus  matthew traces jesus  ancestry to abraham through luke traces jesus  ancestry through adam to the lists are identical between abraham and david  but differ radically from that point matthew and luke each describe jesus  nativity  or birth   especially that jesus was born by a virgin mary in bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy  luke s account emphasizes events before the birth of jesus and centers on mary  while matthew s mostly covers those after the birth and centers on both accounts state that jesus was born to joseph and mary  his betrothed  in bethlehem  and both support the doctrine of the virgin birth of jesus  according to which jesus was miraculously conceived by the holy spirit in mary s womb when she was still a matthew  joseph is troubled because mary  his betrothed  is pregnant  matthew 1:19–20),  but in the first of joseph s three dreams an angel assures him not to be afraid to take mary as his wife  because her child was conceived by the holy in matthew 2:1–12,  wise men or magi from the east bring gifts to the young jesus as the king of the jews  herod the great hears of jesus  birth and  wanting him killed  orders the murders of male infants in bethlehem  but an angel warns joseph in his second dream  and the family flees to egypt—later to return and settle in luke 1:31–38,  mary learns from the angel gabriel that she will conceive and bear a child called jesus through the action of the holy when mary is due to give birth  she and joseph travel from nazareth to joseph s ancestral home in bethlehem to register in the census ordered by caesar augustus  while there mary gives birth to jesus  and as they have found no room in the inn  she places the newborn in a manger  luke 2:1–7).  an angel announces the birth to some shepherds  who go to bethlehem to see jesus  and subsequently spread the news abroad  luke 2:8-20).  after the presentation of jesus at the temple  joseph  mary and jesus return to childhood home is identified in the gospels of luke and matthew as the town of nazareth in galilee  where he lived with his family  although joseph appears in descriptions of jesus  childhood  no mention is made of him his other family members—his mother  mary  his brothers james  joses  or joseph   judas and simon and his unnamed sisters—are mentioned in the gospels and other gospel of mark reports that jesus comes into conflict with his neighbors and jesus  mother and brothers come to get him  mark 3:31–35)  because people are saying that he is crazy  mark 3:21).  jesus responds that his followers are his true family  in john  mary follows jesus to his crucifixion  and he expresses concern over her well-being   john 19:25–27).jesus  is called a τέκτων  tektōn  in mark 6:3,  traditionally understood as carpenter but could cover makers of objects in various materials  including the gospels indicate that jesus could read  paraphrase  and debate scripture  but this does not necessarily mean that he received formal scribal jesus is presented in the temple per jewish law  a man named simeon says to mary and joseph that jesus  shall stand as a sign of contradiction  while a sword will pierce your own soul  then the secret thoughts of many will come to light   luke 2:28–35).  when jesus goes missing  they find him in the temple sitting among the teachers  listening to them and asking questions  and the people are amazed at his understanding and answers  mary scolds jesus for going missing  to which jesus replies that he must  be in his father s house   luke 2:41–52).the  synoptic accounts of jesus  baptism are all preceded by information about john the they show john preaching penance and repentance for the remission of sins and encouraging the giving of alms to the poor  luke 3:11)  as he baptizes people in the area of the jordan river around perea and foretells  luke 3:16)  the arrival of someone  more powerful  than later  jesus identifies john as  the elijah who was to come   matthew 11:14,  mark 9:13–14),  the prophet who was expected to arrive before the  great and terrible day of the lord   malachi 4:5).  likewise  luke says that john had the spirit and power of elijah  luke 1:17).in  mark  john baptizes jesus  and as he comes out of the water he sees the holy spirit descending to him like a dove and he hears a voice from heaven declaring him to be god s son  mark 1:9-11).  this is one of two events described in the gospels where a voice from heaven calls jesus  son   the other being the the spirit then drives him into the wilderness where he is tempted by satan  mark 1:12–13).  jesus then begins his ministry after john s arrest  mark 1:14).  jesus  baptism in matthew is similar  here  before jesus  baptism  john protests  saying   i need to be baptized by you   matthew 3:14).  jesus instructs him to carry on with the baptism  to fulfill all righteousness   matthew 3:15).  matthew also details the three temptations that satan offers jesus in the wilderness  matthew 4:3–11).  in luke  the holy spirit descends as a dove after everyone has been baptized and jesus is praying  luke 3:21-22).  john implicitly recognizes jesus from prison after sending his followers to ask about him luke 7:18–23).  jesus  baptism and temptation serve as preparation for his public gospel of john leaves out jesus  baptism and here  john the baptist testifies that he saw the spirit descend on jesus john john publicly proclaims jesus as the sacrificial lamb of god  and some of john s followers become disciples of in this gospel  john denies that he is elijah john 1:21).  before john is imprisoned  jesus leads his followers to baptize disciples as well  john 3:22–24),  and they baptize more people than john  john 4:1).the  synoptics depict two distinct geographical settings in jesus  ministry  the first takes place north of judea  in galilee  where jesus conducts a successful ministry  and the second shows jesus rejected and killed when he travels to often referred to as jesus preaches his message notably  jesus forbids those who recognize him as the messiah to speak of it  including people he heals and demons he exorcises  see messianic depicts jesus  ministry as largely taking place in and around jerusalem  rather than in galilee  and jesus  divine identity is openly proclaimed and immediately divide the ministry of jesus into several stages  the galilean ministry begins when jesus returns to galilee from the judaean desert after rebuffing the temptation of satan  jesus preaches around galilee  and in matthew 4:18–20,  his first disciples  who will eventually form the core of the early church  encounter him and begin to travel with this period includes the sermon on the mount  one of jesus  major as well as the calming of the storm  the feeding of the 5,000,  walking on water and a number of other miracles and it ends with the confession of peter and the jesus travels towards jerusalem  in the perean ministry  he returns to the area where he was baptized  about a third of the way down from the sea of galilee along the jordan river  john the final ministry in jerusalem begins with jesus  triumphal entry into the city on palm in the synoptic gospels  during that week jesus drives the money changers from the second temple and judas bargains to betray him  this period culminates in the last supper and the farewell the beginning of his ministry  jesus appoints twelve apostles  in matthew and mark  despite jesus only briefly requesting that they join him  jesus  first four apostles  who were fishermen  are described as immediately consenting  and abandoning their nets and boats to do so  matthew 4:18–22,  mark 1:16–20).  in john  jesus  first two apostles were disciples of john the baptist  the baptist sees jesus and calls him the lamb of god  the two hear this and follow in addition to the twelve apostles  the opening of the passage of the sermon on the plain identifies a much larger group of people as disciples  luke 6:17).  also  in luke 10:1–16  jesus sends seventy or seventy-two  of his followers in pairs to prepare towns for his prospective visit  they are instructed to accept hospitality  heal the sick and spread the word that the kingdom of god is mark  the disciples are notably obtuse  they fail to understand jesus  miracles  mark 4:35–41,  mark 6:52),  his parables  mark 4:13),  or what  rising from the dead  would mean  mark 9:9–10).  when jesus is later arrested  they desert the synoptics  jesus teaches extensively  often in about the kingdom of god  or  in matthew  the kingdom of heaven   the kingdom is described as both imminent  mark 1:15)  and already present in the ministry of jesus  luke 17:21).  jesus promises inclusion in the kingdom for those who accept his message  mark 10:13–27).  jesus talks of the  son of man   an apocalyptic figure who would come to gather the calls people to repent their sins and to devote themselves completely to jesus tells his followers to adhere to jewish law  although he is perceived by some to have broken the law himself  for example regarding the when asked what the greatest commandment is  jesus replies   you shall love the lord your god with all your heart  and with all your soul  and with all your mind     and a second is like it   you shall love your neighbor as yourself   matthew 22:37–39).  other ethical teachings of jesus include loving your enemies  refraining from hatred and lust  turning the other cheek  and forgiving people who have sinned against you  matthew gospel presents the teachings of jesus not merely as his own preaching  but as divine revelation  john the baptist  for example  states in john 3:34:   he whom god has sent speaks the words of god  for he gives the spirit without measure   in john 7:16  jesus says   my teaching is not mine but his who sent me   he asserts the same thing in john 14:10:   do you not believe that i am in the father and the father is in me  the words that i say to you i do not speak on my own  but the father who dwells in me does his thirty parables form about one third of jesus  recorded the parables appear within longer sermons and at other places in the they often contain symbolism  and usually relate the physical world to the common themes in these tales include the kindness and generosity of god and the perils of some of his parables  such as the prodigal son  luke 15:11–32),  are relatively simple  while others  such as the growing seed  mark 4:26–29),  are sophisticated  profound and when asked by his disciples about why he speaks in parables to the people  jesus replies that the chosen disciples have been given to  know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven   unlike the rest of their people   for the one who has will be given more and he will have in abundance  but the one who does not have will be deprived even more    going on to say that the majority of their generation have grown  dull hearts  and thus are unable to understand  matthew 13:10–17).in  the gospel accounts  jesus devotes a large portion of his ministry performing miracles  especially the miracles can be classified into two main categories  healing miracles and nature the healing miracles include cures for physical ailments  and resurrections of the the nature miracles show jesus  power over nature  and include turning water into wine  walking on water  and calming a storm  among others  jesus states that his miracles are from a divine source  when jesus  opponents suddenly accuse him of performing exorcisms by the power of beelzebul  the prince of demons  jesus counters that he performs them by the  spirit of god   matthew 12:28)  or  finger of god   arguing that all logic suggests that satan would not let his demons assist the children of god because it would divide satan s house and bring his kingdom to desolation  furthermore  he asks his opponents that if he exorcises by beel zebub   by whom do your sons cast them out   luke in matthew 12:31–32,  he goes on to say that while all manner of sin   even insults against god  or  insults against the son of man   shall be forgiven  whoever insults goodness  or  the holy spirit   shall never be forgiven  he she carries the guilt of his her sin forever in john  jesus  miracles are described as  signs   performed to prove his mission and however  in the synoptics  when asked by some teachers of the law and some pharisees to give miraculous signs to prove his authority  jesus saying that no sign shall come to corrupt and evil people except the sign of the prophet jonah  also  in the synoptic gospels  the crowds regularly respond to jesus  miracles with awe and press on him to heal their sick  in john s gospel  jesus is presented as unpressured by the crowds  who often respond to his miracles with trust and one characteristic shared among all miracles of jesus in the gospel accounts is that he performed them freely and never requested or accepted any form of the gospel episodes that include descriptions of the miracles of jesus also often include teachings  and the miracles themselves involve an element of many of the miracles teach the importance of faith  in the cleansing of ten lepers and the raising of jairus  daughter  for instance  the beneficiaries are told that their healing was due to their about the middle of each of the three synoptic gospels are two significant events  the confession of peter and the transfiguration of these two events are not mentioned in the gospel of his confession  peter tells jesus   you are the messiah  the son of the living jesus affirms that peter s confession is divinely revealed after the confession  jesus tells his disciples about his upcoming death and resurrection  matthew 16:21,  mark 8:31,  luke 9:22)in  the transfiguration  matthew 17:1–9,  mark 9:2–8,  and luke jesus takes peter and two other apostles up an unnamed mountain  where  he was transfigured before them  and his face shone like the sun  and his clothes became dazzling a bright cloud appears around them  and a voice from the cloud says   this is my son  the beloved  with him i am well pleased  listen to him   matthew description of the last week of the life of jesus  often called passion week  occupies about one third of the narrative in the canonical starting with jesus  triumphal entry into jerusalem and ending with his the synoptics  the last week in jerusalem is the conclusion of the journey through perea and judea that jesus began in jesus rides a young donkey into jerusalem  reflecting the tale of the messiah s donkey  an oracle from the book of zechariah in which the jews  humble king enters jerusalem this way  zechariah people along the way lay cloaks and small branches of trees  known as palm fronds  in front of him and sing part of psalms next expels the money changers from the second temple  accusing them of turning it into a den of thieves through their commercial activities  jesus then prophesies about the coming destruction  including false prophets  wars  earthquakes  celestial disorders  persecution of the faithful  the appearance of an  abomination of desolation   and unendurable tribulations  mark 13:1–23).  the mysterious  son of man   he says  will dispatch angels to gather the faithful from all parts of the earth  mark 13:24–27).  jesus warns that these wonders will occur in the lifetimes of the hearers  mark in john  the cleansing of the temple occurs at the beginning of jesus  ministry instead of at the end  john comes into conflict with the jewish elders  such as when they question his authority and when he criticizes them and calls them judas iscariot  one of the twelve apostles  secretly strikes a bargain with the jewish elders  agreeing to betray jesus to them for 30  silver gospel of john recounts of two other feasts in which jesus taught in jerusalem before the passion week  john in bethany  a village near jerusalem  jesus raises lazarus from the dead  this potent increases the tension with who conspire to kill him  john mary of bethany anoints jesus  feet  foreshadowing his jesus then makes his messianic entry into the cheering crowds greeting jesus as he enters jerusalem add to the animosity between him and the in john  jesus has already cleansed the second temple during an earlier passover visit to jerusalem  john next recounts jesus  last supper with his last supper is the final meal that jesus shares with his 12  apostles in jerusalem before his crucifixion  the last supper is mentioned in all four canonical gospels  paul s first epistle to the corinthians (11:23–26)  also refers to during the meal  jesus predicts that one of his apostles will betray despite each apostle s assertion that he would not betray him  jesus reiterates that the betrayer would be one of those present  matthew 26:23–25  and john 13:26–27  specifically identify judas as the the synoptics  jesus takes bread  breaks it  and gives it to the disciples  saying   this is my body  which is given for you   he then has them all drink from a cup  saying   this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood   luke the christian sacrament or ordinance of the eucharist is based on these although the gospel of john does not include a description of the bread-and-wine  ritual during the last supper  most scholars agree that john 6:22–59   the bread of life discourse  has a eucharistic character and resonates with the institution narratives in the synoptic gospels and in the pauline writings on the last all four gospels  jesus predicts that peter will deny knowledge of him three times before the rooster crows the next in luke and john  the prediction is made during the supper  luke 22:34,  john 22:34).  in matthew and mark  the prediction is made after the supper  jesus also predicts that all his disciples will desert him  matthew 26:31–34,  mark the gospel of john provides the only account of jesus washing his disciples  feet after the john also includes a long sermon by jesus  preparing his disciples  now without judas  for his departure  chapters 14–17  of the gospel of john are known as the farewell discourse and are a significant source of christological the synoptics  jesus and his disciples go to the garden gethsemane  where jesus prays to be spared his coming ordeal  then judas comes with an armed mob  sent by the chief priests  scribes and elders  he kisses jesus to identify him to the crowd  which then arrests jesus  in an attempt to stop them  an unnamed disciple of jesus uses a sword to cut off the ear of a man in the crowd  after jesus  arrest  his disciples go into hiding  and peter  when questioned  thrice denies knowing jesus  after the third denial  peter hears the rooster crow and recalls jesus  prediction about his denial  peter then weeps john (18:1–11),  jesus does not pray to be spared his crucifixion  as the gospel portrays him as scarcely touched by such human the people who arrest him are roman soldiers and temple instead of being betrayed by a kiss  jesus proclaims his identity  and when he does  the soldiers and officers fall to the ground  the gospel identifies peter as the disciple who used the sword  and jesus rebukes him for it after his arrest  jesus is taken to the sanhedrin  a jewish judicial the gospel accounts differ on the details of the in matthew 26:57,  mark 14:53  and luke 22:54,  jesus is taken to the house of the high priest  caiaphas  where he is mocked and beaten that night  early the next morning  the chief priests and scribes lead jesus away into their john 18:12–14  states that jesus is first taken to annas  caiaphas  father-in-law,  and then to the high the trials jesus speaks very little  mounts no defense  and gives very infrequent and indirect answers to the priests  questions  prompting an officer to slap him  in matthew 26:62  jesus  unresponsiveness leads caiaphas to ask him   have you no in mark 14:61  the high priest then asks jesus   are you the messiah  the son of the blessed one   jesus replies   i am   and then predicts the coming of the son of this provokes caiaphas to tear his own robe in anger and to accuse jesus of blasphemy  in matthew and luke  jesus  answer is more in matthew 26:64  he responds   you have said so   and in luke 22:70  he says   you say that i take jesus to pilate s court  but pontius pilate  the prefect of judaea  proves extremely reluctant to condemn jesus  according to robert w  funk  it is the jewish elders who are to blame for jesus  augustine of hippo says that pilate was not free from blame  since he exercised his power to execute the jewish elders ask the roman governor pontius pilate to judge and condemn jesus  accusing him of claiming to be the king of the the use of the word  king  is central to the discussion between jesus and pilate  in john 18:36  jesus states   my kingdom is not from this world   but he does not unequivocally deny being the king of the in luke 23:7–15  pilate realizes that jesus is a galilean  and thus comes under the jurisdiction of herod antipas  the tetrarch of galilee and pilate sends jesus to herod to be but jesus says almost nothing in response to herod s questions  herod and his soldiers mock jesus  put an expensive robe on him to make him look like a king  and return him to who then calls together the jewish elders and announces that he has  not found this man a passover custom of the time  pilate allows one prisoner chosen by the crowd to be released  he gives the people a choice between jesus and a murderer called barabbas  persuaded by the elders  matthew 27:20),  the mob chooses to release barabbas and crucify pilate writes a sign in hebrew  latin  and greek that reads  jesus of nazareth  the king of the jews   abbreviated as inri in depictions  to be affixed to jesus  cross  john then scourges jesus and sends him to be crucified  the soldiers place a crown of thorns on jesus  head and ridicule him as the king of the jews  they beat and taunt him before taking him to also called golgotha  for crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels  after the trials  jesus is led to calvary carrying his cross  the route traditionally thought to have been taken is known as the via dolorosa  the three synoptic gospels indicate that simon of cyrene assists him  having been compelled by the romans to do in luke 23:27–28  jesus tells the women in the multitude of people following him not to weep for him but for themselves and their at calvary  jesus is offered a concoction usually offered as a painkiller  according to matthew and mark  he refuses soldiers then crucify jesus and cast lots for his clothes  above jesus  head on the cross is pilate s inscription   jesus of nazareth  the king of the jews   soldiers and passersby mock him about it  two convicted thieves are crucified along with jesus  in matthew and mark  both thieves mock jesus  in luke  one of them rebukes jesus  while the other defends jesus tells the latter   today you will be with me in paradise   luke 23:43).  in john  mary  the mother of jesus  and the beloved disciple were at the crucifixion  jesus tells the beloved disciple to take of his mother  john 19:26–27).the  roman soldiers break the two thieves  legs  a procedure designed to hasten death in a crucifixion   but they do not break those of jesus  as he is already dead  john 19:33).  in john 19:34,  one soldier pierces jesus  side with a lance  and blood and water flow in the synoptics  when jesus dies  the heavy curtain at the temple is torn  in matthew 27:51–54,  an earthquake breaks open tombs  in matthew and mark  terrified by the events  a roman centurion states that jesus was the son of the same day  joseph of arimathea  with pilate s permission and with nicodemus  help  removes jesus  body from the cross  wraps him in a clean cloth  and

large stone covering the magdalene  alone in john  but accompanied by other women in the synoptics  goes to jesus  tomb on sunday morning and is surprised to find it empty  despite jesus  teaching  the disciples had not understood that jesus would rise ascension into heaven is described in luke 24:50–53,  acts 1:1–11  and mentioned in 1  timothy 3:16.  in the acts of the apostles  forty days after the resurrection  as the disciples look on   he was lifted up  and a cloud took him out of their sight   1  peter 3:22  states that jesus has  gone into heaven and is at the right hand of acts of the apostles describes several appearances of jesus after his ascension  in acts 7:55,  stephen gazes into heaven and sees  jesus standing at the right hand of god  just before his on the road to

ananias of damascus in a vision to heal the book of revelation includes a revelation from jesus concerning the last to the enlightenment  the gospels were usually regarded as accurate historical accounts  but since then scholars have emerged who question the reliability of the gospels and draw a distinction between the jesus described in the gospels and the jesus of since the 18th  century  three separate scholarly quests for the historical jesus have taken place  each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria  which were often developed during the quest that applied while there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of and a basic consensus on the general outline of his the portraits of jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other  and from the image portrayed in the gospel to the historical reconstruction of the life of jesus have varied from the  maximalist  approaches of the 19th  century  in which the gospel accounts were accepted as reliable evidence wherever it is possible  to the  minimalist  approaches of the early 20th  century  where hardly anything about jesus was accepted as in the 1950s,  as the second quest for the historical jesus gathered pace  the minimalist approaches faded away  and in the 21st  century  minimalists such as price are a very small although a belief in the inerrancy of the gospels cannot be supported historically  many scholars since the 1980s  have held that  beyond the few facts considered to be historically certain  certain other elements of jesus  life are  historically modern scholarly research on the historical jesus thus focuses on identifying the most probable ad 6,  judea  idumea  and samaria were transformed from a client kingdom of the roman empire into an imperial province  also called judea  a roman prefect  rather than a client king  ruled the land  the prefect ruled from caesarea maritima  leaving jerusalem to be run by the high priest of israel  as an exception  the prefect came to jerusalem during religious festivals  when religious and patriotic enthusiasm sometimes inspired unrest or uprisings  gentile lands surrounded the jewish territories of judea and galilee  but roman law and practice allowed jews to remain separate legally and culturally  galilee was evidently prosperous  and poverty was limited enough that it did not threaten the social religion was unusual in that jews acknowledged only one god  they considered themselves chosen by him  and they wanted gentiles to accept their god as the only god  jews based their faith and religious practice on the torah  five books said to have been given by god to moses  the three prominent religious parties were the pharisees  the essenes  and the sadducees  together these parties represented only a small fraction of the population  most jews looked forward to a time that god would deliver them from their pagan rulers  possibly through war against the testament scholars face a formidable challenge when they analyze the canonical the gospels are not biographies in the modern sense  and the authors explain jesus  theological significance and recount his public ministry while omitting many details of his the reports of supernatural events associated with jesus  death and resurrection make the challenge even more scholars regard the gospels as compromised sources of information because the writers were trying to glorify even so  the sources for jesus  life are better than sources scholars have for the life of alexander the scholars use a number of criteria  such as the criterion of independent attestation  the criterion of coherence  and the criterion of discontinuity to judge the historicity of the historicity of an event also depends on the reliability of the source  indeed  the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of jesus  life  mark  which is most likely the earliest written gospel  has been considered for many decades the most historically john  the latest written gospel  differs considerably from the synoptic gospels  and thus is generally considered less reliable  although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the synoptic tradition or even more non-canonical  gospel of thomas might be an independent witness to many of jesus  parables and aphorisms  for example  thomas confirms that jesus blessed the poor and that this saying circulated independently before being combined with similar sayings in the q other select non-canonical  christian texts may also have value for historical jesus non-christian  sources that attest to the historical existence of jesus include the works of the historians josephus and josephus scholar louis feldman has stated that  few have doubted the genuineness  of josephus  reference to jesus in book 20  of the antiquities of the jews  and it is disputed only by a small number of tacitus referred to christ and his execution by pilate in book 15  of his work annals  scholars generally consider tacitus s reference to the execution of jesus to be both authentic and of historical value as an independent roman sources are valuable in two ways  first  they show that even neutral or hostile parties never evince any doubt that jesus actually existed  second  they present a rough picture of jesus that is compatible with that found in the christian sources  that jesus was a teacher  had a reputation as a miracle worker  had a brother james  and died a violent helps scholars better understand jesus  social recent archeological work  for example  indicates that capernaum  a city important in jesus  ministry  was poor and small  without even a forum or an this archaeological discovery resonates well with the scholarly view that jesus advocated reciprocal sharing among the destitute in that area of was a galilean born around the beginning of the 1st  century  who died in 30  or 33  ad in the general scholarly consensus is that jesus was a contemporary of john the baptist and was crucified by the roman governor pontius pilate  who held office from 26  to 36  gospels offer several clues concerning the year of jesus  birth  matthew 2:1  associates the birth of jesus with the reign of herod the great  who died around 4  bc  and luke 1:5  mentions that herod was on the throne shortly before the birth of although this gospel also associates the birth with the census of quirinius which took place ten years luke 3:23  states that jesus was  about thirty years old  at the start of his ministry  which according to acts 10:37–38  was preceded by john the baptist s ministry  itself recorded in luke 3:1–2  to have begun in the 15th  year of tiberius  reign (28  or 29  by collating the gospel accounts with historical data and using various other methods  most scholars arrive at a date of birth between 6  and 4  bc for but some propose estimates that lie in a wider years of jesus  ministry have been estimated using several different one of these applies the reference in luke 3:1–2,  acts 10:37–38  and the dates of tiberius  reign  which are well known  to give a date of around 28–29  ad for the start of jesus  another approach uses the statement about the temple in john 2:13–20,  which asserts that the temple in jerusalem was in its 46th  year of construction at the start of jesus  ministry  together with josephus  statement that the temple s reconstruction was started by herod the great in the 18th  year of his reign  to estimate a date around 27–29  a further method uses the date of the death of john the baptist and the marriage of herod antipas to herodias  based on the writings of josephus  and correlates it with matthew 14:4  and mark given that most scholars date the marriage of herod and herodias as ad 28–35,  this yields a date about 28–29  number of approaches have been used to estimate the year of the crucifixion of jesus  most scholars agree that he died in 30  or 33  the gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of pilate  the roman governor of judea from 26  to 36  the date for the conversion of paul  estimated to be 33–36  ad  acts as an upper bound for the date of crucifixion  the dates for paul s conversion and ministry can be determined by analyzing the pauline epistles and the acts of the astronomers have tried to estimate the precise date of the crucifixion by analyzing lunar motion and calculating historic dates of passover  a festival based on the lunisolar hebrew calendar  the most widely accepted dates derived from this method are april 7,  30  ad  and april 3,  33  ad  both have reached a limited consensus on the basics of jesus  scholars agree that joseph  jesus  father  died by the time jesus began his ministry  joseph is not mentioned at all in the gospels during jesus  ministry  joseph s death would explain why in mark 6:3,  jesus  neighbors refer to jesus as the  son of mary   sons were usually identified by their to theissen and merz  it is common for extraordinary charismatic leaders  such as jesus  to come into conflict with their ordinary in mark  jesus  family comes to get him  fearing that he is mad  mark 3:20–34),  and this account is likely historical because early christians would not have invented after jesus  death  many members of his family joined the christian jesus  brother james became a leader of the jerusalem vermes says that the doctrine of the virgin birth of jesus arose from theological development rather than from historical despite the widely held view that the authors of the synoptic gospels drew upon each other  the so-called  synoptic problem   other scholars take it as significant that the virgin birth is attested by two separate gospels  matthew and to e  p  sanders  the birth narratives in matthew and luke are the clearest case of invention in the gospel narratives of jesus  life  both accounts have jesus born in bethlehem  in accordance with jewish salvation history  and both have him growing up in nazareth  but sanders points that the two gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened  luke s account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible  matthew s account is more plausible  but the story reads as though it was invented to identify jesus as like a new moses  and the historian josephus reports herod the great s brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little says that the genealogies of jesus are based not on historical information but on the authors  desire to show that jesus was the universal jewish in any event  once the doctrine of the virgin birth of jesus became established  that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from david through luke reports that jesus was a blood relation of john the baptist  but scholars generally consider this connection to be modern scholars consider jesus  baptism to be a definite historical fact  along with his theologian james d g  dunn states that they  command almost universal assent  and  rank so high on the  almost impossible to doubt or deny  scale of historical facts  that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical scholars adduce the criterion of embarrassment  saying that early christians would not have invented a baptism that might imply that jesus committed sins and wanted to according to theissen and merz  jesus was inspired by john the baptist and took over from him many elements of his scholars hold that jesus lived in galilee and judea and did not preach or study they agree that jesus debated with jewish authorities on the subject of god  performed some healings  taught in parables and gathered jesus  jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners  fraternized with women  and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the according to sanders  it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the law of moses and the sabbath would have led jewish authorities to want jesus to ehrman  jesus taught that a coming kingdom was everyone s proper focus  not anything in this he taught about the jewish law  seeking its true meaning  sometimes in opposition to other jesus put love at the center of the law  and following that law was an apocalyptic his ethical teachings called for forgiveness  not judging others  loving enemies  and caring for the funk and hoover note that typical of jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase  such as advising one  when struck on the cheek  to offer the other cheek to be struck as well  luke gospels portray jesus teaching in well-defined  sessions  such as matthew s sermon on the mount or luke s parallel sermon on the plain  according to gerd theissen and annette merz  these teaching sessions include authentic teachings of jesus  but the scenes were invented by the respective evangelists to frame these teachings  which had originally been recorded without while jesus  miracles fit within the social context of antiquity  he defined them differently  first  he attributed them to the faith of those healed  second  he connected them to end times chose twelve disciples  the  twelve    evidently as an apocalyptic all three synoptics mention the twelve  although the names on luke s list vary from those in mark and matthew  suggesting that christians were not certain who all the disciples the 12  disciples might have represented the twelve original tribes of israel  which would be restored once god s rule was the disciples were reportedly meant to be the rulers of the tribes in the coming kingdom  matthew 19:28,  luke according to bart ehrman  jesus  promise that the twelve would rule is historical  because the twelve included judas iscariot  in ehrman s view  no christians would have invented a line from jesus  promising rulership to the disciple who betrayed in mark  the disciples play hardly any role other than a negative one  while others sometimes respond to jesus with complete faith  his disciples are puzzled and they serve as a foil to jesus and to other the failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in mark  and the disciples make a better showing in matthew and says that jesus  mission was not about repentance  although he acknowledges that this opinion is unpopular  he argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in luke  that repentance was john the baptist s message  and that jesus  ministry would not have been scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been according to theissen and merz  jesus taught that god was generously giving people an opportunity to taught that an apocalyptic figure  the  son of man   would soon come on clouds of glory to gather the elect  or chosen ones  mark 13:24–27,  matthew 24:29–31,  luke 21:25–28).  he referred to himself as a  son of man  in the colloquial sense of  a person   but scholars do not know whether he also meant himself when he referred to the heavenly  son of man   paul the apostle and other early christians interpreted the  son of man  as the risen title christ  or messiah  indicates that jesus  followers believed him to be the anointed heir of king david  whom some jews expected to save israel  the gospels refer to him not only as a messiah but in the absolute form as  the messiah  or  equivalently   the christ   in early judaism  this absolute form of the title is not found  but only phrases such as  his messiah   the tradition is ambiguous enough to leave room for debate as to whether jesus defined his eschatological role as that of the the jewish messianic tradition included many different forms  some of them focused on a messiah figure and others based on the christian tradition  gerd theissen advances the hypothesis that jesus saw himself in messianic terms but did not claim the title bart ehrman argues that jesus did consider himself to be the messiah  albeit in the sense that he would be the king of the new political order that god would usher not in the sense that most people today think of the ad 30,  jesus and his followers traveled from galilee to jerusalem to observe jesus caused a disturbance in the second which was the center of jewish religious and civil authority  sanders associates it with jesus  prophecy that the temple would be totally jesus had a last meal with his disciples  which is the origin of the christian sacrament of bread and wine  jesus  words are recorded in the synoptics and in paul s first epistle to the corinthians  the differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled  and it is impossible to know what jesus intended  but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming kingdom  jesus probably expected to be killed  and he may have hoped that god would gospels say that jesus was betrayed to the authorities by a disciple  and many scholars consider this report to be highly he was executed on the orders of pontius pilate  the roman prefect of pilate most likely saw jesus  reference to the kingdom of god as a threat to roman authority and worked with the temple elites to have jesus the sadducean high-priestly  leaders of the temple more plausibly had jesus executed for political reasons than for his they may have regarded him as a threat to stability  especially after he caused a disturbance at the second other factors  such as jesus  triumphal entry into jerusalem  may have contributed to this most scholars consider jesus  crucifixion to be factual  because early christians would not have invented the painful death of their jesus  death  his followers said he rose from the dead  although exact details of their experiences are unclear  some of those who claimed to have witnessed jesus  resurrection later died for their belief  which indicates that their beliefs were likely according to sanders  the gospel reports contradict each other  which  according to him  suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate on the other hand  l  michael white suggests that inconsistencies in the gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown the followers of jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his research on the historical jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure  partly because of the variety of academic traditions represented by the given the scarcity of historical sources  it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the basic elements of his the portraits of jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other  and from the image portrayed in the is seen as the founder of  in the words of sanders  a   renewal movement within judaism   one of the criterion used to discern historical details in the  third quest  is the criterion of plausibility  relative to jesus  jewish context and to his influence on christianity  a disagreement in contemporary research is whether jesus was apocalyptic  most scholars conclude that he was an apocalyptic preacher  like john the baptist and paul the apostle  in contrast  certain prominent north american scholars  such as burton mack and john dominic crossan  advocate for a non-eschatological  jesus  one who is more of a cynic sage than an apocalyptic in addition to portraying jesus as an apocalyptic prophet  a charismatic healer or a cynic philosopher  some scholars portray him as the true messiah or an egalitarian prophet of social however  the attributes described in the portraits sometimes overlap  and scholars who differ on some attributes sometimes agree on the 18th  century  scholars have occasionally put forth that jesus was a political national messiah  but the evidence for this portrait is negligible  likewise  the proposal that jesus was a zealot does not fit with the earliest strata of the synoptic grew up in galilee and much of his ministry took place the languages spoken in galilee and judea during the 1st  century ad include jewish palestinian aramaic  hebrew  and greek  with aramaic being there is substantial consensus that jesus gave most of his teachings in scholars agree that jesus was a jew of 1st  century ioudaios in new testament is a term which in the contemporary context may refer to religion  second temple judaism   ethnicity  of judea   or in a review of the state of modern scholarship  amy-jill  levine writes that the entire question of ethnicity is  fraught with difficulty   and that  beyond recognizing that  jesus was jewish   rarely does the scholarship address what being  jewish  new testament gives no description of the physical appearance of jesus before his death—it is generally indifferent to racial appearances and does not refer to the features of the people it jesus probably looked like a typical jew of his time and according to some scholars was likely to have had a sinewy appearance due to his ascetic and itinerant christ myth theory is the hypothesis that jesus of nazareth never existed  or if he did  that he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of christianity and the accounts in the stories of jesus  birth  along with other key events  have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that jesus himself was a bruno bauer (1809–1882)  taught that the first gospel was a work of literature that produced history rather than described according to albert kalthoff (1850–1906)  a social movement produced jesus when it encountered jewish messianic arthur drews (1865–1935)  saw jesus as the concrete form of a myth that predated despite arguments put forward by authors who have questioned the existence of a historical jesus  there remains a strong consensus in historical-critical  biblical scholarship that a historical jesus did live in that area and in that time from his own disciples and followers  the jews of jesus  day generally rejected him as the messiah  as do the great majority of jews today  christian theologians  ecumenical councils  reformers and others have written extensively about jesus over the centuries  christian sects and schisms have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of jesus  meanwhile  manichaeans  gnostics  muslims  baha is  and others have found prominent places for jesus in their jesus has also had detractors  both past and present jesus is the central figure of although christian views of jesus vary  it is possible to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations  as stated in their catechetical or confessional christian views of jesus are derived from various sources  including the canonical gospels and new testament letters such as the pauline epistles and the johannine writings  these documents outline the key beliefs held by christians about jesus  including his divinity  humanity  and earthly life  and that he is the christ and the son of despite their many shared beliefs  not all christian denominations agree on all doctrines  and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout christianity for new testament states that the resurrection of jesus is the foundation of the christian faith (1  corinthians christians believe that through his sacrificial death and resurrection  humans can be reconciled with god and are thereby offered salvation and the promise of eternal recalling the words of john the baptist on the day after jesus  baptism  these doctrines sometimes refer to jesus as the lamb of god  who was crucified to fulfill his role as the servant of jesus is thus seen as the new and last adam  whose obedience contrasts with adam s christians view jesus as a role model  whose god-focused  life believers are encouraged to christians believe that jesus was both human and the son of while there has been theological debate over his some early christians viewed jesus as subordinate to the father  and others considered him an aspect of the father rather than a separate the church resolved the issues in ancient councils  which established the holy trinity  with jesus both fully human and fully trinitarian christians generally believe that jesus is the logos  god s incarnation and god the son  both fully divine and fully human  however  the doctrine of the trinity is not universally accepted among with the protestant reformation  christians such as michael servetus and the socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established jesus  two nontrinitarian christian groups include the church of jesus christ of latter-day  unitarians and jehovah s revere not only jesus himself  but also his name  devotions to the holy name of jesus go back to the earliest days of these devotions and feasts exist in both eastern and western rejects the idea of jesus being or a mediator to god  or part of a it holds that jesus is not the messiah  arguing that he neither fulfilled the messianic prophecies in the tanakh nor embodied the personal qualifications of the jews argue that jesus did not fulfill prophesies to build the third temple  ezekiel 37:26–28),  gather jews back to israel  isaiah 43:5–6),  bring world peace  isaiah 2:4),  and unite humanity under the god of israel  zechariah furthermore  according to jewish tradition  there were no prophets after who delivered his prophesies in the 5th  century criticism of jesus is long-standing.  the talmud  written and compiled from the 3rd  to the 5th  century includes stories that since medieval times have been considered to be defamatory accounts of in one such story  yeshu hanozri   jesus the christian    a lewd apostate  is executed by the jewish high court for spreading idolatry and practicing the majority of contemporary scholars consider that this material provides no information on the historical the mishneh torah  a late 12th  century work of jewish law written by moses maimonides  states that jesus is a  stumbling block  who makes  the majority of the world to err and serve a god other than the major figure in jesus  commonly transliterated as ʾīsā  is considered to be a messenger of god  allah  and the messiah (al-masih)  who was sent to guide the children of israel  bani isra il  with a new scripture  the gospel  referred to in islam as muslims regard the gospels of the new testament as inauthentic  and believe that jesus  original message was lost or altered and that muhammad came later to restore belief in jesus  and all other messengers of god  is a requirement for being a the quran mentions jesus by name 25  times—more often than emphasizes that jesus was a mortal human who  like all other prophets  had been divinely chosen to spread god s while the qur an acknowledges the virgin birth of jesus  he is considered to be neither the incarnation nor the son of god  islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism  tawhid  and forbid the association of partners with god  which would be like all prophets in islam  jesus is considered a quran describes the annunciation to mary  maryam  by an angel that she is to give birth to jesus while remaining a virgin  it calls the virgin birth a miracle that occurred by the will of the quran (21:91  and 66:12)  states that god breathed his spirit into mary while she was jesus is called the  spirit of god  because he was born through the action of the but that belief does not imply his aid in his ministry to the jewish people  jesus was given the ability to perform miracles  by permission of god rather than by his own through his ministry  jesus is seen as a precursor to according to the quran  jesus was not crucified but was merely made to appear that way to unbelievers by who physically raised jesus into the to muslims  it is the ascension rather than the crucifixion that constitutes a major event in the life of most muslims believe that jesus will return to earth at the end of time and defeat the antichrist (ad-dajjal)  by killing him in ahmadiyya muslim community has several distinct teachings about jesus  ahmadis believe that he was a mortal man who survived his crucifixion and died a natural death at the age of 120  in kashmir  india and is buried at roza teachings consider jesus to be a manifestation of god  a bahá í concept for between god and humanity  serving as messengers and reflecting god s qualities and the bahá í concept emphasizes the simultaneous qualities of humanity and thus  it is similar to the christian concept of bahá í thought accepts jesus as the son of in bahá í thought  jesus was a perfect incarnation of god s attributes  but bahá í teachings reject the idea that  ineffable essence  of the divinity was contained within a single human body because of their beliefs regarding  omnipresence and transcendence of the essence of the founder of the bahá í faith  wrote that since each manifestation of god has the same divine attributes  they can be seen as the spiritual  return  of all previous manifestations of god  and the appearance of each new manifestation of god inaugurates a religion that supersedes the former ones  a concept known as progressive bahá ís believe that god s plan unfolds gradually through this process as mankind matures  and that some of the manifestations arrive in specific fulfillment of the missions of previous ones  thus  bahá ís believe that bahá u lláh is the promised return of bahá í teachings confirm many  but not all  aspects of jesus as portrayed in the gospels  bahá ís believe in the virgin birth and in the but see the resurrection and the miracles of jesus as christian gnosticism  now a largely extinct religious jesus was sent from the divine realm and provided the secret knowledge  gnosis  necessary for salvation  most gnostics believed that jesus was a human who became possessed by the spirit of  the christ  at his baptism  this spirit left jesus  body during the crucifixion  but was rejoined to him when he was raised from the dead  some gnostics  however  were docetics  believed that jesus did not have a physical body  but only appeared to possess manichaeism  a gnostic sect  accepted jesus as a prophet  in addition to revering gautama buddha and hindus consider jesus to be an avatar or a paramahansa yogananda  an indian guru  taught that jesus was the reincarnation

depictions of jesus at the dura-europos  church are firmly dated to before thereafter  despite the lack of biblical references or historical records  a wide range of depictions of jesus appeared during the last two millennia  often influenced by cultural settings  political circumstances and theological as in other early christian art  the earliest depictions date to the late 2nd  or early 3rd  century  and surviving images are found especially in the catacombs of depiction of christ in pictorial form was highly controversial in the early from the 5th  century onward  flat painted icons became popular in the eastern the byzantine iconoclasm acted as a barrier to developments in the east  but by the ninth century  art was permitted the protestant reformation brought renewed resistance to imagery  but total prohibition was atypical  and protestant objections to images have tended to reduce since the 16th  century  although large images are generally avoided  few protestants now object to book illustrations depicting the use of depictions of jesus is advocated by the leaders of denominations such as anglicans and and is a key element of the eastern orthodox transfiguration

veneration  such as kisses and prostration  and they are thought to be powerful channels of divine the renaissance brought forth a number of artists who focused on depictions of jesus  fra angelico
