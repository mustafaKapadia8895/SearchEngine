 1954  atlantic hurricane season -  wikipediathe 1954  atlantic hurricane season resulted in over $750  million in 1]  the most of any season at the time  the season officially began on june 15,  and nine days later the first named storm developed  hurricane alice developed in the gulf of mexico and moved inland along the rio grande  producing significant precipitation and record flooding that killed 55  people  activity was slow until late august  only barbara  a minimal tropical storm  developed in july  in the span of two weeks  hurricanes carol and edna followed similar paths before both striking new england as major 2]  the latter became the costliest hurricane in maine s history in late september  tropical storm gilda killed 29  people after drenching northern honduras  a tropical depression in early october was captured by a high-altitude  photograph on a rocket  thus producing the first large-scale  image of a tropical cyclone  the strongest and deadliest hurricane of the season was hurricane hazel  which killed thousands in haiti before striking near the north carolina south carolina border in october  it caused heavy damage in the united states before becoming extratropical and affecting ontario  intense rainfall affected toronto with severe flooding  leaving significant damage  the season officially ended on november 15,  although another hurricane named alice developed on december 30  to the northeast of the lesser antilles  it lasted until january 6  of the following year  in total  there were 16  tropical storms  7  hurricanes  and 3  major hurricanes the hurricane season officially began on june 15,  when the united states weather bureau in miami  florida began 24‑hour  operations  the agency  under the direction of grady norton had access to 43  other weather stations across the atlantic norton died during the season from a stroke while tracking hurricane additionally  a group of hurricane hunters planes were put on standby for the season  able to be flown out into storms and collect during the season  there were eight named as well as an unnamed hurricane and a tropical the season officially ended on november although an unnamed tropical storm formed a day in addition  tropical storm alice developed on december 31,  the latest a tropical cyclone has developed in the calendar tropical cyclones left 193  deaths and $756  million in becoming the costliest hurricane season at the the season was one of six to have three major hurricanes strike the country  along with 2005   which had four   1893,  1909,  1933,  and two of the major hurricanes – carol and edna – struck new england  this occurred despite an average of only 5–10  new england hurricanes per century  carol struck connecticut as a hurricane and left widespread heavy only ten days later  edna became the costliest hurricane in maine s the third major hurricane  hazel  was the strongest hurricane of the season  attaining winds of 150  mph (240  unusually  no tropical cyclones affected season s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy  ace  rating of which is categorized as being  above ace is  broadly speaking  a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed  so storms that last a long time  as well as particularly strong hurricanes  have high aces  ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34  knots (39  mph  63  km h  or tropical storm broad trough developed over the eastern gulf of mexico on may 26.  a frontal disturbance formed over florida along the trough  spawning an area of broad cyclonic turning  after emerging into the western atlantic ocean  a closed circulation developed within the system  and it is estimated that a tropical depression formed on may 28  about 100  mi (160  km  east of jacksonville  florida  ship observations in the region suggested that the depression intensified into a tropical storm by late on may 28.  the system was small  and was not discovered to have been a tropical cyclone until a reanalysis of data in 2015.  the storm moved to the northeast ahead of an approaching trough  bypassing the carolinas to the east  rainfall brushed the coast of north carolina  on may 29,  ship observations suggested peak winds of 50  mph (85  km h   on the next day  the storm became associated with a warm front  indicating that it became extratropical to the southeast of new england  continuing to the northeast  the former storm crossed over the southeastern coast of newfoundland before being absorbed by another nontropical low to the northwest on may trough formed over southern florida on june 17.  early the next day  a circulation formed  signaling that a tropical depression also developed over the everglades  the system moved slowly north-northeastward,  emerging into the western atlantic ocean at 06:00  utc on june 20.  shortly thereafter  the depression intensified into a tropical storm  although the structure was broad and asymmetric due to association with a nearby upper-level  low  signaling that the system was possibly a subtropical cyclone  ship reports in the region indicate that the storm continued to intensify  on june 22,  the structure became much more symmetrical while passing just off the outer banks  bringing winds of 33  mph (54  km h  to wilmington  north carolina  that day  the hurricane hunters estimated winds of 80  mph (130  km h   and is possible that the storm briefly attained hurricane status  the peak winds were estimated at 70  mph (110  km h   due to a pressure reading of 994  mbar (29.4  inhg   the storm accelerated northeastward due to an approaching cold front  on june 24,  the storm became extratropical  and shortly thereafter made landfall along southwestern nova scotia  the system dissipated the next day over the northern gulf of saint june 24,  a tropical storm and later hurricane rapidly developed in the western gulf of giving the citizens of southern texas and northeastern mexico little time to hurricane alice rapidly intensified to at least a strong category 2  storm  similar to 2010's  hurricane alex  moved ashore in northeastern mexico and quickly producing minor damage and killing one person due to a fallen power june 26,  alice dissipated  although the system dropped torrential rainfall across southern texas and northeastern the maximum rainfall officially peaked at 24.07  in (611  mm  near pandale  concentrated in an area around the pecos river  high precipitation accumulations occurred in areas that had seen little rains in three years  this led to significant flooding along the pecos river that produced  probably the greatest rate of runoff for a watershed of size in the united states   as reported by the international boundary and water ozona  texas sustained the most impact  estimated at $2  million in damage  downstream  the rio grande rose to the highest level since which flooded seven towns on either side of the eagle pass  texas was flooded with 8  ft (2.4  m  of overall there were at least 55  dissipating cold front stalled over the southeastern united states from arkansas to north carolina on july 9.  on the next day  a low pressure area developed along the coast of georgia  soon after  the front dissipated  and by 12:00  utc on july 10,  the system developed into a tropical storm  observations from a coastal lighthouse and a nearby ship indicated that the storm attained peak winds of 50  mph (85  km h  while moving slowly east-northeastward,  just offshore the carolinas  the storm began weakening on july 13,  and dissipated the next day when it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm that was developing to the july 27,  a tropical depression developed in the northern gulf of mexico  about 100  mi (160  km  south of grand isle  a map of the low pressure areas forming in july 1954  indicated that the system originated near the mississippi delta and tracked after forming  the depression tracked northwestward  intensifying into tropical storm barbara early on july 28.  maximum sustained winds reached 45  mph (75  although a tanker offshore named the henry m  dawes reported wind gusts of 60  mph (97  officials at the united states weather bureau posted a storm warning from cameron to burrwood  louisiana  and also advised small craft to remain at port along the entire northern gulf without intensifying further  barbara made landfall near vermilion bay  louisiana on july dissipating the next day over the storm dropped heavy rainfall along its including over 2  in (51  mm  in new the rains caused flooding as well as some damage to the rice however  the monthly weather review yearly summary described the precipitation as  far more beneficial than damaging   there was no wind developed from a tropical wave near the bahamas on august 25.  it quickly intensified as it tracked generally to the north  becoming a hurricane on august 27.  moving parallel to the coastline of the southeastern united states  carol passed just east of cape hatteras with winds estimated at 110  mph (175  it intensified further as it accelerated  striking eastern long island as category 3  carol made its final landfall on old saybrook  connecticut late on august 31.  within a few hours  the hurricane became extratropical over new hampshire  which later dissipated over north carolina  hurricane-force  winds left minor damage to estimated around rains from carol alleviated drought conditions in the washington  d c  on long island  the storm surge flooded the montauk highway with 4  ft (1.2  m  of water about a mile across  high winds left 275,000  homes without power  and damage totaled $3  million on the hurricane moved ashore in connecticut shortly after high tide  producing a storm surge of 10–15  ft (3–4.5  m  from new london eastward  the surge in narragansett bay reached 14.4  ft (4.4  m   which surpassed that of the 1938  new england hurricane  which flooded downtown providence with 12  feet (3.7  m  of water  in new london  rainfall peaked around 6  in (150  the hurricane produced winds of over 115  mph (185  km h  in connecticut and rhode including a record-high  gust of 135  mph (215  km h  at block widespread areas were left without power from eastern connecticut to southern further north in maine  hurricane carol downed hundreds of trees  as well as destroying widespread apple groves and corn fields  it became the costliest natural disaster in the state s only to be surpassed by hurricane edna ten days across new england  the hurricane destroyed about 4,000  homes  3,500  cars  and 3,000  damage totaled $460  and there were 60  in neighboring canada  high rains caused flooding while strong winds downed trees and power tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on august 31  to the northwest of puerto rico  it moved rapidly north-northwestward,  intensifying into tropical storm dolly later that day and into a hurricane early on september early in the storm s duration  the u s  weather bureau noted the potential for dolly to affect the same areas of new england that hurricane carol struck just days however  the hurricane turned to the north away from land  the hurricane hunters estimated maximum sustained winds of 85  mph (140  km h  on september 2  after the storm passed about halfway between the outer banks and bermuda  dolly turned to the northeast on september 2  and became extratropical later that day to the south of nova scotia  it was tracked until september 4,  until it was last located to the north of the azores  there was no reported dolly became extratropical  the tropical depression that later became hurricane edna developed east of the lesser antilles on september it moved northwestward  dropping heavy rainfall on puerto rico as it passed north of the on september 7  edna became a hurricane  and the next day reached peak winds of 120  mph (195  km h   it turned to the north and northeast  bypassing the outer banks and skirting cape on september 11,  edna struck massachusetts as a strong category 2  the hurricane later moved ashore near the border between maine and new brunswick around the time it became extratropical  the remnants persisted a few more days before dissipating south of in its duration  edna produced high seas and gale-force  winds in the bahamas  but there was no damage there  hurricane-force  winds occurred in the outer banks  although damage was as it passed new england  edna produced a 6  ft (1.8  m  storm surge during a high tide  which caused severe flooding in martha s vineyard  nantucket  and cape cod  wind gusts peaked at 120  mph (190  km h  on martha s vineyard  and the strong winds across the region left widespread power outages  the hurricane dropped additional heavy rainfall to areas affected by carol  resulting in flooding in massachusetts and rhode in long island and new england  the hurricane left over $42  million in damage and 20  deaths  only 11  days after carol affected the same about a third of the damage occurred in becoming the costliest hurricane on record in the hurricane-force  winds extended into canada  causing $6  million in damage (1954  cad   mostly from crop damage  there was one death in nova surface trough persisted across the central atlantic ocean on september 2.  over the next few days  the system moved slowly northeastward  independent of any frontal systems  on september 6,  nearby ships indicated that the a closed circulation had developed  marking the genesis of the system as a tropical depression  accelerating to the northeast  the storm reached peak winds of 45  mph (75  km h  on september 7.  by the next day  the system became extratropical  and soon after was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm to the tropical storm formed in the bay of campeche on september 11.  given the name florence  the storm moved generally west-southwestward  with a small radius of maximum winds  hurricane hunters reported winds of 65  mph (105  km h   although winds were initially  before reanalysis confirmed it was a tropical storm  estimated to have reached minimal hurricane force  or 75  mph (120  before the storm moved ashore  officials in veracruz evacuated residents from low-lying  areas  and overall about 90,000  people left their on september 12,  florence moved ashore between tuxpan  and nautla  veracruz and quickly the hurricane flooded coastal cities with up to 3  ft (0.91  m  of water  cutting off communications throughout the damage was heaviest around poza rica  primarily from the destruction of banana plantations  monetary damage was estimated around $1.5  million  and there were five reported low pressure area was present north of the yucatán peninsula on september 14.  nearby ship observations indicated that a tropical depression developed the next day in the central gulf of mexico  although the system s large structure meant it could have been a subtropical cyclone  the system moved slowly westward  bringing winds of 30  mph (45  km h  to the coast of louisiana  it is estimated that the storm reached peak winds of 45  mph (75  km h  on september 16,  based on reports from ships and the hurricane hunters  on the next day  the system began weakening over water  dissipating on september 18  without moving september 24,  tropical storm gilda developed in the central caribbean sea about halfway between jamaica and colombia  a small storm  it moved westward throughout its duration  on september 26,  gilda attained peak winds of 70  mph (110  km h  while nearing northeastern honduras  the storm paralleled the coastline a short distance offshore  maintaining its intensity before hitting and later weakening over belize on september 27.  it re-emerged  in the gulf of mexico before making another landfall near tampico as a tropical depression on september while moving just offshore the coast of honduras  gilda dropped intense which flooding about 680  mi2  (1760  km2)  of land along the chamelecón and ulúa rivers  the waters caused the widespread destruction of banana plantations and houses  leaving about 3,000  people homeless  the united fruit company reacted to this destruction by firing 10,000  of its about 100,000  workers within the honduras 39th  president juan manuel gálvez appealed for aid from the united states  in response  u s  air force planes flew food  medicine  rafts  and water purification tablets to the most affected a total of 29  people were killed in honduras  when gilda made its landfall in belize  it left little property damage and no tropical depression formed in the central atlantic on september 25.  it drifted east-northeastward,  eventually becoming a tropical storm on september 29.  the storm curved to the west and west-southwest,  becoming a hurricane on october 2.  it turned to the northeast on october 3,  and reached a peak of 100  mph (155  km h  winds about halfway between bermuda and the azores  by that point it began accelerating  and late on october 6  the hurricane became extratropical over the northeastern atlantic  early the next day it was last observed to the south of the hurricane was not named due to its presence in the eastern atlantic and not being a threat to october 2,  a tropical depression moved westward from the coast of cuba into the gulf of mexico  it moved westward without intensifying beyond winds of 35  mph (55  km h   moving ashore about 40  mi (65  km  north of brownsville  texas  the depression weakened as it moved across southern texas and dropped heavy rainfall  brownsville recorded over 3  in (75  mm  in a 45-minute  period  as well as about 6  in (150  mm  in six the rainfall rates of about an inch per hour was the heaviest since june 1950.  the depression also moved ashore with high waves and the system reached the big bend region on october 5  it reintensified slightly  around that time  the united states navy conducted a rocket test from white sands  new mexico  this was despite that such tests were rarely performed when the skies were cloudy  the rocket took an unintended photograph of the depression from an altitude of about 100  miles (160  km   which became the first such large-scale  image of a tropical the depression later moved into new mexico and dropped additional interacting with an approaching cold flooding was reported around as well as along the pecos river system  rainfall in the state peaked at 9.8  in (250  mm  in canton  new mexico  the system dissipated on october hazel was the deadliest and costliest hurricane of the the storm killed as many as 1,000  people in haiti before striking the united states near the border between north and south carolina  as a category 4  after causing 95  fatalities in the hazel struck canada as an extratropical storm  raising the death toll by 81  people  mostly in formed on october 5  just east of the windward islands and intensified into a category 1  hurricane while crossing the southeastern caribbean sea  after making a hard turn northward  similar to 2012's  hurricane sandy   it rapidly intensified as it approached haiti  reaching category 3  intensity before in haiti  hazel destroyed 40%  of the coffee trees and 50%  of the cacao crop  affecting the economy for several years to it fluctuated in intensity before making landfall as a category 4  hurricane in the carolinas  which destroyed most waterfront dwellings near its point of it affected several more states  including delaware  maryland  new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  virginia  and west virginia  bringing gusts near 100  mph (160  km h  and causing $308  million in hazel arrived in ontario  rivers and streams passing through the greater toronto area overflowed their banks  causing severe as a result  many residential areas located in floodplains  such as the raymore drive area  were subsequently converted to in canada alone  over c$135  million (2009:  $1.1  billion  of damage was hazel was particularly destructive in toronto  as a result of a combination of a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms and the storm s unexpected retention of power  hazel had traveled 680  mi (1,090  km  over land  but while approaching canada  it had merged with an existing powerful cold front  the storm stalled over the greater toronto area  and although it was now extratropical  it remained as powerful as a category 1  to help with the cleanup  800  members of the military were summoned  and a hurricane relief fund was established that distributed $5.1  million (2009:  $41.7  million  in november 16,  a tropical depression developed about halfway between the lesser antilles and the azores  it moved to the west  intensifying into a tropical storm and reaching peak winds of 40  mph (65  km h   however  due to limited data  it is possible that the storm remained a tropical depression   the storm maintained that intensity on november 21  when it began weakening  dissipating later that final storm of the season  alice  developed on december 30  from a trough of low pressure in the central atlantic ocean in an area of unusually favorable conditions  the storm moved southwestward and gradually strengthened to reach hurricane status  it persisted into the following calendar year  passing through the leeward islands on january 2.  alice reached peak winds of 90  mph (150  km h  before encountering cold air and turning to the southeast  it dissipated on january 6  over the southeastern caribbean produced heavy rainfall and moderately strong winds across several islands along its path  saba and anguilla were affected the most  with total damage amounting to $623,500  (1955  operationally  lack of definitive data prevented the u s  weather bureau from declaring the system a hurricane until january 2.  it received the name alice in early 1955,  though re-analysis  of the data supported extending its track to the previous year  resulting in two tropical cyclones of the same name in one season  it was one of only two storms to span two calendar years  along with tropical storm zeta in following names were used for named storms  tropical storms and hurricanes  that formed in the north atlantic in 1954.  the list was the same as 1953  with the exception of gilda  which replaced gail due to the name s confusion with the term names that were not assigned are marked in gray the name carol was re-used  in the 1965  season  but was retroactively retired when the modern naming system was introduced  edna was reused in 1968  and retired  hazel was not re-used  and was
