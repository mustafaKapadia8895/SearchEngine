 plate tectonics -  wikipediaplate tectonics  from the late latin tectonicus  from the greek  τεκτονικός  pertaining to is a scientific theory describing the large-scale  motion of seven large plates and the movements of a larger number of smaller plates of the earth s lithosphere  since tectonic processes began on earth between 3  and 3.5  billion years ago  the model builds on the concept of continental drift  an idea developed during the first decades of the 20th  century  the geoscientific community accepted plate-tectonic  theory after seafloor spreading was validated in the late 1950s  and early 1960s.the  lithosphere  which is the rigid outermost shell of a planet  the crust and upper mantle   is broken into tectonic plates  the earth s lithosphere is composed of seven or eight major plates  depending on how they are defined  and many minor plates  where the plates meet  their relative motion determines the type of boundary  convergent  divergent  or transform  earthquakes  volcanic activity  mountain-building,  and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries  or faults   the relative movement of the plates typically ranges from zero to 100  mm plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere  each topped by its own kind of crust  along convergent boundaries  subduction  or one plate moving under another  carries the lower one down into the mantle  the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new  oceanic  crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading  in this way  the total surface of the lithosphere remains the same  this prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt principle  earlier theories  since disproven  proposed gradual shrinking  contraction  or gradual expansion of the plates are able to move because the earth s lithosphere has greater mechanical strength than the underlying asthenosphere  lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection  that is  the slow creeping motion of earth s solid mantle  plate movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from spreading ridges due to variations in topography  the ridge is a topographic high  and density changes in the crust  density increases as newly formed crust cools and moves away from the ridge   at subduction zones the relatively cold  dense crust is  pulled  or sinks down into the mantle over the downward convecting limb of a mantle cell  another explanation lies in the different forces generated by tidal forces of the sun and moon  the relative importance of each of these factors and their relationship to each other is unclear  and still the subject of much debate the outer layers of the earth are divided into the lithosphere and asthenosphere  the division is based on differences in mechanical properties and in the method for the transfer of heat  the lithosphere is cooler and more rigid  while the asthenosphere is hotter and flows more easily  in terms of heat transfer  the lithosphere loses heat by conduction  whereas the asthenosphere also transfers heat by convection and has a nearly adiabatic temperature gradient  this division should not be confused with the chemical subdivision of these same layers into the mantle  comprising both the asthenosphere and the mantle portion of the lithosphere  and the crust  a given piece of mantle may be part of the lithosphere or the asthenosphere at different times depending on its temperature and pressure the key principle of plate tectonics is that the lithosphere exists as separate and distinct tectonic plates  which ride on the fluid-like  (visco-elastic  solid  asthenosphere  plate motions range up to a typical 10–40  mm year (mid-atlantic  ridge  about as fast as fingernails grow   to about 160  mm year  nazca plate  about as fast as hair the driving mechanism behind this movement is described below tectonic lithosphere plates consist of lithospheric mantle overlain by one or two types of crustal material  oceanic crust  in older texts called sima from silicon and magnesium  and continental crust  sial from silicon and aluminium   average oceanic lithosphere is typically 100  km (62  mi  its thickness is a function of its age  as time passes  it conductively cools and subjacent cooling mantle is added to its base  because it is formed at mid-ocean  ridges and spreads outwards  its thickness is therefore a function of its distance from the mid-ocean  ridge where it was formed  for a typical distance that oceanic lithosphere must travel before being subducted  the thickness varies from about 6  km (4  mi  thick at mid-ocean  ridges to greater than 100  km (62  mi  at subduction zones  for shorter or longer distances  the subduction zone  and therefore also the mean  thickness becomes smaller or larger  continental lithosphere is typically about 200  km thick  though this varies considerably between basins  mountain ranges  and stable cratonic interiors of continents the location where two plates meet is called a plate boundary  plate boundaries are commonly associated with geological events such as earthquakes and the creation of topographic features such as mountains  volcanoes  mid-ocean  ridges  and oceanic trenches  the majority of the world s active volcanoes occur along plate boundaries  with the pacific plate s ring of fire being the most active and widely known today  these boundaries are discussed in further detail below  some volcanoes occur in the interiors of plates  and these have been variously attributed to internal plate and to mantle plumes as explained above  tectonic plates may include continental crust or oceanic crust  and most plates contain both  for example  the african plate includes the continent and parts of the floor of the atlantic and indian oceans  the distinction between oceanic crust and continental crust is based on their modes of formation  oceanic crust is formed at sea-floor  spreading centers  and continental crust is formed through arc volcanism and accretion of terranes through tectonic processes  though some of these terranes may contain ophiolite sequences  which are pieces of oceanic crust considered to be part of the continent when they exit the standard cycle of formation and spreading centers and subduction beneath continents  oceanic crust is also denser than continental crust owing to their different compositions  oceanic crust is denser because it has less silicon and more heavier elements   mafic   than continental crust as a result of this density stratification  oceanic crust generally lies below sea level  for example most of the pacific plate   while continental crust buoyantly projects above sea level  see the page isostasy for explanation of this principle  three types of plate boundaries with a fourth  mixed type  characterized by the way the plates move relative to each other  they are associated with different types of surface phenomena  the different types of plate boundaries has generally been accepted that tectonic plates are able to move because of the relative density of oceanic lithosphere and the relative weakness of the asthenosphere  dissipation of heat from the mantle is acknowledged to be the original source of the energy required to drive plate tectonics through convection or large scale upwelling and doming  the current view  though still a matter of some debate  asserts that as a consequence  a powerful source of plate motion is generated due to the excess density of the oceanic lithosphere sinking in subduction zones  when the new crust forms at mid-ocean  ridges  this oceanic lithosphere is initially less dense than the underlying asthenosphere  but it becomes denser with age as it conductively cools and thickens  the greater density of old lithosphere relative to the underlying asthenosphere allows it to sink into the deep mantle at subduction zones  providing most of the driving force for plate movement  the weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction although subduction is thought to be the strongest force driving plate motions  it cannot be the only force since there are plates such as the north american plate which are moving  yet are nowhere being subducted  the same is true for the enormous eurasian plate  the sources of plate motion are a matter of intensive research and discussion among scientists  one of the main points is that the kinematic pattern of the movement itself should be separated clearly from the possible geodynamic mechanism that is invoked as the driving force of the observed movement  as some patterns may be explained by more than one in short  the driving forces advocated at the moment can be divided into three categories based on the relationship to the movement  mantle dynamics related  gravity related  mostly secondary forces   and earth rotation related for much of the last quarter century  the leading theory of the driving force behind tectonic plate motions envisaged large scale convection currents in the upper mantle  which can be transmitted through the asthenosphere  this theory was launched by arthur holmes and some forerunners in the and was immediately recognized as the solution for the acceptance of the theory as originally discussed in the papers of alfred wegener in the early years of the century  however  despite its acceptance  it was long debated in the scientific community because the leading theory still envisaged a static earth without moving continents up until the major breakthroughs of the early sixties.two-  and three-dimensional  imaging of earth s interior  seismic tomography  shows a varying lateral density distribution throughout the mantle  such density variations can be material  from rock chemistry   mineral  from variations in mineral structures   or thermal  through thermal expansion and contraction from heat energy   the manifestation of this varying lateral density is mantle convection from buoyancy mantle convection directly and indirectly relates to plate motion is a matter of ongoing study and discussion in geodynamics  somehow  this energy must be transferred to the lithosphere for tectonic plates to move  there are essentially two main types of forces that are thought to influence plate motion  friction and gravity lately  the convection theory has been much debated  as modern techniques based on 3d  seismic tomography still fail to recognize these predicted large scale convection cells  therefore  alternative views have been proposed in the theory of plume tectonics developed during the 1990s,  a modified concept of mantle convection currents is used  it asserts that super plumes rise from the deeper mantle and are the drivers or substitutes of the major convection cells  these ideas  which find their roots in the early 1930s  with the so-called   fixistic  ideas of the european and russian earth science schools  find resonance in the modern theories which envisage hot spots or mantle plumes which remain fixed and are overridden by oceanic and continental lithosphere plates over time and leave their traces in the geological record  though these phenomena are not invoked as real driving mechanisms  but rather as modulators   modern theories that continue building on the older mantle doming concepts and see plate movements as a secondary phenomena are beyond the scope of this page and are discussed elsewhere  for example on the plume tectonics page  another theory is that the mantle flows neither in cells nor large plumes but rather as a series of channels just below the earth s crust  which then provide basal friction to the lithosphere  this theory  called  surge tectonics   became quite popular in geophysics and geodynamics during the 1980s  and recent research  based on three-dimensional  computer modeling  suggests that plate geometry is governed by a feedback between mantle convection patterns and the strength of the related to gravity are usually invoked as secondary phenomena within the framework of a more general driving mechanism such as the various forms of mantle dynamics described above gravitational sliding away from a spreading ridge  according to many authors  plate motion is driven by the higher elevation of plates at ocean as oceanic lithosphere is formed at spreading ridges from hot mantle material  it gradually cools and thickens with age  and thus adds distance from the ridge   cool oceanic lithosphere is significantly denser than the hot mantle material from which it is derived and so with increasing thickness it gradually subsides into the mantle to compensate the greater load  the result is a slight lateral incline with increased distance from the ridge axis this force is regarded as a secondary force and is often referred to as  ridge push   this is a misnomer as nothing is  pushing  horizontally and tensional features are dominant along ridges  it is more accurate to refer to this mechanism as gravitational sliding as variable topography across the totality of the plate can vary considerably and the topography of spreading ridges is only the most prominent feature  other mechanisms generating this gravitational secondary force include flexural bulging of the lithosphere before it dives underneath an adjacent plate which produces a clear topographical feature that can offset  or at least affect  the influence of topographical ocean ridges  and mantle plumes and hot spots  which are postulated to impinge on the underside of tectonic plates.slab-pull:  current scientific opinion is that the asthenosphere is insufficiently competent or rigid to directly cause motion by friction along the base of the lithosphere  slab pull is therefore most widely thought to be the greatest force acting on the plates  in this current understanding  plate motion is mostly driven by the weight of cold  dense plates sinking into the mantle at recent models indicate that trench suction plays an important role as well  however  the fact that the north american plate is nowhere being subducted  although it is in motion  presents a problem  the same holds for the african  eurasian  and antarctic plates gravitational sliding away from mantle doming  according to older theories  one of the driving mechanisms of the plates is the existence of large scale asthenosphere mantle domes which cause the gravitational sliding of lithosphere plates away from them  this gravitational sliding represents a secondary phenomenon of this basically vertically oriented mechanism  this can act on various scales  from the small scale of one island arc up to the larger scale of an entire ocean wegener  being a meteorologist  had proposed tidal forces and pole flight needed  as the main driving mechanisms behind continental drift  however  these forces were considered far too small to cause continental motion as the concept was of continents plowing through oceanic therefore  wegener later changed his position and asserted that convection currents are the main driving force of plate tectonics in the last edition of his book in 1929.however,  in the plate tectonics context  accepted since the seafloor spreading proposals of heezen  hess  dietz  morley  vine  and matthews  see below  during the early 1960s),  the oceanic crust is suggested to be in motion with the continents which caused the proposals related to earth rotation to be reconsidered  in more recent literature  these driving forces are forces that are small and generally negligible are for these mechanisms to be overall valid  systematic relationships should exist all over the globe between the orientation and kinematics of deformation and the geographical latitudinal and longitudinal grid of the earth itself  ironically  these systematic relations studies in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century underline exactly the opposite  that the plates had not moved in time  that the deformation grid was fixed with respect to the earth equator and axis  and that gravitational driving forces were generally acting vertically and caused only local horizontal movements  the so-called  pre-plate  tectonic   fixist theories    later studies  discussed below on this page   therefore  invoked many of the relationships recognized during this pre-plate  tectonics period to support their theories  see the anticipations and reviews in the work of van dijk and the many forces discussed in this paragraph  tidal force is still highly debated and defended as a possible principle driving force of plate tectonics  the other forces are only used in global geodynamic models not using plate tectonics concepts  therefore beyond the discussions treated in this section  or proposed as minor modulations within the overall plate tectonics model in 1973,  george w  of the usgs and r  c  presented evidence for a general westward drift of the earth s lithosphere with respect to the mantle  he concluded that tidal forces  the tidal lag or  friction   caused by the earth s rotation and the forces acting upon it by the moon are a driving force for plate tectonics  as the earth spins eastward beneath the moon  the moon s gravity ever so slightly pulls the earth s surface layer back westward  just as proposed by alfred wegener  see above   in a more recent 2006  scientists reviewed and advocated these earlier proposed ideas  it has also been suggested recently in lovett (2006)  that this observation may also explain why venus and mars have no plate tectonics  as venus has no moon and mars  moons are too small to have significant tidal effects on the planet  in a recent it was suggested that  on the other hand  it can easily be observed that many plates are moving north and eastward  and that the dominantly westward motion of the pacific ocean basins derives simply from the eastward bias of the pacific spreading center  which is not a predicted manifestation of such lunar forces   in the same paper the authors admit  however  that relative to the lower mantle  there is a slight westward component in the motions of all the plates  they demonstrated though that the westward drift  seen only for the past 30  ma  is attributed to the increased dominance of the steadily growing and accelerating pacific plate  the debate is still open the vector of a plate s motion is a function of all the forces acting on the plate  however  therein lies the problem regarding the degree to which each process contributes to the overall motion of each tectonic plate the diversity of geodynamic settings and the properties of each plate result from the impact of the various processes actively driving each individual plate  one method of dealing with this problem is to consider the relative rate at which each plate is moving as well as the evidence related to the significance of each process to the overall driving force on the plate one of the most significant correlations discovered to date is that lithospheric plates attached to downgoing  subducting  plates move much faster than plates not attached to subducting plates  the pacific plate  for instance  is essentially surrounded by zones of subduction  the so-called  ring of fire  and moves much faster than the plates of the atlantic basin  which are attached  perhaps one could say  welded   to adjacent continents instead of subducting plates  it is thus thought that forces associated with the downgoing plate  slab pull and slab suction  are the driving forces which determine the motion of plates  except for those plates which are not being this view however has been contradicted by a recent study which found that the actual motions of the pacific plate and other plates associated with the east pacific rise do not correlate mainly with either slab pull or slab push  but rather with a mantle convection upwelling whose horizontal spreading along the bases of the various plates drives them along via viscosity-related  traction the driving forces of plate motion continue to be active subjects of on-going  research within geophysics and tectonophysics in line with other previous and contemporaneous proposals  in 1912  the meteorologist alfred wegener amply described what he called continental drift  expanded in his 1915  book the origin of continents and and the scientific debate started that would end up fifty years later in the theory of plate starting from the idea  also expressed by his forerunners  that the present continents once formed a single land mass  which was called pangea later on  that drifted apart  thus releasing the continents from the earth s mantle and likening them to  icebergs  of low density granite floating on a sea of denser supporting evidence for the idea came from the dove-tailing  outlines of south america s east coast and africa s west coast  and from the matching of the rock formations along these edges  confirmation of their previous contiguous nature also came from the fossil plants glossopteris and gangamopteris  and the therapsid or mammal-like  reptile lystrosaurus  all widely distributed over south america  africa  antarctica  india  and australia  the evidence for such an erstwhile joining of these continents was patent to field geologists working in the southern hemisphere  the south african alex du toit put together a mass of such information in his 1937  publication our wandering continents  and went further than wegener in recognising the strong links between the gondwana fragments but without detailed evidence and a force sufficient to drive the movement  the theory was not generally accepted  the earth might have a solid crust and mantle and a liquid core  but there seemed to be no way that portions of the crust could move around  distinguished scientists  such as harold jeffreys and charles schuchert  were outspoken critics of continental drift despite much opposition  the view of continental drift gained support and a lively debate started between  drifters  or  mobilists   proponents of the theory  and  fixists   opponents   during the 1920s,  1930s  and 1940s,  the former reached important milestones proposing that convection currents might have driven the plate movements  and that spreading may have occurred below the sea within the oceanic crust  concepts close to the elements now incorporated in plate tectonics were proposed by geophysicists and geologists  both fixists and mobilists  like vening-meinesz,  holmes  and umbgrove one of the first pieces of geophysical evidence that was used to support the movement of lithospheric plates came from paleomagnetism  this is based on the fact that rocks of different ages show a variable magnetic field direction  evidenced by studies since the mid–nineteenth century  the magnetic north and south poles reverse through time  and  especially important in paleotectonic studies  the relative position of the magnetic north pole varies through time  initially  during the first half of the twentieth century  the latter phenomenon was explained by introducing what was called  polar wander   see apparent polar wander   i e   it was assumed that the north pole location had been shifting through time  an alternative explanation  though  was that the continents had moved  shifted and rotated  relative to the north pole  and each continent  in fact  shows its own  polar wander path   during the late 1950s  it was successfully shown on two occasions that these data could show the validity of continental drift  by keith runcorn in a paper in and by warren carey in a symposium held in march second piece of evidence in support of continental drift came during the late 1950s  and early 60s  from data on the bathymetry of the deep ocean floors and the nature of the oceanic crust such as magnetic properties and  more generally  with the development of marine which gave evidence for the association of seafloor spreading along the mid-oceanic  ridges and magnetic field reversals  published between 1959  and 1963  by heezen  dietz  hess  mason  vine   matthews  and advances in early seismic imaging techniques in and around wadati–benioff zones along the trenches bounding many continental margins  together with many other geophysical  e g  gravimetric  and geological observations  showed how the oceanic crust could disappear into the mantle  providing the mechanism to balance the extension of the ocean basins with shortening along its margins all this evidence  both from the ocean floor and from the continental margins  made it clear around 1965  that continental drift was feasible and the theory of plate tectonics  which was defined in a series of papers between 1965  and 1967,  was born  with all its extraordinary explanatory and predictive power  the theory revolutionized the earth sciences  explaining a diverse range of geological phenomena and their implications in other studies such as paleogeography and paleobiology in the late 19th  and early 20th  centuries  geologists assumed that the earth s major features were fixed  and that most geologic features such as basin development and mountain ranges could be explained by vertical crustal movement  described in what is called the geosynclinal theory  generally  this was placed in the context of a contracting planet earth due to heat loss in the course of a relatively short geological time it was observed as early as 1596  that the opposite coasts of the atlantic ocean—or  more precisely  the edges of the continental shelves—have similar shapes and seem to have once fitted that time many theories were proposed to explain this apparent complementarity  but the assumption of a solid earth made these various proposals difficult to discovery of radioactivity and its associated heating properties in 1895  prompted a re-examination  of the apparent age of the this had previously been estimated by its cooling rate under the assumption that the earth s surface radiated like a black those calculations had implied that  even if it started at red heat  the earth would have dropped to its present temperature in a few tens of millions of years  armed with the knowledge of a new heat source  scientists realized that the earth would be much older  and that its core was still sufficiently hot to be liquid by 1915,  after having published a first article in alfred wegener was making serious arguments for the idea of continental drift in the first edition of the origin of continents and in that book (re-issued  in four successive editions up to the final one in 1936),  he noted how the east coast of south america and the west coast of africa looked as if they were once attached  wegener was not the first to note this  abraham ortelius  antonio snider-pellegrini,  eduard suess  roberto mantovani and frank bursley taylor preceded him just to mention a few   but he was the first to marshal significant fossil and paleo-topographical  and climatological evidence to support this simple observation  and was supported in this by researchers such as alex du toit   furthermore  when the rock strata of the margins of separate continents are very similar it suggests that these rocks were formed in the same way  implying that they were joined initially  for instance  parts of scotland and ireland contain rocks very similar to those found in newfoundland and new brunswick  furthermore  the caledonian mountains of europe and parts of the appalachian mountains of north america are very similar in structure and lithology however  his ideas were not taken seriously by many geologists  who pointed out that there was no apparent mechanism for continental drift  specifically  they did not see how continental rock could plow through the much denser rock that makes up oceanic crust  wegener could not explain the force that drove continental drift  and his vindication did not come until after his death in 1930.as  it was observed early that although granite existed on continents  seafloor seemed to be composed of denser basalt  the prevailing concept during the first half of the twentieth century was that there were two types of crust  named  sial   continental type crust  and  sima   oceanic type crust   furthermore  it was supposed that a static shell of strata was present under the continents  it therefore looked apparent that a layer of basalt  sial  underlies the continental rocks however  based on abnormalities in plumb line deflection by the andes in peru  pierre bouguer had deduced that less-dense  mountains must have a downward projection into the denser layer underneath  the concept that mountains had  roots  was confirmed by george b  airy a hundred years later  during study of himalayan gravitation  and seismic studies detected corresponding density variations  therefore  by the mid-1950s,  the question remained unresolved as to whether mountain roots were clenched in surrounding basalt or were floating on it like an iceberg during the 20th  century  improvements in and greater use of seismic instruments such as seismographs enabled scientists to learn that earthquakes tend to be concentrated in specific areas  most notably along the oceanic trenches and spreading ridges  by the late 1920s,  seismologists were beginning to identify several prominent earthquake zones parallel to the trenches that typically were inclined 40–60°  from the horizontal and extended several hundred kilometers into the earth  these zones later became known as wadati–benioff zones  or simply benioff zones  in honor of the seismologists who first recognized them  kiyoo wadati of japan and hugo benioff of the united states  the study of global seismicity greatly advanced in the 1960s  with the establishment of the worldwide standardized seismograph network to monitor the compliance of the 1963  treaty banning above-ground  testing of nuclear weapons  the much improved data from the wwssn instruments allowed seismologists to map precisely the zones of earthquake concentration worldwide meanwhile  debates developed around the phenomena of polar wander  since the early debates of continental drift  scientists had discussed and used evidence that polar drift had occurred because continents seemed to have moved through different climatic zones during the past  furthermore  paleomagnetic data had shown that the magnetic pole had also shifted during time  reasoning in an opposite way  the continents might have shifted and rotated  while the pole remained relatively fixed  the first time the evidence of magnetic polar wander was used to support the movements of continents was in a paper by keith runcorn in and successive papers by him and his students ted irving  who was actually the first to be convinced of the fact that paleomagnetism supported continental drift  and ken creer this was immediately followed by a symposium in tasmania in march in this symposium  the evidence was used in the theory of an expansion of the global crust  in this hypothesis the shifting of the continents can be simply explained by a large increase in size of the earth since its formation  however  this was unsatisfactory because its supporters could offer no convincing mechanism to produce a significant expansion of the earth  certainly there is no evidence that the moon has expanded in the past 3  billion years  other work would soon show that the evidence was equally in support of continental drift on a globe with a stable radius during the thirties up to the late fifties  works by vening-meinesz,  holmes  umbgrove  and numerous others outlined concepts that were close or nearly identical to modern plate tectonics theory  in particular  the english geologist arthur holmes proposed in 1920  that plate junctions might lie beneath the sea  and in 1928  that convection currents within the mantle might be the driving often  these contributions are forgotten because in 1947,  a team of scientists led by maurice ewing utilizing the woods hole oceanographic institution s research vessel atlantis and an array of instruments  confirmed the existence of a rise in the central atlantic ocean  and found that the floor of the seabed beneath the layer of sediments consisted of basalt  not the granite which is the main constituent of continents  they also found that the oceanic crust was much thinner than continental crust  all these new findings raised important and intriguing new data that had been collected on the ocean basins also showed particular characteristics regarding the bathymetry  one of the major outcomes of these datasets was that all along the globe  a system of mid-oceanic  ridges was detected  an important conclusion was that along this system  new ocean floor was being created  which led to the concept of the  great global rift   this was described in the crucial paper of bruce heezen which would trigger a real revolution in thinking  a profound consequence of seafloor spreading is that new crust was  and still is  being continually created along the oceanic ridges  therefore  heezen advocated the so-called   expanding earth  hypothesis of s  warren carey  see above   so  still the question remained  how can new crust be continuously added along the oceanic ridges without increasing the size of the earth  in reality  this question had been solved already by numerous scientists during the forties and the fifties  like arthur holmes  vening-meinesz,  coates and many others  the crust in excess disappeared along what were called the oceanic trenches  where so-called   subduction  occurred  therefore  when various scientists during the early sixties started to reason on the data at their disposal regarding the ocean floor  the pieces of the theory quickly fell into place the question particularly intrigued harry hammond hess  a princeton university geologist and a naval reserve rear admiral  and robert s  dietz  a scientist with the u s  coast and geodetic survey who first coined the term seafloor spreading  dietz and hess  the former published the same idea one year earlier in but priority belongs to hess who had already distributed an unpublished manuscript of his 1962  article by were among the small handful who really understood the broad implications of sea floor spreading and how it would eventually agree with the  at that time  unconventional and unaccepted ideas of continental drift and the elegant and mobilistic models proposed by previous workers like holmes in the same year  robert r  coats of the u s  geological survey described the main features of island arc subduction in the aleutian islands  his paper  though little noted  and even ridiculed  at the time  has since been called  seminal  and  prescient   in reality  it actually shows that the work by the european scientists on island arcs and mountain belts performed and published during the 1930s  up until the 1950s  was applied and appreciated also in the united states if the earth s crust was expanding along the oceanic ridges  hess and dietz reasoned like holmes and others before them  it must be shrinking elsewhere  hess followed heezen  suggesting that new oceanic crust continuously spreads away from the ridges in a conveyor belt–like motion  and  using the mobilistic concepts developed before  he correctly concluded that many millions of years later  the oceanic crust eventually descends along the continental margins where oceanic trenches – very deep  narrow canyons – are formed  e g  along the rim of the pacific ocean basin  the important step hess made was that convection currents would be the driving force in this process  arriving at the same conclusions as holmes had decades before with the only difference that the thinning of the ocean crust was performed using heezen s mechanism of spreading along the ridges  hess therefore concluded that the atlantic ocean was expanding while the pacific ocean was shrinking  as old oceanic crust is  consumed  in the trenches  like holmes and others  he thought this was done by thickening of the continental lithosphere  not  as now understood  by underthrusting at a larger scale of the oceanic crust itself into the mantle   new magma rises and erupts along the spreading ridges to form new crust  in effect  the ocean basins are perpetually being  recycled   with the creation of new crust and the destruction of old oceanic lithosphere occurring simultaneously  thus  the new mobilistic concepts neatly explained why the earth does not get bigger with sea floor spreading  why there is so little sediment accumulation on the ocean floor  and why oceanic rocks are much younger than continental rocks beginning in the 1950s,  scientists like victor vacquier  using magnetic instruments  magnetometers  adapted from airborne devices developed during world war ii to detect submarines  began recognizing odd magnetic variations across the ocean floor  this finding  though unexpected  was not entirely surprising because it was known that basalt—the iron-rich,  volcanic rock making up the ocean floor—contains a strongly magnetic mineral  magnetite  and can locally distort compass readings  this distortion was recognized by icelandic mariners as early as the late 18th  century  more important  because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties  these newly discovered magnetic variations provided another means to study the deep ocean floor  when newly formed rock cools  such magnetic materials recorded the earth s magnetic field at the time as more and more of the seafloor was mapped during the 1950s,  the magnetic variations turned out not to be random or isolated occurrences  but instead revealed recognizable patterns  when these magnetic patterns were mapped over a wide region  the ocean floor showed a zebra-like  pattern  one stripe with normal polarity and the adjoining stripe with reversed polarity  the overall pattern  defined by these alternating bands of normally and reversely polarized rock  became known as magnetic striping  and was published by ron g  mason and co-workers  in 1961,  who did not find  though  an explanation for these data in terms of sea floor spreading  like vine  matthews and morley a few years discovery of magnetic striping called for an explanation  in the early 1960s  scientists such as heezen  hess and dietz had begun to theorise that mid-ocean  ridges mark structurally weak zones where the ocean floor was being ripped in two lengthwise along the ridge crest  see the previous paragraph   new magma from deep within the earth rises easily through these weak zones and eventually erupts along the crest of the ridges to create new oceanic crust  this process  at first denominated the  conveyer belt hypothesis  and later called seafloor spreading  operating over many millions of years continues to form new ocean floor all across the 50,000  km-long  system of mid-ocean  ridges only four years after the maps with the  zebra pattern  of magnetic stripes were published  the link between sea floor spreading and these patterns was correctly placed  independently by lawrence morley  and by fred vine and drummond matthews  in now called the vine-matthews-morley  hypothesis  this hypothesis linked these patterns to geomagnetic reversals and was supported by several lines of explaining both the zebra-like  magnetic striping and the construction of the mid-ocean  ridge system  the seafloor spreading hypothesis  sfs  quickly gained converts and represented another major advance in the development of the plate-tectonics  theory  furthermore  the oceanic crust now came to be appreciated as a natural  tape recording  of the history of the geomagnetic field reversals  gmfr  of the earth s magnetic field  today  extensive studies are dedicated to the calibration of the normal-reversal  patterns in the oceanic crust on one hand and known timescales derived from the dating of basalt layers in sedimentary sequences  magnetostratigraphy  on the other  to arrive at estimates of past spreading rates and plate reconstructions after all these considerations  plate tectonics  or  as it was initially called  new global tectonics   became quickly accepted in the scientific world  and numerous papers followed that defined the concepts continental drift theory helps biogeographers to explain the disjunct biogeographic distribution of present-day  life found on different continents but having similar in particular  it explains the gondwanan distribution of ratites and the antarctic flora reconstruction is used to establish past  and future  plate configurations  helping determine the shape and make-up  of ancient supercontinents and providing a basis for paleogeography current plate boundaries are defined by their past plate boundaries within existing plates are identified from a variety of evidence  such as the presence of ophiolites that are indicative of vanished motion is believed to have begun around 3  to 3.5  billion years types of quantitative and semi-quantitative  information are available to constrain past plate motions  the geometric fit between continents  such as between west africa and south america is still an important part of plate reconstruction  magnetic stripe patterns provide a reliable guide to relative plate motions going back into the jurassic the tracks of hotspots give absolute reconstructions  but these are only available back to the older reconstructions rely mainly on paleomagnetic pole data  although these only constrain the latitude and rotation  but not the longitude  combining poles of different ages in a particular plate to produce apparent polar wander paths provides a method for comparing the motions of different plates through additional evidence comes from the distribution of certain sedimentary rock faunal provinces shown by particular fossil groups  and the position of orogenic movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up  of continents over time  including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents  the supercontinent columbia or nuna formed during a period of 2,000  to 1,800  million years ago and broke up about 1,500  to 1,300  million years the supercontinent rodinia is thought to have formed about 1  billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of earth s continents  and broken up into eight continents around 600  million years ago  the eight continents later re-assembled  into another supercontinent called pangaea  pangaea broke up into laurasia  which became north america and eurasia  and gondwana  which became the remaining continents  the himalayas  the world s tallest mountain range  are assumed to have been formed by the collision of two major plates  before uplift  they were covered by the tethys ocean depending on how they are defined  there are usually seven or eight  major  plates  african  antarctic  eurasian  north american  south american  pacific  and indo-australian.  the latter is sometimes subdivided into the indian and australian plates there are dozens of smaller plates  the seven largest of which are the arabian  caribbean  juan de fuca  cocos  nazca  philippine sea  and scotia the current motion of the tectonic plates is today determined by remote sensing satellite data sets  calibrated with ground station measurements the appearance of plate tectonics on terrestrial planets is related to planetary mass  with more massive planets than earth expected to exhibit plate tectonics  earth may be a borderline case  owing its tectonic activity to abundant water  silica and water form a deep eutectic  venus shows no evidence of active plate tectonics  there is debatable evidence of active tectonics in the planet s distant past  however  events taking place since then  such as the plausible and generally accepted hypothesis that the venusian lithosphere has thickened greatly over the course of several hundred million years  has made constraining the course of its geologic record difficult  however  the numerous well-preserved  impact craters have been utilized as a dating method to approximately date the venusian surface  since there are thus far no known samples of venusian rock to be dated by more reliable methods   dates derived are dominantly in the range 500  to 750  million years ago  although ages of up to 1,200  million years ago have been calculated  this research has led to the fairly well accepted hypothesis that venus has undergone an essentially complete volcanic resurfacing at least once in its distant past  with the last event taking place approximately within the range of estimated surface ages  while the mechanism of such an impressive thermal event remains a debated issue in venusian geosciences  some scientists are advocates of processes involving plate motion to some extent one explanation for venus s lack of plate tectonics is that on venus temperatures are too high for significant water to be the earth s crust is soaked with water  and water plays an important role in the development of shear zones  plate tectonics requires weak surfaces in the crust along which crustal slices can move  and it may well be that such weakening never took place on venus because of the absence of water  however  some remain convinced that plate tectonics is or was once active on this planet mars is considerably smaller than earth and venus  and there is evidence for ice on its surface and in its crust in the 1990s,  it was proposed that martian crustal dichotomy was created by plate tectonic scientists today disagree  and think that it was created either by upwelling within the martian mantle that thickened the crust of the southern highlands and formed or by a giant impact that excavated the northern marineris may be a tectonic made of the magnetic field of mars by the mars global surveyor spacecraft in 1999  showed patterns of magnetic striping discovered on this planet  some scientists interpreted these as requiring plate tectonic processes  such as seafloor however  their data fail a  magnetic reversal test   which is used to see if they were formed by flipping polarities of a global magnetic of the satellites of jupiter have features that may be related to plate-tectonic  style deformation  although the materials and specific mechanisms may be different from plate-tectonic  activity on earth  on 8  september 2014,  nasa reported finding evidence of plate tectonics on europa  a satellite of jupiter—the first sign of subduction activity on another world other than the largest moon of saturn  was reported to show tectonic activity in images taken by the huygens probe  which landed on titan on january 14,  earth-sized  planets  plate tectonics is more likely if there are oceans of water  however  in 2007,  two independent teams of researchers came to opposing conclusions about the likelihood of plate tectonics on larger with one team saying that plate tectonics would be episodic or and the other team saying that plate tectonics is very likely on super-earths  even if the planet is
