 temperate climate -  wikipediain geography  temperate or tepid latitudes of earth lie between the tropics and the polar these regions generally have more variety in temperature over the course of the year and more distinct changes between seasons compared with tropical climates  where such variations are often north temperate zone extends from the tropic of cancer  approximately 23.5°  north latitude  to the arctic circle  approximately 66.5°  north latitude   the south temperate zone extends from the tropic of capricorn  approximately 23.5°  south latitude  to the antarctic circle  at approximately 66.5°  south some climate classifications  the temperate zone is often divided into several smaller climate zones  based on latitude  these include humid subtropical climate  mediterranean climate  oceanic  and continental climate subtropical climates are generally located between 23.5°  and 35.0°  north or south latitude on the eastern or leeward sides of landmasses  this climate has long  generally hot  summers and short  mild winters  with annual rainfall often concentrated in the warmest part of the year  these climates may occur in southern asia  the southeastern united states  parts of eastern australia  and in eastern coastal south america mediterranean climates occur generally between 30°  and 42°  north and south latitude  on the western sides of landmasses  this climate has long hot summers and short mild winters  however  seasonal rainfall is the opposite of that of the subtropical humid type  with a winter or cool season rainfall peak being typical  these climates occur near the rimlands of the mediterranean sea  in western australia  in california  and in the southernmost areas of south africa the oceanic climates occur in the higher middle latitudes  between 45°  and 60°  north and south latitude  they are created by the onshore flow from the cool high latitude oceans to their west  this causes the climate to have cool summers and cool  but not cold  winters  these climates are frequently cloudy  annual rainfall is spread throughout the entire year  regions with this climate include western europe  northwestern north america  and parts of new zealand the continental climates occur in middle latitudes  between 35°  or 40°  and 55°.  these climates are normally inland or on leeward sides of landmasses  they feature warm to hot summers and cold winters  with a large interseasonal temperature variation  regions with this climate include northern temperate asia  the northern united states  southern canada  and parts of northeastern europe the vast majority of the world s human population resides in temperate zones  especially in the northern hemisphere  due to its greater mass of the richest temperate flora in the world is found in southern africa  where some 24,000  taxa  species and infraspecific taxa  have been is a large-scale  practice in the temperate regions due to the plentiful rainfall and warm summers  because most agricultural activity occurs in the spring and summer  cold winters have a small effect on agricultural production  extreme winters or summers have a huge impact on the productivity of regions have the majority of the world s population  which leads to large cities  there are a couple factors why the climate of large city landscapes differs from the climate of rural areas  one factor is the strength of the absorption rate of builds and asphalt  which is higher than natural land  the other large factor is the burning of fossil fuels from buildings and vehicles  these factors have led to the average climate of cities to be warmer than surrounding
