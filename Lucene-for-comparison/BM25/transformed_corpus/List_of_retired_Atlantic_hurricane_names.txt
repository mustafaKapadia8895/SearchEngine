 list of retired atlantic hurricane names -  wikipediathis is a cumulative list of previously used tropical cyclone  tropical storm and hurricane  names which have been indefinitely removed from reuse in the north atlantic region the naming of north atlantic tropical cyclones is currently under the oversight of the hurricane committee of the world meteorological organization  this group maintains six alphabetic lists of names  with one list used each year  this normally results in each name being reused every six years  however  in the case of a particularly deadly or damaging storm  that storm s name is retired  and a replacement starting with the same letter is selected to take its place  the decision whether to remove a name is made yearly at an annual session of the hurricane committee the practice of retiring storm names was begun by the united states weather bureau in 1955,  after major hurricanes carol  edna  and hazel struck the northeastern united states during the previous year  initially their names were retired for 10  years  after which time they could be reintroduced  however  in 1969,  the policy was changed to have the names retired indefinitely  in 1977,  the united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa  transferred control of the naming lists to the hurricane committee since the formal start of naming during the 1947  atlantic hurricane season  an average of one atlantic storm name has been retired each year  though many seasons  most recently 2014)  did not have any names retired  the deadliest storm to have its name retired was hurricane mitch  which caused over 10,000  fatalities when it struck central america during october 1998,  while the costliest storm was hurricane katrina  which caused over $108  billion in damage when it struck the u s  gulf coast in august 1]  the most recently retired storm name is hurricane otto  which struck panama  costa rica  and nicaragua in late-november  2016.by  1947,  tropical cyclones developing in the north atlantic ocean were named by the united states army air forces in private communications between weather centres and aircraft using the phonetic this practice continued until september 1950,  when the names started to be used publicly after three hurricanes  baker  dog  easy  had occurred simultaneously and caused confusion within the media and the over the next 2  years the public use of the phonetic alphabet to name systems continued before at the 1953  interdepartmental hurricane conference it was decided to start using a new list of female names during that season  as a second phonetic alphabet had been during the active but mild 1953  atlantic hurricane season  the names were readily used in the press with few objections recorded  as a result  the same names were reused during the next year with only one change  gilda for gail  over the next 6  years a new list of names was developed ahead of each season  before in 1960  forecasters developed four alphabetical sets and repeated them every four these new sets followed the example of the typhoon names and excluded names beginning with the letters q  u  x  y  and z  and keeping them to female names 1955,  it was decided to start retiring the names of significant tropical cyclones for 10  years after which they might be reintroduced  with the names carol and edna reintroduced ahead of the 1965  and 1968  hurricane seasons at the 1969  interdepartmental hurricane conference the naming lists were revised after it was decided that the names carol  edna and hazel  would be permanently retired because of their importance to the research it was also decided that any significant hurricane in the future would also be permanently ahead of the 1971  atlantic hurricane season  10  lists of hurricane names were inaugurated  by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  in 1977  it was decided that the world meteorological organization s hurricane committee  wmo  would control the names used  who subsequently decided that six lists of names would be used in the atlantic ocean from 1979  onwards with male names since 1979  the same six lists have been used by the united states national hurricane center  nhc  to name systems  with names of significant tropical cyclones retired from the lists permanently and replaced with new names as required at the following year s hurricane committee present  the name of any tropical cyclone may be retired or withdrawn from the list of names at the request of a member state  if it acquires notoriety for various reasons including the number of deaths  amount of damages or other the committee subsequently discuss the proposal and either through building consensus or a majority vote decides if the name should be retired or withdrawn  in march 2017,  members of the british caribbean territories proposed that a third retirement criterion be added  the tropical cyclone must have sustained winds of at least 96  mph (154  km h   this came in light of the retirement of tropical storm erika in 2015  which caused catastrophic flooding and mudslides in dominica without producing sustained tropical storm-force  winds on the island  no action has been taken on this proposal 1954  and 1959,  eight names were deemed significant enough to be retired for 10  years due to their impact  before being permanently retired after 1969.  there were no names retired after the 1956,  1958,  and 1959  collectively  these storms resulted in at least 2090  fatalities and over 7009205500000000000♠$2.06  billion in damage  the deadliest hurricane was hurricane hazel  which killed at least 701  people  while the costliest was hurricane diane  which caused 7008856000000000000♠us$856  million in damage in 1960,  four rotating lists of names were developed to avoid having to create new lists each year  while the practice of retiring any particularly damaging storm names for 10  years continued  with 11  names deemed significant enough to be retired during the at the 1969  hurricane warning conference  the national hurricane center requested that carol  edna  hazel  and inez be permanently retired due to their importance to the research this request was subsequently accepted and led to today s practice of retiring names of significant tropical cyclones there were no names retired after the 1962  and the 1968  2]  collectively  the 11  systems were responsible for over 9000  fatalities and in excess of 7009441000000000000♠us$4.41  billion in damage starting in 1979,  the world meteorological organization began assigning both male and female names to tropical this decade featured hurricanes david and frederic  the first male atlantic hurricane names to be retired  during this decade  9  storms were deemed significant enough to have their names retired  together these 9  systems caused at least 7009940800000000000♠$9.41  billion in damage  while more than 10,500  people lost their lives  no names were retired by the hurricane committee after the 1971,  1973,  or 1976  seasons after control of the naming scheme was turned over to the world meteorological organization s hurricane committee during the mid-1970s,  the 1980s  marked the least prolific decade in terms of the number of retired storms with 7  names warranting removal  between them the 7  systems caused over

hurricane committee after the 1981,  1982,  1984,  1986,  or 1987  seasons  which was the most of any decade since the introduction of the practice of retiring hurricane names during the 1990s,  the atlantic ocean moved into its active era  which led to more tropical cyclones forming during the hurricane seasons  the decade featured hurricane andrew which at the time was the costliest hurricane on record  and also hurricane mitch which is considered to be the deadliest tropical cyclone to have its name retired killing over 11,000  people in central america  a total of 15  names were retired in this decade  with seven of those during the 1995  and 1996  seasons  there were no names retired after the 1993,  1994  and 1997  seasons after the atlantic basin had moved into the warm phase of
