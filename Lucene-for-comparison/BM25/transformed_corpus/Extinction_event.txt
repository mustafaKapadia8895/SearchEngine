 extinction event -  wikipediaan extinction event  also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis  is a widespread and rapid decrease in the biodiversity on earth  such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of multicellular organisms  it occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the rate of speciation  because most diversity and biomass on earth is microbial  and thus difficult to measure  recorded extinction events affect the easily observed  biologically complex component of the biosphere rather than the total diversity and abundance of occurs at an uneven rate  based on the fossil record  the background rate of extinctions on earth is about two to five taxonomic families of marine animals every million years  marine fossils are mostly used to measure extinction rates because of their superior fossil record and stratigraphic range compared to land animals the great oxygenation event was probably the first major extinction event  since the cambrian explosion five further major mass extinctions have significantly exceeded the background extinction rate  the most recent and arguably best-known,  the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event  which occurred approximately 66  million years ago  ma   was a large-scale  mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of in addition to the five major mass extinctions  there are numerous minor ones as well  and the ongoing mass extinction caused by human activity is sometimes called the sixth mass extinctions seem to be a mainly phanerozoic phenomenon  with extinction rates low before large complex organisms of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540  million years range from as few as five to more than twenty  these differences stem from the threshold chosen for describing an extinction event as  major   and the data chosen to measure past diversity in a landmark paper published in 1982,  jack sepkoski and david m  raup identified five mass extinctions  they were originally identified as outliers to a general trend of decreasing extinction rates during the but as more stringent statistical tests have been applied to the accumulating data  it has been established that multicellular animal life has experienced five major and many minor mass the  big five  cannot be so clearly defined  but rather appear to represent the largest  or some of the largest  of a relatively smooth continuum of extinction the popularization of these five events  there is no definite line separating them from other extinction events  using different methods of calculating an extinction s impact can lead to other events featuring in the top older the fossil record gets  the more difficult it is to read  this is because it has been suggested that the apparent variations in marine biodiversity may actually be an artifact  with abundance estimates directly related to quantity of rock available for sampling from different time however  statistical analysis shows that this can only account for 50%  of the observed needed  and other evidence  such as fungal needed  provides reassurance that most widely accepted extinction events are real  a quantification of the rock exposure of western europe indicates that many of the minor events for which a biological explanation has been sought are most readily explained by sampling completed after the seminal 1982  paper has concluded that a sixth mass extinction event is ongoing more recent research has indicated that the end-capitanian  extinction event likely constitutes a separate extinction event from the permian–triassic extinction event  if so  it would be larger than many of the  big five  extinction events this is a list of extinction extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on earth  when dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another  it is rarely because the new dominant group is  superior  to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new example  mammaliformes   almost mammals   and then mammals existed throughout the reign of the dinosaurs  but could not compete for the large terrestrial vertebrate niches which dinosaurs monopolized  the end-cretaceous  mass extinction removed the non-avian  dinosaurs and made it possible for mammals to expand into the large terrestrial vertebrate niches  ironically  the dinosaurs themselves had been beneficiaries of a previous mass extinction  the end-triassic,  which eliminated most of their chief rivals  the crurotarsans another point of view put forward in the escalation hypothesis predicts that species in ecological niches with more organism-to-organism  conflict will be less likely to survive extinctions  this is because the very traits that keep a species numerous and viable under fairly static conditions become a burden once population levels fall among competing organisms during the dynamics of an extinction event furthermore  many groups which survive mass extinctions do not recover in numbers or diversity  and many of these go into long-term  decline  and these are often referred to as  dead clades was firmly of the opinion that biotic interactions  such as competition for food and space—the ‘struggle for existence’—were of considerably greater importance in promoting evolution and extinction than changes in the physical environment  he expressed this in the origin of species   species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting causes…and the most import of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered…physical conditions  namely the mutual relation of organism to organism-the  improvement of one organism entailing the improvement or extermination of has been suggested variously that extinction events occurred periodically  every 26  to 30  million or that diversity fluctuates episodically every ~62  million various ideas attempt to explain the supposed pattern  including the presence of a hypothetical companion star to the oscillations in the galactic plane  or passage through the milky way s spiral however  other authors have concluded the data on marine mass extinctions do not fit with the idea that mass extinctions are periodic  or that ecosystems gradually build up to a point at which a mass extinction is many of the proposed correlations have been argued to be others have argued that there is strong evidence supporting periodicity in a variety of and additional evidence in the form of coincident periodic variation in nonbiological geochemical extinctions are thought to result when a long-term  stress is compounded by a short term over the course of the phanerozoic  individual taxa appear to be less likely to become extinct at any which may reflect more robust food webs as well as less extinction-prone  species and other factors such as continental however  even after accounting for sampling bias  there does appear to be a gradual decrease in extinction and origination rates during the this may represent the fact that groups with higher turnover rates are more likely to become extinct by chance  or it may be an artefact of taxonomy  families tend to become more speciose  therefore less prone to extinction  over and larger taxonomic groups  by definition  appear earlier in geological has also been suggested that the oceans have gradually become more hospitable to life over the last 500  million years  and thus less vulnerable to mass but susceptibility to extinction at a taxonomic level does not appear to make mass extinctions more or less is still debate about the causes of all mass extinctions  in general  large extinctions may result when a biosphere under long-term  stress undergoes a short-term  an underlying mechanism appears to be present in the correlation of extinction and origination rates to diversity  high diversity leads to a persistent increase in extinction rate  low diversity to a persistent increase in origination rate  these presumably ecologically controlled relationships likely amplify smaller perturbations  asteroid impacts  etc   to produce the global effects good theory for a particular mass extinction should   i  explain all of the losses  not just focus on a few groups  such as dinosaurs    ii  explain why particular groups of organisms died out and why others survived   iii  provide mechanisms which are strong enough to cause a mass extinction but not a total extinction   iv  be based on events or processes that can be shown to have happened  not just inferred from the extinction it may be necessary to consider combinations of causes  for example  the marine aspect of the end-cretaceous  extinction appears to have been caused by several processes which partially overlapped in time and may have had different levels of significance in different parts of the and west (2006)  proposed a  press   pulse  model in which mass extinctions generally require two types of cause  long-term  pressure on the eco-system    press   and a sudden catastrophe   pulse   towards the end of the period of their statistical analysis of marine extinction rates throughout the phanerozoic suggested that neither long-term  pressure alone nor a catastrophe alone was sufficient to cause a significant increase in the extinction rate macleod summarized the relationship between mass extinctions and events which are most often cited as causes of mass extinctions  using data from courtillot et al  hallam and grieve et al  most commonly suggested causes of mass extinctions are listed below the formation of large igneous provinces by flood basalt events could have flood basalt events occur as pulses of activity punctuated by dormant periods  as a result  they are likely to cause the climate to oscillate between cooling and warming  but with an overall trend towards warming as the carbon dioxide they emit can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years it is speculated that massive volcanism caused or contributed to the end-permian,  end-triassic  and end-cretaceous  the correlation between gigantic volcanic events expressed in the large igneous provinces and mass extinctions was shown for the last 260  recently such possible correlation was extended for the whole phanerozoic are often clearly marked by worldwide sequences of contemporaneous sediments which show all or part of a transition from sea-bed  to tidal zone to beach to dry land – and where there is no evidence that the rocks in the relevant areas were raised by geological processes such as orogeny  sea-level  falls could reduce the continental shelf area  the most productive part of the oceans  sufficiently to cause a marine mass extinction  and could disrupt weather patterns enough to cause extinctions on land  but sea-level  falls are very probably the result of other events  such as sustained global cooling or the sinking of the mid-ocean  ridges.sea-level  falls are associated with most of the mass extinctions  including all of the  big five"—end-ordovician,  late devonian  end-permian,  end-triassic,  and end-cretaceous.a  study  published in the journal nature  online june 15,  2008)  established a relationship between the speed of mass extinction events and changes in sea level and the study suggests changes in ocean environments related to sea level exert a driving influence on rates of extinction  and generally determine the composition of life in the impact of a sufficiently large asteroid or comet could have caused food chains to collapse both on land and at sea by producing dust and particulate aerosols and thus inhibiting impacts on sulfur-rich  rocks could have emitted sulfur oxides precipitating as poisonous acid rain  contributing further to the collapse of food chains  such impacts could also have caused megatsunamis and or global forest fires most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the earth about 66  ma ago  but there is an ongoing dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the cretaceous–paleogene extinction global cooling could kill many polar and temperate species and force others to migrate towards the equator  reduce the area available for tropical species  often make the earth s climate more arid on average  mainly by locking up more of the planet s water in ice and snow  the glaciation cycles of the current ice age are believed to have had only a very mild impact on biodiversity  so the mere existence of a significant cooling is not sufficient on its own to explain a mass extinction it has been suggested that global cooling caused or contributed to the end-ordovician,  permian–triassic  late devonian extinctions  and possibly others  sustained global cooling is distinguished from the temporary climatic effects of flood basalt events or impacts this would have the opposite effects  expand the area available for tropical species  kill temperate species or force them to migrate towards the poles  possibly cause severe extinctions of polar species  often make the earth s climate wetter on average  mainly by melting ice and snow and thus increasing the volume of the water cycle  it might also cause anoxic events in the oceans  see below  global warming as a cause of mass extinction is supported by several recent most dramatic example of sustained warming is the paleocene–eocene thermal maximum  which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions  it has also been suggested to have caused the triassic–jurassic extinction event  during which 20%  of all marine families became extinct  furthermore  the permian–triassic extinction event has been suggested to have been caused by are composites in which a lattice of one substance forms a cage around another  methane clathrates  in which water molecules are the cage  form on continental shelves  these clathrates are likely to break up rapidly and release the methane if the temperature rises quickly or the pressure on them drops quickly—for example in response to sudden global warming or a sudden drop in sea level or even earthquakes  methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide  so a methane eruption   clathrate gun   could cause rapid global warming or make it much more severe if the eruption was itself caused by global warming the most likely signature of such a methane eruption would be a sudden decrease in the ratio of carbon-13  to carbon-12  in sediments  since methane clathrates are low in carbon-13;  but the change would have to be very large  as other events can also reduce the percentage of has been suggested that  clathrate gun  methane eruptions were involved in the end-permian  extinction   the great dying   and in the paleocene–eocene thermal maximum  which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions anoxic events are situations in which the middle and even the upper layers of the ocean become deficient or totally lacking in oxygen  their causes are complex and controversial  but all known instances are associated with severe and sustained global warming  mostly caused by sustained massive has been suggested that anoxic events caused or contributed to the ordovician–silurian  late devonian  permian–triassic and triassic–jurassic extinctions  as well as a number of lesser extinctions  such as the ireviken  mulde  lau  toarcian and cenomanian–turonian events   on the other hand  there are widespread black shale beds from the mid-cretaceous  which indicate anoxic events but are not associated with mass extinctions the bio-availability  of essential trace elements  in particular selenium  to potentially lethal lows has been shown to coincide with  and likely have contributed to  at least three mass extinction events in the oceans  i e  at the end of the ordovician  during the middle and late devonian  and at the end of the triassic  during periods of low oxygen concentrations very soluble selenate (se6+)  is converted into much less soluble selenide (se2+),  elemental se and organo-selenium  complexes  bio-availability  of selenium during these extinction events dropped to about 1%  of the current oceanic concentration  a level that has been proven lethal to many extant pavlov and arthur (2005)  have proposed that during the permian–triassic extinction event the warming also upset the oceanic balance between photosynthesising plankton and deep-water  sulfate-reducing  bacteria  causing massive emissions of hydrogen sulfide which poisoned life on both land and sea and severely weakened the ozone layer  exposing much of the life that still remained to fatal levels of uv overturn is a disruption of thermo-haline  circulation which lets surface water  which is more saline than deep water because of evaporation  sink straight down  bringing anoxic deep water to the surface and therefore killing most of the oxygen-breathing  organisms which inhabit the surface and middle depths  it may occur either at the beginning or the end of a glaciation  although an overturn at the start of a glaciation is more dangerous because the preceding warm period will have created a larger volume of anoxic other oceanic catastrophes such as regressions (sea-level  falls  and anoxic events  overturns do not leave easily identified  signatures  in rocks and are theoretical consequences of researchers  conclusions about other climatic and marine events it has been suggested that oceanic overturn caused or contributed to the late devonian and permian–triassic extinctions a nearby gamma-ray  burst  less than 6000  light-years  away  would be powerful enough to destroy the earth s ozone layer  leaving organisms vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation from the gamma ray bursts are fairly rare  occurring only a few times in a given galaxy per million it has been suggested that a supernova or gamma ray burst caused the end-ordovician  theory is that periods of increased geomagnetic reversals will weaken earth s magnetic field long enough to expose the atmosphere to the solar winds  causing oxygen ions to escape the atmosphere in a rate increased by 3–4  orders  resulting in a disastrous decrease in of the continents into some configurations can cause or contribute to extinctions in several ways  by initiating or ending ice ages  by changing ocean and wind currents and thus altering climate  by opening seaways or land bridges which expose previously isolated species to competition for which they are poorly adapted  for example  the extinction of most of south america s native ungulates and all of its large metatherians after the creation of a land bridge between north and south america   occasionally continental drift creates a super-continent  which includes the vast majority of earth s land area  which in addition to the effects listed above is likely to reduce the total area of continental shelf  the most species-rich  part of the ocean  and produce a vast  arid continental interior which may have extreme seasonal variations another theory is that the creation of the super-continent  pangaea contributed to the end-permian  mass extinction  pangaea was almost fully formed at the transition from mid-permian  to late-permian,  and the  marine genus diversity  diagram at the top of this article shows a level of extinction starting at that time which might have qualified for inclusion in the  big five  if it were not overshadowed by the  great dying  at the end of the other hypotheses have been proposed  such as the spread of a new disease  or simple out-competition  following an especially successful biological innovation  but all have been rejected  usually for one of the following reasons  they require events or processes for which there is no evidence  they assume mechanisms which are contrary to the available evidence  they are based on other theories which have been rejected or superseded scientists have been concerned that human activities could cause more plants and animals to become extinct than any point in the past  along with human-made  changes in climate  see above   some of these extinctions could be caused by overhunting  overfishing  invasive species  or habitat loss  a study published in may 2017  in proceedings of the national academy of sciences argued that a “biological annihilation” akin to a sixth mass extinction event is underway as a result of anthropogenic causes  such as over-population  and over-consumption.  the study suggested that as much as 50%  of the number of animal individuals that once lived on earth were already extinct  threatening the basis for human existence eventual warming and expanding of the sun  combined with the eventual decline of atmospheric carbon dioxide could actually cause an even greater mass extinction  having the potential to wipe out even microbes  where rising global temperatures caused by the expanding sun will gradually increase the rate of weathering  which in turn removes more and more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  when carbon dioxide levels get too low  perhaps at 50  ppm   all plant life will die out  although simpler plants like grasses and mosses can survive much longer  until co2  levels drop to 10  all photosynthetic organisms gone  atmospheric oxygen can no longer be replenished  and is eventually removed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere  perhaps from volcanic eruptions  eventually the loss of oxygen will cause all remaining aerobic life to die out via asphyxiation  leaving behind only simple anaerobic prokaryotes  when the sun becomes 10%  brighter in about a billion earth will suffer a moist greenhouse effect resulting in its oceans boiling away  while the earth s liquid outer core cools due to the inner core s expansion and causes the earth s magnetic field to shut down  in the absence of a magnetic field  charged particles from the sun will deplete the atmosphere and further increase the earth s temperature to an average of ~420  k (147  °c  296  °f  in 2.8  billion years  causing the last remaining life on earth to die out  this is the most extreme instance of a climate-caused  extinction event  since this will only happen late in the sun s life  such will cause the final mass extinction in earth s history  albeit a very long extinction impact of mass extinction events varied widely  after a major extinction event  usually only weedy species survive due to their ability to live in diverse later  species diversify and occupy empty niches  generally  biodiversity recovers 5  to 10  million years after the extinction event  in the most severe mass extinctions it may take 15  to 30  million worst event  the permian–triassic extinction event  devastated life on earth and is estimated to have killed off over 90%  of species  life seemed to recover quickly after the p-t  extinction  but this was mostly in the form of disaster taxa  such as the hardy lystrosaurus  the most recent research indicates that the specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems  with high biodiversity  complex food webs and a variety of niches  took much longer to recover  it is thought that this long recovery was due to the successive waves of extinction which inhibited recovery  as well as to prolonged environmental stress to organisms which continued into the early triassic  recent research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-triassic,  4m  to 6m  years after the and some writers estimate that the recovery was not complete until 30m  years after the p-t  extinction  i e  in the late subsequent to the p-t  extinction  there was an increase in provincialization  with species occupying smaller ranges – perhaps removing incumbents from niches and setting the stage for an eventual effects of mass extinctions on plants are somewhat harder to quantify  given the biases inherent in the plant fossil record  some mass extinctions  such as the end-permian)  were equally catastrophic for plants  whereas others  such as the end-devonian,  did not affect the of years before present
