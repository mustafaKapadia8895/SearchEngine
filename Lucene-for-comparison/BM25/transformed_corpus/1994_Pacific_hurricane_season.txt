 1994  pacific hurricane season -  wikipediathe 1994  pacific hurricane season was the final season of the eastern north pacific s most recent active string of hurricane seasons that unofficially started in 1981.  the season officially started on may 15,  1994,  in the eastern pacific  and on june 1,  1994,  in the central pacific  and lasted until november 30,  1994.  these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern pacific ocean  the first tropical cyclone formed on june 18,  while the last system dissipated on october this season  twenty-two  tropical cyclones formed in the north pacific ocean east of the dateline  with all but two becoming tropical storms or hurricanes  a total of 10  hurricanes occurred  including five major hurricanes of note in this season is an unusual spree of very intense storms  hurricanes emilia  gilma  john  and olivia all reached a pressure below 930  millibars  longevity-wise,  no tropical cyclone of any basin had previously persisted for as long as hurricane john  which lasted 31  days  elsewhere  hurricane rosa caused four casualties in mexico as the basin s lone landfalling tropical storm or hurricane  and later was responsible for flooding in texas this season  twenty-two  tropical cyclones formed in the north pacific ocean east of the dateline  all but two of them became tropical storms or hurricanes  in the eastern pacific region (140°w  to north america   nineteen tropical depressions formed  of which seventeen became tropical storms  nine further intensifying into hurricanes  and five ultimately reaching major hurricanes of category 3  intensity or higher on the saffir simpson these numbers are slightly above the long-term  averages of fifteen tropical storms  nine hurricanes  and four major the central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility (140°w  to the international date line   three depressions  two tropical storms  and one hurricane formed  overall  there were eleven tropical cyclones  eight tropical storms  five hurricanes  and three major hurricanes that formed or entered the central pacific these numbers are well above the long-term  average of four tropical cyclones  two hurricanes  one tropical storm  and two the exceptionally high activity was contributed to by an el niño ongoing at the only named storm to make landfall this year was hurricane which killed four people in western and forced over 400  to be other notable storms include hurricane olivia  a high-end  category 4  the three category 5  hurricanes emilia  gilma  and john  both john and hurricane li existed in two of the three basins  east  and west  of the pacific season marked the end of the northeastern pacific s most recent active period  which began in and includes the five most active pacific hurricane beginning in 1995,  multi-decadal  factors switched to a phase that suppresses pacific hurricane since then  pacific hurricane seasons have generally been below the lone abnormally active season since then was in 1997,  where a strong el nino event was 1994  pacific hurricane season set several records  first  three hurricanes reached category 5  intensity on the saffir-simpson  hurricane setting a record later tied in hurricane john lasted longer and spent more time tropical than any other tropical cyclone on earth in recorded eleven tropical cyclones entered or formed in the central pacific  a record shared with the 1992  season until the 2015  season broke the finally  of the four most intense hurricanes recorded in the central pacific  three of them occurred this season began with the formation of tropical depression one-e  on june 18  and ended with the dissipation of tropical depression nona on october no named systems formed in may  three in june  four in july  five in august  six in september  two in october  and none in the total length of the season  from the formation of the first depression to the dissipation of the last  was 130  cyclone energy  ace  is a measure of how active a hurricane season is  it is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force  winds every six hours  summing the results  and dividing that total by 104.  as a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force  winds until it becomes a tropical storm  tropical depressions are not included in these tables  for all storms  ace is given to three significant figures  the ace in the east pacific proper (140°w  to north america  is given  the ace in the central pacific  the international date line to 140°w)  is given in brackets  the table includes the ace for li and john only during those storm s time east of the dateline  their ace west of the dateline is part of the totals of the 1994  typhoon season the national hurricane center uses ace to rank hurricane seasons as above-normal,  near-normal,  and below-normal.  it defines below-normal  as having an ace less than 95*104  kt2  kt2;  it defines above normal as having an ace above 150*104  kt2  along with the numbers of any two of the following above average  tropical storms (15),  hurricanes (9),  or major hurricanes (4);  it defines near-normal  as having an ace between 100*104  kt2  and 150*104  kt2,  or an ace above 150*104  kt2  with fewer than two of the numbers of the following above average  tropical storms (15),  hurricanes (9),  or major hurricanes season has a total of seventeen tropical storms  nine hurricanes  and five major hurricanes  the total ace of this season is 185*104  kt2.  this qualifies this season as depression one-e  formed from an area of disturbed weather on june 18.  it strengthened to tropical storm aletta the next day  it continued intensifying and reached its peak intensity on june 20.  vertical wind shear began to weaken the storm thereafter  the weakening trend continued  weakening aletta to a depression on june 21.  the system dissipated june 23.  aletta s remnant low  however  could be tracked on satellite images for days following the storm  the low finally dissipated north of aletta never affected land  and no damage or casualties were depression two-e  formed on june 27  about 575  miles (925  km  south-southwest  of the tip of the baja california peninsula  the depression headed west-northwest,  gradually turned to the northwest  and strengthened into tropical storm bud on june 27.  early the next day  bud peaked in intensity  shear caused by a nearby upper level low slowly weakened bud  later on june 28,  a second center of circulation developed  the two centers started a fujiwhara interaction  the second center then became dominant and the first one vanished  this confused structure is similar to what happened to 1993's  tropical storm arlene  this confused structure also weakened bud to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the same day the second center formed  bud then headed westward over cool waters and dissipated on june tropical storm bud spent its entire life over the open ocean far from land areas  no casualties or damage was tropical depression that would be carlotta formed on june 28.  it quickly became tropical storm carlotta  and a large eye became visible  because of this  the nhc upgraded the storm to a hurricane  carlotta peaked in intensity on july 1,  as a 105  mph (169  km h  hurricane  it gradually weakened as it moved into cooler waters  dissipating on july 5.  carlotta did not threaten buffeted socorro island with sustained winds of 39  mph (63  km h  on june other than there  carlotta caused no damage or july 8,  a disturbance located about 1,000  miles (1,600  km  southwest of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula developed a circulation and became tropical depression four-e.  convection increased  and the depression strengthened into tropical storm daniel  upper-level  outflow improved  and daniel peaked in intensity on july 9.  daniel slowly declined as it continued westward  it entered the central pacific on july 11.  wind shear weakened daniel as it approached the big island  and by july 15  had degenerated into an open daniel was approaching hawaii  moderate surf of 4  to 6  feet (1.2  to 1.8  m  impacted the south and southeast shores of the big island on july 13  and 14.  daniel s remnants also passed about 100  miles (160  km  south of south point  hawaii  on july 15.  that day  they caused rainfall on windward slopes of the big island locally reaching 5  inches (130  no reports of damage or casualties were july 16,  an area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave organized into tropical depression five-e.  it strengthened into tropical storm emilia later that day  it moved west-northwest  and strengthened into a it entered the central pacific on july 17.  it continued intensifying  reaching category 5  intensity on july the first category 5  pacific hurricane since ava  emilia started weakening quickly on july 21.  it weakened to a tropical storm on july 23  and dissipated two days passed south of the hawaiian islands  producing swells of 6  to 10  feet (1.8  to 3.0  m  in height near the puna and ka‘ū coasts  winds caused minor damage  and rain was no one was tropical depression formed on july 19.  later that day  it strengthened into tropical storm fabio  fabio headed generally west or it entered the central pacific as a tropical depression  and dissipated on july remnants brought locally heavy rainfall to hawaii  reaching 3  to 4  inches (76  to 102  no one was killed and there was no of a tropical wave organized into a tropical depression on july 21.  it headed westward and out to sea  strengthening into a tropical storm the next day  gilma rapidly strengthened and became a hurricane exactly one day after it was named  it continued to intensify as it entered the central pacific  shortly after entering the central pacific  gilma reached category 5  intensity on the saffir-simpson  hurricane scale  the second of the it then suddenly weakened for unexplained reasons  and weakened into a tropical storm on july 27.  it became a depression three days after that and dissipated on july hurricane gilma had minor impact on johnston atoll  that atoll received light rain  wind gusts to near gale and no casualties or damage were gilma was the second most-intense  pacific at the time  as of 2016,  it remains the ninth-most  intense  gilma is also the strongest july storm in the eastern or central tropical disturbance southwest of cabo san lucas organized into tropical depression eight-e  on july it headed west-northwest  without strengthening much  and crossed into the central pacific on august eight-e  developed a second center of circulation  which became and then became bound up in the intertropical convergence eight-e  then became disorganized  with multiple centers of and advisories were discontinued on august 5.  the depression s remains continued their westward path well south of the hawaiian islands  the depression regenerated on august 8.  it soon strengthened into a tropical storm and was named which is hawaiian for li approached the dateline on its generally westward heading  just before crossing  it intensified into a minimal category 1  hurricane  it crossed the dateline on august 12  and became a storm in the 1994  pacific typhoon wind shear from a tropical upper-tropospheric  trough weakened back into a tropical storm as it crossed the dateline  and the joint typhoon warning center downgraded li with its first li stayed a tropical storm until august 16,  where it weakened into a tropical depression  the system then began recurving  and dissipated on august a weakening tropical depression li caused showers on wake island  other than there  li had no impact on any land  and no casualties or damage were li is one of only seven tropical cyclones to exist on all three tropical cyclone basins in the pacific ocean  it is also one of only six systems to form as a depression in the east pacific but be named in the central  the others are lala  iniki  lana  ela and august 7,  a tropical depression formed from a tropical wave a few hundred miles south of baja california  it became tropical storm hector quickly  and as it paralleled the coast of mexico  it began to weaken  dissipating on august 10.  no damage was reported storm hector was forecast to approach the baja california peninsula  a tropical storm watch was issued for part of the peninsula on august 8.  it was lifted later the same hector s most significant impact was rain  the tropical storm dumped rain along a discontinuous zone of coastal and inland mexico  the highest point maxima were 7.87  inches (200  mm  at cerro de ortega ixtlahua and 7.60  inches (193  mm  at no damage or casualties were area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression on august 9  while located 740  miles (1,190  km  southeast of hilo  hawaii  the depression moved westward without organizing  and dissipated on august from the system produced heavy rainfall over the island of hawaii  totaling to over 15  inches (380  the flooding closed all major roads in hilo  and was considered the worst flooding in 40  years  the rainfall destroyed two homes and damaged 214,  14  severely  it also damaged roads and businesses  damage throughout the island totaled to $5  million (1994  usd  $8.08  million 2017  flooding occurred in maui as well  where landslides blocked portions of the hana one-c's  point maximum of 15  in (380  mm  makes it hawaii s seventh wettest known tropical cyclone a disturbance that was part of the intertropical convergence zone developed several centers of circulation  after it organized  it separated from the itcz and became tropical depression eleven-e  on august 10  while the system was about 690  miles (1,110  km  south-southeast  of the southern tip of the baja california it was upgraded to tropical storm ileana at the second at the same time as john  the next an eye appeared  and ileana became a hurricane on august 12.  it began weakening almost immediately thereafter  as it passed over cooler waters and encountered increasing wind shear  ileana was a tropical storm on august 13,  and the next day it was a dissipating swirl low-level  clouds located about 520  miles (840  km  west of punta although ileana paralleled the coast of mexico  watches and warnings were not issued because winds of tropical storm-force  were not expected to affect land  no one was killed and there was no damage reported in association with this depression ten-e  formed on august 11  south of mexico  it headed generally westward  and was upgraded into a tropical storm twelve hours after it formed and was named john  john fluctuated in strength as it headed west  always managing to stay at tropical storm strength  on august 20,  steady intensification began  and john was a major hurricane when it entered the central pacific  it continued westward  reaching category 5  intensity on august 23.  it passed around 245  miles (394  km  south of hawaii  and passed just north of johnston atoll on august john stayed at hurricane intensity until it crossed the dateline on august 28,  becoming a typhoon of the 1994  pacific typhoon after weakening into a tropical storm  john recurved  looped  and recurved it reintensified  and was a hurricane when it recrossed the dateline to reenter the central pacific  john headed north-northeast  until it went extratropical on september thirty one days after it of the hurricane  the 1100  people at johnston atoll evacuated  on the atoll  john caused $15  million (1994  usd  $24.2  million 2017  usd  in damage  no deaths were reported  other than on johnston  hurricane john had minor effects in hawaii  its remnants also affected john was the longest lasting and farthest traveling tropical cyclone on earth in recorded it is also one of six tropical cyclones to exist in all three basins of the pacific ocean  an uncommon west-to-east  dateline crosser  and one of the few tropical cyclone to cross the dateline more than august 14,  an area of convection organized enough to be considered a tropical depression  it was steered by john s circulation  and it was never expected to strengthen much because it was close to cool the cyclone drifted north  then northeast  north again  northwest  and then the national hurricane center declared the depression dissipated on august the depression had no effects august 28,  tropical depression thirteen-e  formed about 1,300  miles (2,100  km  southwest of cabo san lucas  mexico  it was named tropical storm kristy on august 30.  as it crossed into the central pacific  a banding-type  eye formed and it became a twelve hours later  it reached category 2  intensity  kristy weakened steadily from that point due to wind shear  it passed about 300  miles (480  km  south of hawaii  and dissipated on september the lowest central pressure of kristy is unknown  the last estimate was made when kirsty was still a tropical it approached the hawaiian islands  a high surf advisory and a high wind warning were issued for the big island of hawaii  no damage or deaths were reported in association with this its remnants crossed 180th  meridian very early on september 7  and was absorbed by a tropical depression which became typhoon melissa in the western pacific basin the same tropical wave that spawned tropical depression five in the atlantic became tropical depression fourteen-e  on september 3.  it quickly became tropical storm lane  a high pressure ridge centered itself north of lane  keeping the storm on a westward track  this brought lane into very favorable conditions  and lane intensified  when the tropical storm reached hurricane strength  it entered a phase of rapid intensification  reaching winds of about 135  mph (217  km h   making it a category four hurricane  the high pressure ridge shifted eastward  and allowed lane to enter unfavorable conditions  lane dissipated on september tropical disturbance became tropical depression two-c  on september 6.  it reached tropical storm strength the next day  being named the name mele means  song  in the hawaiian language and is also the hawaiian form of mele headed west-northwest  and weakened back into a tropical depression on september  it dissipated later that day without formed from a weak disturbance on september 15.  it strengthened slightly into tropical storm miriam  and dissipated on september 21,  having led an uneventful life without impact  in an interesting occurrence  the low-level  remnants of miriam were still visible for weeks after the storm dissipated near tropical depression formed on september 19,  and became tropical storm norman the next day  after tracking northwest  it began to turn north in response to a trough  and convection began to diminish  norman dissipated on september 22  without having ever affected olivia ultimately formed from a disturbance that had separated from the intertropical convergence zone and become distinct by september 19.  the disturbance slowly headed westward and it organized into a tropical depression on september 22  while located about 720  miles (1,160  km  south of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula  the depression headed west-northwestwards  and strengthened into tropical storm olivia on september 22.  it steadily intensified and was a hurricane on september 24.  it then rapidly strengthened into a powerful major hurricane  it slowly curled to the northwest as it was observed by noaa research olivia peaked in intensity on september 25.  meanwhile  a large cyclone off the extreme southern part of california induced a northward path  as olivia started a small anticyclonic loop  wind shear began to weaken the hurricane  when olivia was finished the loop  it had weakened to a tropical storm  it then headed westward  it weakened into a tropical depression on september 28  and dissipated the next day  no impact was the time  olivia was the third-most  intense pacific hurricane on record  it has since dropped to eleventh  the storm also had the lowest barometric pressure of a category 4  pacific hurricane on record  in 2001,  hurricane juliette joined olivia as the most intense cat  4  on record  in 2014,  hurricane odile beat both storms when it attained a minimum pressure of 918  mbars  olivia was also the most intense september hurricane  since  hurricane linda beat olivia  olivia remains the third most intense september nearly stationary cluster of thunderstorms and convection that had been hanging around since september 15  and escaped destruction by tropical storm miriam organized into tropical depression eighteen-e  on september 24.  it was located between miriam s remnants and the developing olivia  it became tropical storm paul on the afternoon of september 25.  it peaked in intensity on september 27.  then  upper outflow from the nearby olivia started shearing the tropical cyclone  paul had been completely destroyed by september the tropical cyclone never threatened land  and consequently  no damage or deaths were area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression at midday on october 8.  it had trouble organizing  and advisories were discontinued for a while  the cyclone finally became a tropical storm on october 11  and was named rosa  it moved glacially  but eventually a trough steered rosa north and then northeast  rosa intensified quickly  peaking at category 2  intensity just before landfall near la concepción on the morning of october 14.  rosa quickly decayed over the mountains of mexico  and its cloud shield rapidly accelerated northward through the united states  spreading october 12,  a hurricane watch was issued for the coast from culiacán to manzanillo and the baja california peninsula south of latitude 24°n.  at the same time  a tropical storm warning was issued from manzanillo to tepic  on october 14,  a hurricane warning was issued for the coast between culiacán and cabo corrientes  jalisco  and a tropical storm warning south of cabo corrientes to manzanillo  all watches and warnings were lifted later that deaths  two in each of nayarit and durango  were reported  four people were missing in sinaloa  all of the deaths were due to drowning  more than 100,000  people had their homes damaged in nayarit  telephone poles and power lines were downed in sinaloa  rain caused landslides and flash-flooding  in mountainous in jalisco  mudslides forced the evacuation of 400  people from two coastal the highest rainfall total in mexico was 14.09  inches (358  mm  at mesa de pedro the moisture rosa sent into the united states was a contributing factor in record rains in parts of southeastern texas from october 15  to 19.  those rains caused flooding that killed 22  people  destroyed over 3000  homes  and caused us$700  million in depression three-c  formed on october 21  in the central pacific basin  it traveled westward for about 4  days before strengthening to tropical storm nona on october the name  nona  is hawaiian for the latin name spelled the same nona immediately weakened back into a tropical depression  upper-level  westerlies from a nearby trough destroyed the depression on october 26.  no deaths or damage were nona was a tropical storm for six the minimum possible to the joint typhoon warning center and japan meteorological agency  on october 21  a tropical depression formed west of the international dateline  and soon it exited cphc s area of however  this storm wasn t included into cphc database  as it entered into western pacific  it strengthened as a tropical storm and received the name yuri the following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeastern pacific ocean during 1994.  names that were not assigned this season are marked in gray  no names were retired  so this same list was used again in the 2000  season  this is the same list used for the 1988  season except for ileana  which replaced iva and was used for the first time in 1994.for  storms that form in the central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility  encompassing the area between 140  degrees west and the international date line  all names are used in a series of four rotating lists  the next four names that were slated for use in 1994  are shown below  three of them  li  mele  and nona  were used throughout the course of the year this is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1994  pacific hurricane season  it includes their duration  names  landfall s   denoted in parentheses  damages  and death totals  deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect  an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident   but were still related to that storm  damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical  a wave  or a low  and all the damage figures are in 1994  usd at peak intensity1992  (295)2015  (286)1990  (250)1978  (207)1983  (206)1993  (201)2014
