 marine mammal -  wikipediamarine mammals are aquatic mammals that rely on the ocean and other marine ecosystems for their existence  they include animals such as seals  whales  manatees  sea otters and polar bears  they do not represent a distinct taxon or systematic grouping  but rather have a polyphyletic relation due to convergent evolution  as in they do not have an immediate common ancestor  they are also unified by their reliance on the marine environment for feeding marine mammal adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species  both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers  seals and sea-lions  are semiaquatic  they spend the majority of their time in the water  but need to return to land for important activities such as mating  breeding and molting  in contrast  both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living  their diet varies considerably as well  some may eat zooplankton  others may eat fish  squid  shellfish  sea-grass  and a few may eat other mammals  while the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land  their roles in various ecosystems are large  especially concerning the maintenance of marine ecosystems  through processes including the regulation of prey populations  this role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23%  of marine mammal species are currently threatened marine mammals were first hunted by aboriginal peoples for food and other resources  many were also the target for commercial industry  leading to a sharp decline in all populations of exploited species  such as whales and seals  commercial hunting lead to the extinction of †steller s sea cow and the †caribbean monk seal  after commercial hunting ended  some species  such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal  have rebounded in numbers  conversely  other species  such as the north atlantic right whale  are critically endangered  other than hunting  marine mammals can be killed as bycatch from fisheries  where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve  increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals  habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals and their ability to find and catch food  noise pollution  for example  may adversely affect echolocating mammals

or systematic grouping  but instead have a polyphyletic relationship  they are also unified by their reliance on the marine environment for despite the diversity in morphology seen between groups  improved foraging efficiency has been the main driver in their the level of dependence on the marine environment for existence varies considerably with species  for example  dolphins and whales are completely dependent on the marine environment for all stages of their life  seals feed in the ocean but breed on land  and polar bears must feed on twenty three percent of marine mammal species are cetaceans became aquatic around 50  million years ago based on molecular and morphological research  the cetaceans genetically and morphologically fall firmly within the artiodactyla (even-toed  the term  cetartiodactyla  reflects the idea that whales evolved within the ungulates  the term was coined by merging the name for the two orders  cetacea and artiodactyla  into a single word  under this definition  the closest living land relative of the whales and dolphins is thought to be the the sea cows  became aquatic around 40  million years ago  the first appearance of sirenians in the fossil record was during the early eocene  and by the late eocene  sirenians had significantly diversified  inhabitants of rivers  estuaries  and nearshore marine waters  they were able to spread rapidly  the most primitive sirenian  †prorastomus  was found in unlike other marine mammals which originated from the old world  such as the first known quadrupedal sirenian was †pezosiren from the early the earliest known sea cows  of the families †prorastomidae and †protosirenidae  were both confined to the eocene  and were pig-sized,  four-legged,  amphibious the first members of dugongidae appeared by the end of the at this point  sea cows were fully split from other caniforms 50  mya during the eocene  their evolutionary link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007  discovery of †puijila darwini in early miocene deposits in nunavut  canada  like a modern otter  †puijila had a long tail  short limbs and webbed feet instead of the lineages of otariidae  eared seals  and odobenidae  walrus  split almost 28  phocids  earless seals  are known to have existed for at least 15  and molecular evidence supports a divergence of the monachinae  monk seals  and phocinae lineages 22  evidence indicates the sea otter  enhydra  lineage became isolated in the north pacific approximately two mya  giving rise to the now-extinct  †enhydra macrodonta and the modern sea otter  enhydra lutris  the sea otter evolved initially in northern hokkaidō and russia  and then spread east to the aleutian islands  mainland alaska  and down the north american coast  in comparison to cetaceans  sirenians  and pinnipeds  which entered the water approximately 50,  40,  and 20  mya  respectively  the sea otter is a relative newcomer to marine life  in some respects though  the sea otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds  which must haul out on land or ice to give bears are thought to have diverged from a population of brown bears  ursus arctos  that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the or from the eastern part of siberia   from kamchatka and the kolym the oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000  to 110,000-year-old  jaw bone  found on prince charles foreland in the mitochondrial dna  mtdna  of the polar bear diverged from the brown bear roughly 150,000  years further  some clades of brown bear  as assessed by their mtdna  are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown meaning that the polar bear might not be considered a species under some species mammals are widely distributed throughout the globe  but their distribution is patchy and coincides with the productivity of the species richness peaks at around 40°  latitude  both north and south  this corresponds to the highest levels of primary production around north and south america  africa  asia and australia  total species range is highly variable for marine mammal species  on average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth  of the indian the variation observed in range size is a result of the different ecological requirements of each species and their ability to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions  the high degree of overlap between marine mammal species richness and areas of human impact on the environment is of marine mammals  such as seals and sea otters  inhabit the coast  seals  however  also use a number of terrestrial habitats  both continental and island  in temperate and tropical areas  they haul-out  on to sandy and pebble beaches  rocky shores  shoals  mud flats  tide pools and in sea caves  some species also rest on man-made  structures  like piers  jetties  buoys and oil platforms  seals may move further inland and rest in sand dunes or vegetation  and may even climb most cetaceans live in the open ocean  and species like the sperm whale may dive to depths of −1,000  to −2,500  feet (−300  to −760  m  in search of sirenians live in shallow coastal waters  usually living 30  feet (9.1  m  below sea level  however  they have been known to dive to −120  feet (−37  m  to forage deep-water  sea otters live in protected areas  such as rocky shores  kelp forests  and barrier although they may reside among drift ice or in sandy  muddy  or silty marine mammals seasonally migrate  annual ice contains areas of water that appear and disappear throughout the year as the weather changes  and seals migrate in response to these changes  in turn  polar bears must follow their prey  in hudson bay  james bay  and some other areas  the ice melts completely each summer  an event often referred to as "ice-floe  breakup    forcing polar bears to go onto land and wait through the months until the next freeze-up.  in the chukchi and beaufort seas  polar bears retreat each summer to the ice further north that remains frozen seals may also migrate to other environmental changes  such as el niño  and traveling seals may use various features of their environment to reach their destination including geomagnetic fields  water and wind currents  the position of the sun and moon and the taste and temperature of the baleen whales famously migrate very long distances into tropical waters to give birth and raise possibly to prevent predation by killer the gray whale has the longest recorded migration of any mammal  with one traveling 14,000  miles (23,000  km  from the sea of okhotsk to the baja during the winter  manatees living at the northern end of their range migrate to warmer mammals have a number of physiological and anatomical features to overcome the unique challenges associated with aquatic living  some of these features are very species specific  marine mammals have developed a number of features for efficient locomotion such as torpedo shaped bodies to reduce drag  modified limbs for propulsion and steering  tail flukes and dorsal fins for propulsion and marine mammals are adept at thermoregulation using dense fur or blubber  circulatory adjustments (counter-current  heat exchangers   torpedo shaped bodies  reduced appendages  and large size to prevent heat mammals are able to dive for long periods of time  both pinnipeds and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store oxygen to support deep diving  other important reservoirs include muscles  blood  and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold a high concentration of oxygen  they are also capable of bradycardia  reduced heart rate   and vasoconstriction  shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart  to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen if oxygen is depleted  marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis of the cells involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged travels differently through water  and therefore marine mammals have developed adaptations to ensure effective communication  prey capture  and predator the most notable adaptation is the development of echolocation in whales and toothed whales emit a focused beam of high-frequency  clicks in the direction that their head is pointing  sounds are generated by passing air from the bony nares through the phonic 112  these sounds are reflected by the dense concave bone of the cranium and an air sac at its base  the focused beam is modulated by a large fatty organ known as the  melon   this acts like an acoustic lens because it is composed of lipids of differing mammals have evolved a wide variety of features for feeding  which are mainly seen in their dentition  for example  the cheek teeth of pinnipeds and odontocetes are specifically adapted to capture fish and squid  in contrast  baleen whales have evolved baleen plates to filter feed plankton and small fish from the bears  otters  and fur seals have fur  one of the defining mammalian features  that is long  oily  and waterproof in order to trap air to provide insulation  in contrast  other marine mammals – such as whales  dolphins  porpoises  manatees  dugongs  and walruses – have lost long fur in favor of a thick  dense epidermis and a thickened fat layer  blubber  in response to hydrodynamic requirements  wading and bottom-feeding  animals  such as manatees  need to be heavier than water in order to keep contact with the floor or to stay submerged  surface-living  animals  such as sea otters  need the opposite  and free-swimming  animals living in open waters  such as dolphins  need to be neutrally buoyant in order to be able to swim up and down the water column  typically  thick and dense bone is found in bottom feeders and low bone density is associated with mammals living in deep water  some marine mammals  such as polar bears and otters  have retained four weight-bearing  limbs and can walk on land like fully terrestrial cetaceans are carnivorous and predatory  toothed whales mostly feed on fish and cephalopods  followed by crustaceans and bivalves  some may forage with other kinds of animals  such as other species of whales or certain species of one common feeding method is herding  where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume  known as a bait ball  individual members then take turns plowing through the ball  feeding on the stunned coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on other whales with a blunt snout and reduced dentition rely on suction though carnivorous  they house gut flora similar to that of terrestrial herbivores  probably a remnant of their herbivorous whales use their baleen plates to sieve plankton  among others  out of the water  there are two types of methods  lunge-feeding  and gulp-feeding.  lunge-feeders  expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the original volume of the whale itself by inflating their mouth  this causes grooves on their throat to expand  increasing the amount of water the mouth can they ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed  but this is only energy-effective  when used against a large gulp-feeders  swim with an open mouth  filling it with water and prey  prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale s interest  be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it  and be slow enough so that it cannot are the only marine animals that are capable of lifting and turning over rocks  which they often do with their front paws when searching for the sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for it is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its under each foreleg  sea otters have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface  this pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams  an example of tool the sea otters eat while floating on their backs  using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and mostly feed on fish and cephalopods  followed by crustaceans and bivalves  and then zooplankton and warm-blooded  prey  like sea most species are generalist feeders  but a few are they typically hunt non-schooling  fish  slow-moving  or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey when in groups  solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters  bays and rivers  when large schools of fish or squid are available  pinnipeds hunt cooperatively in large groups  locating and herding their prey  some species  such as california and south american sea lions  may forage with cetaceans and sea polar bear is the most carnivorous species of bear  and its diet primarily consists of ringed  pusa hispida  and bearded  erignathus barbatus  polar bears hunt primarily at the interface between ice  water  and air  they only rarely catch seals on land or in open the polar bear s most common hunting method is the bear locates a seal breathing hole using its sense of smell  and crouches nearby for a seal to appear  when the seal exhales  the bear smells its breath  reaches into the hole with a forepaw  and drags it out onto the ice  the polar bear also hunts by stalking seals resting on the ice  upon spotting a seal  it walks to within 100  yards (90  m   and then crouches  if the seal does not notice  the bear creeps to within 30  to 40  feet (9  to 10  m  of the seal and then suddenly rushes to a third hunting method is to raid the birth lairs that female seals create in the they may also feed on are referred to as  sea cows  because their diet consists mainly of sea-grass.  when eating  they ingest the whole plant  including the roots  although when this is impossible they feed on just the a wide variety of seagrass has been found in dugong stomach contents  and evidence exists they will eat algae when seagrass is west indian manatees eat up to 60  different species of plants  as well as fish and small invertebrates to a lesser otters are a classic example of a keystone species  their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest  they keep the population of certain benthic  sea floor  herbivores  particularly sea urchins  in check  sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp  causing the kelp to drift away and die  loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem  north pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into urchin barrens  with abundant sea urchins and no kelp reintroduction of sea otters to british columbia has led to a dramatic improvement in the health of coastal and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the aleutian and commander islands and the big sur coast of however  some kelp forest ecosystems in california have also thrived without sea otters  with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other the role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and apex predator affects prey population dynamics and defense tactics  such as the polar bear is the apex predator within its several animal species  particularly arctic foxes  vulpes lagopus  and glaucous gulls  larus hyperboreus   routinely scavenge polar bear the relationship between ringed seals and polar bears is so close that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears  while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed the evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between arctic and antarctic seals  compared to the antarctic  where there is no major surface predator  arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual  appear more restless when hauled out on the ice  and rarely defecate on the the fur of arctic pups is white  presumably to provide camouflage from predators  whereas antarctic pups all have dark whales are apex predators throughout their global distribution  and can have a profound effect on the behavior and population of prey species  their diet is very broad and they can feed on many vertebrates in the ocean including rays  sharks  even white large baleen and nearly 20  species of the predation of whale calves may be responsible for annual whale migrations to calving grounds in more tropical waters  where the population of killer whales is much lower than in polar waters  prior to whaling  it is thought that great whales were a major food source  however  after their sharp decline  killer whales have since expanded their diet  leading to the decline of smaller marine a decline in aleutian islands sea otter populations in the 1990s  was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation  although with no direct evidence  the decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbor seal and steller sea lion populations  the killer whale s preferred prey  which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey  now reduced by industrial 2010  study considered whales to be a positive influence to the productivity of ocean fisheries  in what has been termed a  whale pump   whales carry nutrients such as nitrogen from the depths back to the surface  this functions as an upward biological pump  reversing an earlier presumption that whales accelerate the loss of nutrients to the bottom  this nitrogen input in the gulf of maine is more than the input of all rivers combined emptying into the gulf  some 25,000  short tons (23,000  t  each whales defecate at the ocean s surface  their excrement is important for fisheries because it is rich in iron and nitrogen  the whale feces are liquid and instead of sinking  they stay at the surface where phytoplankton feed off death  whale carcasses fall to the deep ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life  evidence of whale falls in present-day  and fossil records shows that deep sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures  with a global diversity of 407  species  comparable to other neritic biodiversity hotspots  such as cold seeps and hydrothermal deterioration of whale carcasses happens though a series of three stages  initially  moving organisms  such as sharks and hagfish  scavenge soft tissue at a rapid rate over a period of months to as long as two years  this is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments  which contain organic matter  by enrichment opportunists  such as crustaceans and polychaetes  throughout a period of years  finally  sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulphide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms  which in turn  support other organisms such as mussels  clams  limpets  and sea snails  this stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species  averaging 185  species per mammals were hunted by coastal aboriginal humans historically for food and other resources  these subsistence hunts still occur in canada  greenland  indonesia  russia  the united states  and several nations in the caribbean  the effects of these are only localized  as hunting efforts were on a relatively small commercial hunting took this to a much greater scale and marine mammals were heavily exploited  this led to the extinction of the †steller s sea cow  along with subsistence hunting  and the †caribbean monk today  populations of species that were historically hunted  such as blue whales  balaenoptera musculus  and the north pacific right whale  eubalaena japonica   are much lower than their pre-whaling  because whales generally have slow growth rates  are slow to reach sexual maturity  and have a low reproductive output  population recovery has been very number of whales are still subject to direct hunting  despite the 1986  moratorium ban on whaling set under the terms of the international whaling commission  iwc   there are only two nations remaining which sanction commercial whaling  norway  where several hundred common minke whales are harvested each year  and iceland  where quotas of 150  fin whales and 100  minke whales per year are japan also harvests several hundred antarctic and north pacific minke whales each year  ostensibly for scientific research in accordance with the however  the illegal trade of whale and dolphin meat is a significant market in japan and some most profitable furs in the fur trade were those of sea otters  especially the northern sea otter which inhabited the coastal waters between the columbia river to the south and cook inlet to the north  the fur of the californian southern sea otter was less highly prized and thus less profitable  after the northern sea otter was hunted to local extinction  maritime fur traders shifted to california until the southern sea otter was likewise nearly the british and american maritime fur traders took their furs to the chinese port of guangzhou  canton   where they worked within the established canton system  furs from russian america were mostly sold to china via the mongolian trading town of kyakhta  which had been opened to russian trade by the 1727  treaty of sealing was historically just as important as the whaling industry  exploited species included harp seals  hooded seals  caspian seals  elephant seals  walruses and all species of fur the scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the after the canadian government reduced the length of the hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers  for example  antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting  the northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th  century  with only a small population remaining on guadalupe island  it has since recolonized much of its historic range  but has a population conversely  the mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range  which stretched from the mediterranean to the black sea and northwest africa  and only remains in the northeastern mediterranean and some parts of northwest bears can be hunted for sport in canada with a special permit and accompaniment by a local guide  this can be an important source of income for small communities  as guided hunts bring in more income than selling the polar bear hide on markets  the united states  russia  norway  greenland  and canada allow subsistence hunting  and canada distributes hunting permits to indigenous communities  the selling of these permits is a main source of income for many of these communities  their hides can be used for subsistence purposes  kept as hunting trophies  or can be bought in is the incidental capture of non-target  species in fisheries  fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds  however  entanglements in long lines  mid-water  trawls  and both trap and pot lines are also tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by by-catch  affects all cetaceans  both small and big  in all habitat types  however  smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds are most vulnerable as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently while larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them  the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets  however  these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact strikes cause death for a number of marine mammals  especially in particular  fast commercial vessels such as container ships can cause major injuries or death when they collide with marine mammals  collisions occur both with large commercial vessels and recreational boats and cause injury to whales or smaller cetaceans  the critically endangered north atlantic right whale is particularly affected by vessel tourism boats designed for whale and dolphin watching can also negatively impact on marine mammals by interfering with their natural fishery industry not only threatens marine mammals through by-catch,  but also through competition for food  large scale fisheries have led to the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals  pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary starvation of young  and reduced recruitment into the as the fish stocks have been depleted  the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict  large-scale  culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated in a number of areas in order to protect fish stocks for human aquaculture takes up space so in effect creates competition for space  however  there is little direct competition for aquaculture shellfish on the other hand  marine mammals regularly take finfish from farms  which creates significant problems for marine farmers  while there are usually legal mechanisms designed to deter marine mammals  such as anti-predator  nets or harassment devices  individuals are often illegally degradation is caused by a number of human activities  marine mammals that live in coastal environments are most likely to be affected by habitat degradation and loss  developments such as sewage marine outfalls  moorings  dredging  blasting  dumping  port construction  hydroelectric projects  and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable for example  extensive shellfish aquaculture takes up valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding  foraging and that are discharged into the marine environment accumulate in the bodies of marine mammals when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with contaminants that are found in the tissues of marine mammals include heavy metals  such as mercury and lead  but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic for example  these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine impair the reproductive system  and lower the immune system of individuals  leading to a higher number of other pollutants such as oil  plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of marine pollution from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals  this is a problem because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate  and locate both predators and underwater explosions are used for a variety of purposes including military activities  construction and oceanographic or geophysical research  they can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs  and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal underwater noise is generated from shipping  the oil and gas industry  research  and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation  acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater changes to the global atmosphere due to anthropogenic activity threaten marine mammals  the first is increases in ultraviolet radiation due to ozone depletion  and this mainly affects the antarctic and other areas of the southern an increase in ultraviolet radiation has the capacity to decrease phytoplankton abundance  which forms the basis of the food chain in the the second effect of global climate change is global warming due to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere  raised sea levels  sea temperature and changed currents are expected to affect marine mammals by altering the distribution of important prey species  and changing the suitability of breeding sites and migratory the arctic food chain would be disrupted by the near extinction or migration of polar bears  arctic sea ice is the polar bear s habitat  it has been declining at a rate of 13%  per decade because the temperature is rising at twice the rate of the rest of the by the year 2050,  up to two-thirds  of the world s polar bears may vanish if the sea ice continues to melt at its current marine mammal protection act of 1972   mmpa  was passed on october 21,  1972  under president richard to prevent the further depletion and possible extinction of marine mammal it prohibits the taking   the act of hunting  killing  capture  and or harassment of any marine mammal  or  the attempt at such   of any

direct-action  tactics to expose illegal thousands of years  indigenous peoples of the arctic have depended on whale meat  the meat is harvested from legal  non-commercial  hunts that occur twice a year in the spring and autumn  the meat is stored and eaten throughout the the skin and blubber  muktuk  taken from the bowhead  beluga  or narwhal is also valued  and is eaten raw or cooked  whaling has also been practiced in the faroe islands in the north atlantic since about the time of the first norse settlements on the islands  around 1000  long-finned  pilot whales are still killed annually  mainly during the today  dolphin meat is consumed in a small number of countries worldwide  which include and peru  where it is referred to as chancho marino  or  sea in some parts of the world  such as taiji  japan and the faroe islands  dolphins are traditionally considered food  and are killed in harpoon or drive have been human health concerns associated with the consumption of dolphin meat in japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of there are no known cases of mercury poisoning as a result of consuming dolphin meat  though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high  the japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular similar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the faroe islands  where prenatal exposure to methylmercury and pcbs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst faroe islands population was exposed to methylmercury largely from contaminated pilot whale meat  which contained very high levels of about 2  mg methylmercury kg  however  the faroe islands populations also eat significant amounts of fish  the study of about 900  faroese children showed that prenatal exposure to methylmercury resulted in neuropsychological deficits at 7  years of ageringed seals were once the main food staple for the inuit  they are still an important food source for the people of and are also hunted and eaten in alaska  seal meat is an important source of food for residents of small coastal the seal blubber is used to make seal oil  which is marketed as a fish oil supplement  in 2001,  two percent of canada s raw seal oil was processed and sold in canadian health species of dolphins are kept in captivity  these small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks and dolphinariums  such as seaworld  bottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train and have a long lifespan in captivity  hundreds of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world  though exact numbers are hard to the dolphin  smile  makes them popular attractions  as this is a welcoming facial expression in humans  however the smile is due to a lack of facial muscles and subsequent lack of facial such as world animal protection and the whale and dolphin conservation society campaign against the practice of keeping cetaceans  particularly killer whales  in captivity  in captivity  they often develop pathologies  such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90%  of male killer whales  captives have vastly reduced life expectancies  on average only living into their 20s.  in the wild  females who survive infancy live 46  years on average  and up to 70–80  years in rare cases  wild males who survive infancy live 31  years on average  and up to 50–60  captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat  and captive whales  social groups are foreign to those found in the wild  captive life is also stressful due the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior  as well as restricting pool size  wild killer whales may travel up to 100  miles (160  km  in a day  and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves  their tankmates  or humans  which critics say is a result of dolphins are often trained to do several anthropomorphic behaviors  including waving and kissing—behaviors wild dolphins would rarely large size and playfulness of pinnipeds make them popular attractions  some exhibits have rocky backgrounds with artificial haul-out  sites and a pool  while others have pens with small rocky  elevated shelters where the animals can dive into their pools  more elaborate exhibits contain deep pools that can be viewed underwater with rock-mimicking  cement as haul-out  areas  the most common pinniped species kept in captivity is the california sea lion as it is abundant and easy to these animals are used to perform tricks and entertain other species popularly kept in captivity include the grey seal and harbor seal  larger animals like walruses and steller sea lions are much less pinnipeds are popular attractions because they are  disneyfied   and  consequently  people often anthropomorphize them with a curious  funny  or playful organizations  such as the humane society of the united states and world animal protection  object to keeping pinnipeds and other marine mammals in captivity  they state that the exhibits could not be large enough to house animals that have evolved to be migratory  and a pool could never replace the size and biodiversity of the ocean  they also oppose using sea lions for entertainment  claiming the tricks performed are  exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors  and distract the audience from the animal s unnatural otters can do well in captivity  and are featured in over 40  public aquariums and the seattle aquarium became the first institution to raise sea otters from conception to adulthood with the birth of tichuk in 1979,  followed by three more pups in the early in 2007,  a youtube video of two cute sea otters holding paws drew 1.5  million viewers in two weeks  and had over 20  million views as of january filmed five years previously at the vancouver aquarium  it was youtube s most popular animal video at the time  although it has since been otters are often viewed as having a  happy family life   but this is an oldest manatee in captivity was at the south florida museum s parker manatee aquarium in bradenton  florida  born at the miami aquarium and tackle company on july 21,  1948,  snooty was one of the first recorded captive manatee births  he was raised entirely in and died at the age of manatees can also be viewed in a number of european zoos  such as the tierpark in the nuremberg in zooparc de beauval in and in the aquarium of genoa in the river safari at singapore features seven of dolphins and california sea lions were used in the united states navy marine mammal program  nmmp  to detect mines  protect ships from enemy soldiers  and recover objects  the navy has never trained attack dolphins  as they would not be able to discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers  there were five marine mammal teams  each purposed for one of the three tasks  mk4   dolphins   mk5   sea lions   mk6   dolphins and sea lions   mk7   dolphins   and mk8   dolphins   mk is short for mark  the dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column  because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines  the sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives  mk6  protects harbors and ships from enemy divers  and was operational in the gulf war and vietnam war  the dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank  so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby navy personnel  sea lions would hand-cuff  the enemy  and try to outmaneuver their use of marine mammals by the navy  even in accordance with the navy s policy  continues to meet opposition  the navy s policy says that only positive reinforcement is to be used while training the military dolphins  and that they be cared for in accordance with accepted standards in animal care  the inevitable stresses involved in training are topics of controversy  as their treatment is unlike the animals  natural lifestyle  especially towards their confined spaces when not training  there is also controversy over the use of muzzles and other inhibitors  which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working  the navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects  but conservation activists say this is done to reinforce the trainers  control over the dolphins  who hand out food rewards  the means of transportation is also an issue for conservation activists  since they are hauled in dry carriers  and switching tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are
