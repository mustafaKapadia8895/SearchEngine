 2015  pacific hurricane season -  wikipediathe 2015  pacific hurricane season is the second-most  active pacific hurricane season on record  with 26  named storms  only behind the 1992  season  a record-tying  16  of the storms became hurricanes  and a record 11  storms became major hurricanes throughout the season  the central pacific  the portion of the eastern pacific between the international dateline and 140°w,  had its most active year on record  with fifteen tropical cyclones forming in or entering the moreover  the season was the second most active season in terms of accumulated cyclone energy  with a total of 286  ace units  the season officially started on may 15  in the east pacific ocean and on june 1  in the central pacific  they both ended on november 30.  these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the pacific however  the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year  this was shown when a tropical depression existed on december 31.  the above-average  activity during the season was attributed in part to the strong 2014–16  el niño event the season featured several long-tracking  and powerful storms  although land impact was often minimal  in june  hurricane blanca  an early season category 4  hurricane  killed four people due to rough seas  hurricane carlos caused minor damage while passing a short distance off the coast of mexico  on august 29,  three category 4  hurricanes  kilo  ignacio  jimena  were all active simultaneously for the first time in recorded history  moisture from hurricane linda contributed to storms that killed 21  people in utah  later in september  hurricane marty was responsible for $30  million (2015  usd  in damages to the southwestern mexican coast  in october  hurricane patricia became the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the western hemisphere  with a central pressure of 872  mbar  hpa  25.75  inhg  and 1-minute  sustained winds of 215  mph (345  km h   after also becoming the strongest landfalling pacific hurricane on record  patricia claimed 13  lives and was responsible for $460  million in damages  the season s activity continued into november  when hurricane sandra became the strongest hurricane ever recorded in that month on april 10,  2015,  the servicio meteorológico nacional  smn  issued its first outlook for the pacific hurricane season  forecasting 19  named storms  11  hurricanes  and 4  major hurricanes  the organization listed a set of seasons with similar atmospheric and oceanic conditions  including 1982,  1986,  1991,  1994,  2002,  and on may 27,  the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s climate prediction center  cpc  released its forecast for the year  highlighting a 70%  chance of an above-average  season with 15–22  named storms  7–12  hurricanes  5–8  major hurricanes  and an accumulated cyclone energy  ace  index range of 110–190%  of the median  while both organizations cited an intensifying el niño as a cause of increased activity  the cpc also highlighted the difference in global sea surface temperature patterns in 2015  versus the 1995–2014  the season ended up exceeding all of these forecasts with 26  named storms  16  hurricanes  11  major hurricanes  and an ace index at more than 200%  of the median the accumulated cyclone energy  ace  index for the season was 160.4825  units in the east pacific and 126.03  units in the central pacific  the total ace for the northeast pacific basin in 2015  amounted to 286.5125  1]the  season s first named storm  andres  developed two weeks after the official start of the season  andres later reached peak intensity as a category 4  hurricane on june on june 3,  blanca became both earliest second hurricane and second major hurricane in the basin since reliable records this broke the previous record by seven days set by hurricane cristina the previous on june 13,  hurricane carlos became the second earliest third hurricane on after an inactive period for about a month  activity resumed in mid-july  with five systems forming in short succession  three in the central pacific and two in the east pacific   one of these systems  tropical storm ela  became the third earliest forming central pacific storm on record at the time  tropical storm halola crossed the international date line two days later  next month  hurricanes guillermo and hilda both affected hawaii  while hurricane loke became the record breaking fifth named storm in the central pacific  soon after loke dissipated  tropical storm kilo  which formed before loke  strengthened into a hurricane while ignacio and jimena were being named  late on august 29th,  all three storms exploded into category 4  major needed  these three major hurricanes were all active on august 29,  being the first time in the historical record that three or more major hurricanes existed simultaneously in the pacific  east of the international date line storm kevin formed  but was short-lived,  and kevin and ignacio dissipated on september 5.  hurricane linda formed on september 6  and peaked as a category 3  major hurricane  yet dissipated four days later  after jimena and linda dissipated on september 10,  a short 9  day pause of tropical activity occurred  the first since june  then  on september 19,  malia developed  with sixteen-e  developing the day after  sixteen-e  quickly moved over baja california and mainland mexico before dissipating on september 21.  malia dissipated on september 22,  but was followed three days later by tropical depression six-c,  which intensified into tropical storm niala southeast of hawaii  prompting a tropical storm watch for hawaii county  the  big island  or  hawai i   marty developed  became a hurricane just off mexico  yet dissipated out to needed  with the formation of oho on october 3,  the 2015  season surpassed 1992  and 1994  as the most active year on record in the central on october 18  olaf strengthened to a hurricane at 9.4°n  making it the southernmost-forming  hurricane in the east pacific basin  then it strengthened to a major hurricane at 9.9°n,  making it the southernmost-forming  major hurricane in the in comparison  the southernmost-forming  tropical cyclone in the basin is adolph of 1983  which became a tropical depression at patricia rapidly intensified into a category 4  hurricane on october 22,  the season became only the second – after 1992  – in the east pacific satellite era to see the formation of a record ten major hurricanes  not only did patricia tie the record for the 2015  east pacific hurricane season with needed  it became the strongest hurricane in the basin with a pressure of 892  millibars  breaking the previous record of 902  millibars  set by 1997's  hurricane patricia subsequently became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the western hemisphere in terms of barometric pressure  it had a central pressure of 872  millibars  the lowest ever observed by the national hurricane center which has jurisdiction in the east pacific and atlantic  and the second-lowest  pressure globally  behind typhoon tip of 1979  which had a central pressure of 870  additionally  its maximum sustained winds of 215  mph (345  km h  were the strongest ever reliably recorded or estimated anywhere olaf dissipated on october 27,  there was no further tropical activity until tropical storm rick formed in mid-november.  with the formation of tropical storm sandra  two named storms developed within the month of november  which tied the record with 2006  for being the most active november since pacific hurricane records needed  two days later  sandra strengthened into a major hurricane  bringing the season total to a record eleven  its peak winds of 150  mph (240  km h  surpassed hurricane kenneth of 2011  for the strongest november pacific hurricane in terms of sustained winds  while its minimum central pressure of 934  millibars also surpassed kenneth for the most intense november pacific hurricane in terms of central sandra s dissipation marked the last tropical storm to exist inside of the hurricane season  despite this  over a month later  favorable conditions inside the central pacific lead to the formation of tropical depression nine-c  on december 31.  the depression never reached tropical storm strength  leaving the season one named storm shy of tying the 1992  season s record of 27  named storms  it dissipated that same day  marking the latest ending to a pacific hurricane season on needed on may 23,  the national hurricane center began monitoring the potential for tropical cyclogenesis well south of mexico over the following a large area of disturbed weather formed two days steadily organizing to become tropical depression one-e  at 09:00  utc on may with an increase in spiral banding and an expanding central dense overcast  the depression was upgraded to tropical storm andres six hours directed west-northwest  and eventually northwest by a ridge over mexico  the cyclone steadily organized despite moderate northerly shear  at 21:00  utc on may 29,  andres intensified into a category 1  and by 15:00  utc on may 30,  the cyclone further strengthened into a category 2  although forecasts did not indicate additional strengthening  andres began a period of rapid deepening the following day  becoming one of only five major hurricanes during the month of may at 21:00  utc and further intensifying into a category 4  at 03:00  utc on june andres ultimately reached its peak intensity early on june 1  with winds of 145  mph (230  thereafter  the system moved over cooler waters and into a more stable environment which imparted over the next few days  andres continued to weaken  and by june 3,  the nhc determined that it had weakened into a tropical further weakening ensured  with andres being designated as a remnant low on june extending from the remnants of andres brought light rain to parts of the southwest united states  with phoenix  arizona having measurable precipitation on june 5  for the first time since records began in this moisture further extended into colorado  resulting in scattered severe tropical wave first monitored by the nhc late on may 27  spawned a weak area of low pressure well south of acapulco  mexico two days plagued by strong upper-level  winds from hurricane andres  the disturbance slowly organized into the season s second tropical depression at 22:30  utc on may 31  and further into tropical storm blanca the following moving little within a weak steering regime  the cyclone began rapid deepening by june 2  under favorable conditions aloft  at 21:00  utc  it was upgraded to a category 1  following the appearance of a pinhole blanca was upgraded to a category 4  hurricane at 12:00  utc on june 3.  shortly thereafter  blanca reached its peak intensity with winds of 145  mph (230  tremendous upwelling of cooler waters  with some areas falling from 30  to 21  °c (86  to 70  resulted in weakening early on june its eye quickly collapsed and convection diminished as it underwent an eyewall replacement reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm on june 5  and found blanca to have degraded to category 1  the next day  blanca rapidly reintensified and reached its secondary peak as a category 4  with winds of 130  mph (215  thereafter  cooler waters and southeasterly wind shear prompted a weakening phase once after weakening to a tropical storm on june blanca made landfall around 12:00  utc on june 8,  near puerto cortés with winds of 45  mph (75  km h  and became the earliest instance of a landfall in the baja california peninsula since records began in thereafter  blanca weakened to a tropical depression before degenerating into a remnant low early on june 9  as convection june 3,  precautionary alerts were raised across the southern baja california peninsula and much of western mexico  due to potential impacts from the a collective 3,300  troops from the mexican army and navy were deployed to baja california sur to ensure the safety of although blanca remained far from jalisco  large swells and rip currents produced by the hurricane claimed four across baja california sur  high winds downed power lines and left 104,106  residents without electricity  however  around 90  percent of the outages were fixed within 12  hours of the the remnants of blanca later brought much-needed  rain to parts of southern california  daily rainfall records were broken in several areas  though accumulations were generally less than 1  in (25  some flooding took place in santa barbara damage across the state amounted to additionally  on june 10,  some of blanca s moisture moved north and brought light showers to the san francisco bay early june  a kelvin wave interacted with a few tropical waves to the south of mexico  the system gradually organized and was designated as a tropical depression on june 10,  while situated about 290  mi (470  km  south-southeast  of puerto escondido  oaxaca  drifting slowly northwestward  the depression was upgraded further to tropical storm intensity  although persistent wind shear and dry air hampered intensification early on  carlos strengthened into a hurricane on june 13  after moving into more favorable conditions  however  the return of dry air and upwelling caused the storm to deteriorate into a tropical storm  paralleling the mexican coast  carlos regained hurricane intensity on june 15  and peaked with sustained winds of 90  mph (150  km h  the next day  wind shear and dry air afterwards led to rapid weakening  falling to tropical storm intensity on june 17  and degeneration into a remnant area of low pressure hours formation prompted coastal authorities to enact precautionary measures along states deemed at risk  in guerrero  507  shelters were the nhc also issued several tropical cyclone warnings and watches between june 11  and june 17  from jalisco to guerrero  rough seas along the shore generated by the hurricane caused widespread which included the sinking of 12  ships in playa manzanillo the waves combined with heavy rain to inflict at least 5  million pesos (us$320,000)  of damage on michoacán s coastal strong winds produced by the passing storm also downed trees  power poles  and billboards  especially in there  16  homes were swept away by the tropical wave crossing the eastern pacific spawned an area of low pressure on july the system gradually organized amid persistent wind shear and on july 8,  the system intensified into tropical depression four-e  just before it entered the area of responsibility of the central pacific hurricane center on july 9,  the depression intensified into a tropical storm as it tracked to the northwest  and was named ela by the ela intensified slightly to reach its peak intensity with 45  mph (75  km h   however  strong wind shear prevented ela from intensifying further by removing thunderstorms from the circulation center  in fact causing it to gradually eventually  ela was downgraded into a depression on july 8,  before being declared a remnant low well east of the hawaiian is one of just six tropical cyclones to form as a depression in the east pacific basin but not be named until entering the central pacific  the others are lala  li  iniki and lana  it would be succeeded by hurricane ulika a year later  it is also the fourth earliest storm to form during the calendar year in the central pacific after ekeka and hali of as well as pali of tropical disturbance well to the southwest of hawaii organized into tropical depression one-c  by july early the next day  the system developed into tropical storm halola  on july 12,  halola crossed the international date line and entered the western pacific basin  the area of responsibility of the japan meteorological july 10,  a tropical disturbance organized and became tropical depression two-c.  due to an increase of convection near its centre  the cphc upgraded the system to tropical storm iune by the next day  but because of its small size and the upper level winds  iune s circulation became exposed and had weakened to a tropical depression on july needed  by july 13,  iune degenerated to a remnant low as its remnant circulation moved in a slow westward westward-moving  tropical wave crossed central america and entered the eastern pacific  on july 11,  the system was declared tropical depression five-e.  despite moderate northwesterly wind shear  the depression quickly strengthened into tropical storm dolores and reached hurricane status early on july 13.  a day later  when the shear diminished  dolores rapidly intensified into a category 4  hurricane with winds 130  mph (215  km h  and a minimum pressure of 946  mbar  hpa  27.94  inhg   however  as dolores approached socorro island  the cyclone underwent an eyewall replacement cycle and began to steadily weaken  by the morning of july 17,  dolores had deteriorated to a tropical storm  and eventually degenerated into a post-tropical  remnant low about 300  miles west of the baja california coast the next day  the remnant low slowly curved southwards and dissipated on 22  july west of san diego  extending from the storm s remnants brought record rains and thunderstorms to southern california  record monthly rainfall totals include 2  in (51  mm  in san diego  1.30  in (33  mm  in los angeles  and 1.16  in (29  mm  in paso robles  in the foothills and mountains of east san diego county  e g  the town of ramona   rainfall exceeded 4  in (100  this had the effect of helping firefighters contain the north but also resulted in debris flows and rock slides that damaged about 90  homes and submerged and washed out a bridge along interstate the san diego river reached levels of 8.9  ft (2.7  m —just below flood stage—and overflowed its banks in a few flash flooding in riverside county washed out a portion of interstate 10  and a bridge  losses reached $50  tropical wave about 1,000  mi (1,610  km  southwest of the tip of the baja california peninsula spawned a broad area of low pressure on july 10.  the low s circulation became increasingly well defined as the tropical wave moved away from the system  leading to the classification of tropical depression six-e  at 12:00  utc on july gradually organizing as it began to move west-northwestwards,  the depression intensified to become tropical storm enrique eighteen hours despite being situated in a generally favorable environment  dry air to the northwest of enrique entrained into its circulation  thus enrique struggled to intensify  eventually  the system reached its peak intensity with 50  mph (85  km h  winds and a minimum pressure of 1000  mbar  hpa  29.53  inhg  late on july thereafter  cooling sea surface temperatures and increasing southwesterly vertical wind shear took their toll on the cyclone  and enrique started to weakened on july 15.  enrique continued to maintain its intensity over the next two days as it began to slow down and turn to the southwest under the influence of hurricane dolores to its however  during the afternoon of july 17,  enrique weakened to a tropical and further to a remnant low the next day  the remnants re-curved  eastward over the next two throughout its lifetime  enrique never affected westward-tracking  tropical wave moved off africa on july 7,  crossing into the east pacific nine days later  the disturbance was initially disorganized  with a broad area of low pressure and intermittent convection  by 06:00  utc on july 23,  however  it acquired sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression about 430  mi (690  km  southwest of the southern tip of baja six hours later  the depression intensified into tropical storm felicia and attained peak winds of 40  mph (65  the negative effects of shear  dry air  and cooler waters began to affect felicia almost immediately  and the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00  utc on july all associated convection with the storm dissipated  marking felicia s degeneration into a remnant low by 18:00  utc that day  the low turned west and southwest prior to opening into a trough on july low pressure area formed in the middle of the eastern pacific  moving northwest  the low slowly intensified into tropical depression eight-e  on july 27.  however  strong north-northwesterly  wind shear prevented it from intensifying into a tropical storm  as eight-e  moved into a drier environment  it failed to sustain deep convection near its center  and eventually degenerated into a remnant low early on july 30.  eight-e's  remnants continued tracking in a westward direction and later crossed the international dateline on august tropical disturbance gained enough organization to be declared tropical depression nine-e  on july 29.  located in an environment of low wind shear  high sea surface temperatures and abundant moisture  conditions were very favorable for strengthening  allowing nine-e  to intensify into tropical storm guillermo just 6  hours later  continuing to quickly intensify  guillermo became a hurricane only 36  hours after its formation  and eventually reached peak intensity with winds of 110  mph (175  km h —a strong category 2  hurricane  soon after  though  guillermo weakened slightly  but remained at category 2  strength as it crossed 140°w  into the central however  as it neared hawaii  northeasterly wind shear began to weaken which eventually degraded to a tropical despite restrengthening slightly on august guillermo soon resumed weakening and eventually degenerated into a post-tropical  cyclone on august august 6,  some of guillermo s moisture traveled to northern california and the san francisco bay area to bring rare dry lightning storms to those areas during the tropical wave behind guillermo gained enough organization to be declared tropical depression ten-e.  on august 6,  the storm intensified into tropical storm hilda  amid moderate northeasterly wind shear and warm waters  hilda gradually strengthened into a hurricane early on august 7.  rapid intensification ensued thereafter as the shear diminished  and hilda became a category 3  major hurricane just before entering the central continuing to rapidly intensify  hilda eventually reached its peak intensity as a category 4  hurricane with 145  mph (230  km h  sustained winds and a minimum pressure of 937  mbar however  southwesterly shear from a nearby tropical upper tropospheric trough and the subtropical jet stream began to erode the system  and hilda weakened back below major hurricane status on august continuing to gradually weaken while approaching hawaii  hilda degraded to a tropical storm two days and finally to a tropical depression on august hilda degenerated into a post-tropical  cyclone late the same and dissipated early on august 14.hilda  brought locally heavy rains to the big island  though there were no reports of broad area of low pressure around 485  miles (780  km  south-southwest  of cabo san lucas organized into tropical depression eleven-e  on august 16.  moving on a northwesterly to west-northwesterly  path  the cyclone failed to intensify and entered an area of unfavorable conditions late on august 17.  southeasterly shear  dry air entrainment and cooler waters caused the depression to lose its deep convection  eventually degenerating into a remnant low by august 18.  the low turned to the north-northwest  and dissipated 2  days later around 980  miles (1570  km  west of punta august 20,  a low pressure area south of hawaii became tropical depression three-c.  the storm quickly strengthened into tropical storm kilo and continued strengthening  the storm became a strong tropical storm  and despite being in a favorable environment  kilo weakened into a tropical depression on august needed  the storm would remain at tropical depression strength for the next three despite its instability  kilo s large-scale  circulation brought enhanced moisture into hawaii  leading to locally heavy rainfall in that state  after nearby hurricane loke moved north and dissipated on august 26,  kilo was able to restrengthen into a tropical storm  intensification resumed the next day  with kilo reaching hurricane strength  by august 29,  kilo had rapidly intensified into a major hurricane  as the storm neared the international date line  kilo peaked in intensity on august 30  as a category 4  hurricane with winds of 140  miles per hour and a minimum central pressure of 940  needed  kilo was also one of three simultaneous major hurricanes east of the international date line along with ignacio and jimena  the first such occurrence in recorded after peaking in strength  kilo fluctuated between category 3  and 4  strength as it slowly moved northwest  before slowly weakening below major hurricane status as conditions became less needed  it crossed the dateline early on september 1,  becoming typhoon kilo continued on to become one of the longest lived tropical cyclones on record  with a total lifespan of 22  days  just over 3  tropical disturbance near the international dateline developed into tropical depression four-c  on august 21.  moving in an erratic northerly motion  the depression intensified into tropical storm loke  loke was upgraded to a minimal hurricane as it passed over the papahānaumokuākea marine national monument  soon after  loke began accelerated north-northwestward  as it neared the international date line  loke became extratropical late on august 26  as it crossed the basin  the storm was absorbed by typhoon atsani the day needed on august 25,  a low-pressure  system formed and organized into tropical depression twelve-e,  before strengthening into tropical storm ignacio initially moved west-northwest,  posing a threat to hawaii  on august 26,  ignacio became a category 1  hurricane  while continuing its trek towards hawaii  over the next few days  ignacio struggled to intensify while being impacted by moderate wind as wind shear relaxed  ignacio was able to quickly intensify to major hurricane status on august 29,  attaining winds of 115  miles per hour  at this time  the big island of hawaii was placed under a tropical storm watch  as the island began feeling the effects of high ignacio continued to rapidly intensify  attaining peak intensity at category 4  status with winds of 145  miles per hour and a minimum central pressure of 942  millibars on august ignacio was also one of three simultaneous category 4  hurricanes east of the international dateline along with kilo and jimena  the first such occurrence in recorded peaking in intensity  ignacio began weakening after moving into a less favorable environment  while weakening  ignacio passed to the north of the hawaii island chain  causing only minimal impacts  the storm weakened to tropical storm strength on september 1,  but was able to reattain hurricane status  this would repeat once again  before the storm weakened to a tropical storm for the last time  and became post-tropical  six hours the remnants of ignacio continued north across the pacific  before turning to the northeast towards western canada  on september 8,  the extratropical remnants of ignacio moved onshore in british columbia  bringing only light rain and few westward-moving  low pressure area organized into a tropical depression on august 26,  around 640  mi (1030  km  southwest of manzanillo  the next day  the depression developed a tight inner core with sustained gale-force  winds  accordingly  it was named jimena by the moving over very warm waters near 30  °c (86  °f  and located in an environment of low wind shear and abundant moisture  jimena underwent a period of rapid deepening over the next 48  the nhc upgraded jimena to a hurricane merely 30  hours after being and further to a major hurricane 18  hours early on august 29,  jimena reached its peak intensity with winds of 155  mph (250  km h —just below category 5  status on the saffir-simpson  hurricane wind scale—and a minimum barometric pressure of 932  mbar  hpa  27.52  soon after  jimena turned to the west-northwest  and underwent an eyewall replacement despite weakening slightly  jimena remained at category 4  status  thus becoming one of three simultaneous category 4  major hurricanes east of the international date line on august 30—the  first such occurrence of its on august 31,  jimena completed the eyewall replacement cycle and quickly regained 150  mph (240  km h  however  upwelling of cooler waters beneath the hurricane and entrainment of mid-level  dry air into the circulation  as well as a second eyewall replacement cycle  resulted in a steady the next day  jimena crossed 140°w  as a category 3  hurricane and entered the jurisdiction of the jimena continued to weaken slowly amid cooling sea surface temperatures and increasing northerly wind shear  eventually degrading below hurricane status on september curving to the northwest  bursts of convection maintained jimena as a tropical storm  in spite of westerly wind shear in excess of 20  knots causing the low-level  circulation center to be devoid of deep convection near its center  jimena eventually weakened to a tropical depression on september 9  as it turned west-southwestwards  towards the hawaiian succumbing to the strong shear  jimena degenerated into a remnant low and dissipated soon jimena never posed a threat to land  only bringing scattered heavy rains to tropical wave crossed central america on august 25.  although it initially only produced transient bursts of convection  slow organization of the feature led to the formation of a tropical depression by 18:00  utc on august 31  while located well south of baja california  steered northwest and the north-northwest,  the cyclone intensified into tropical storm kevin by 18:00  utc the next day while being plagued by moderate wind shear  after reaching peak winds of 60  mph (95  km h  on september 3,  a further increase in upper-level  winds caused the low-  and mid-level  circulations to become displaced  devoid of deep convection  kevin degenerated to a remnant low by 12:00  utc on september 5;  the remnant circulation drifted northwest and dissipated the following in september  a cluster of clouds began to organize into a tropical system  at 03:00  utc on september 6,  they organized enough to be called tropical depression fifteen-e.  twelve hours later  the depression organized enough to be classified as a tropical storm and was given the name linda  linda rapidly strengthened as it moved on a northwestward course and became a hurricane just twelve hours after becoming a tropical storm due to large amounts of deep convection forming around the center  linda then became a category 2  hurricane  after stalling at category 2  intensity  linda again rapidly intensified  this time to a category 3  major hurricane  less than a day after becoming a major hurricane  linda rapidly weakened due to increasing wind shear and decreasing water temperatures  becoming a remnant low less than a week after moisture pulled north from linda brought thunderstorms to portions of california  flooding and rock slides prompted numerous road closures  one person drowned in the san bernardino national forest  remnants moisture from linda with a weak cold front also caused record heavy rainfall in los angeles on september with 3  swift water rescues and roughly 2  inches of rain across the l a  to san jose state university  linda s remnants may have also contributed to the severity of the valley more than a week of inactivity  a tropical disturbance intensified into tropical depression five-c  east of the international dateline on september 19.  the depression moved north-northeast,  before it crossed hawaii and was upgraded to tropical storm malia on september 21.  however  malia weakened into a post-tropical  cyclone on the next day  shortly before being absorbed into a frontal tropical wave gained enough organization to be declared tropical depression sixteen-e  on september 20.  located in an environment of strong southerly shear  the depression failed to intensify into a tropical storm  the next day  the heavily sheared system made landfall on baja california  then on isla tiburon  and finally in sonora  mexico  it dissipated just hours later  with its remnants going on to affect parts of arizona and new heavy rains in baja california and sonora caused heavy flooding  preliminary damage estimates in el fuerte  sinaloa  reached 300  million pesos (us$17.7  the remnant low brought considerable moisture to the desert southwest  and later combined with other systems to produce flooding across the great plains and upper rainfall in roswell  new mexico  reached 3  in (76  mm   one person drowned along the rio grande in new flooding also took place near phoenix  september 20,  a tropical disturbance was identified southeast of hawaii  moving westward south of the subtropical the disturbance organized  a which led to the formation of tropical depression six-c  on september it was upgraded into tropical storm niala soon after  and the storm headed west-northwest  towards niala reached its peak intensity with winds of 65  mph  and a pressure of 992  at this point  tropical storm warnings were issued for the big island  as were high surf   marine advisories for the same throughout september 26,  forecasts called for a westwards turn  just barely missing the big island  the next day  however  it became evident that niala was turning more towards the southwest by being steered by the lower level winds  sparing hawaii from at this time  niala dropped to 50  mph winds  and subsequently degraded into a depression on the later that day  unfavorable conditions including high wind shear weakened the storm even more  and niala degenerated into a post-tropical  remnant low late at 0000  utc on september the remnant low continued westwards  dissipating early october tropical wave  the northern portion of which led to the formation of the atlantic s tropical depression nine  emerged off the western coast of africa on september 10.  steered steadily westward  the wave entered the east pacific where deep convection coalesced around a well-defined  center  this led to the formation of a tropical depression about 335  mi (540  km  southwest of acapulco  mexico by 18:00  utc on september 26.  the depression intensified into tropical storm marty six hours later as it drifted north  amid an environment conducive for strengthening  marty reached hurricane intensity at 12:00  utc on september 28  and attained peak winds of 80  mph (130  km h  shortly thereafter  wind shear abruptly increased following peak intensity  causing the cyclone to weaken quickly  it was downgraded to a tropical storm at 06:00  utc on september 29  and degenerated into a remnant low a day later  the low eventually dissipated south of the mexico coastline on october rains and flooding from the remnants of marty rendered 35,000  people homeless in sonora  flooding in guaymas damaged 800  homes and 400  vehicles  three people sustained an uncommon occurrence  a slow moving disturbance detached from a monsoon trough southeast of hawaii and became tropical depression seven-c  on october with a favorable environment  the storm became tropical storm oho quickly with this  oho became the record breaking twelfth storm this year to enter  or form in the central pacific  under southwesterly wind shear  oho slowly intensified while accelerating while tracking northeastward  oho became a category 2  on october 7,  attaining peak intensity of 110  mph and a pressure of 957  shortly after its peak  oho moved to an area with cooler ocean temperatures and increasing southwesterly wind shear  which caused the storm to weaken and to lose its tropcal the storm became extratropical on october 8  and briefly weakened to a gale low on early october however  due to strong baroclinicity  ex-oho  briefly re-attained  hurricane-force  winds before starting a stead on october 10,  oho s remnants moved into alaska as a moderate extratropical storm  where it weakened  until the system dissipated over western canada 6  hours september 30,  a tropical disturbance well east of the international dateline developed from a monsoon slowly organizing  the cphc started to issue advisories on it as a tropical depression and designated it as shortly after however  southerly wind shear inhibited the storm to intensify to a tropical storm and caused its convection to with the low-level  closed circulation being displaced to the south of the remnant convection  the cphc issued its final advisory on the next eight-c's  remnants slowly drifted west-northwestward  until late on october 6,  eight-c  crossed the basin and the japan meteorological agency started warning on westward moving disturbance became tropical depression eighteen-e  on october 9.  steadily moving westwards  the depression became tropical storm nora soon after  curving west-northwestwards,  nora continued to intensify and was forecast to attain hurricane strength  after crossing into the central pacific  nora peaked with winds of 70  mph and a pressure of 993  millibars  continuing northwestwards  nora encountering less favorable conditions and quickly weakened  dissipating on october originated from a broad low pressure area that formed late on october 10.  at first  it showed some signs of organization  but convection associated with the system soon diminished due to temporary unfavorable eventually the system reorganized  and by october 15,  it had gained enough organization to be designated as tropical depression despite very favorable conditions  the system did not organize at first  maintaining its intensity for two days  finally  the system s organization improved  and the nhc named the depression soon after  olaf began to rapidly intensify and became a hurricane on october 18,  with hints of an eye starting to appear within organized deep convection  located at just 9.3°n,  it broke the record for the lowest-latitude  hurricane formation in the eastern pacific basin since reliable records began in olaf s intensification rate increased  and the next day  olaf had become a major hurricane with a well-defined  pinhole eye  at 9.8°n,  it broke the record for the lowest-latitude  major hurricane formation in the eastern pacific basin as six hours later  olaf was upgraded to a category 4  hurricane  the eighth of the moving west-northwestwards,  olaf reached peak intensity with 150  mph (240  km h  winds and a pressure of 938  mbar  hpa  27.70  inhg   just as it crossed into the central pacific peak intensity for 12  hours  olaf weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle  falling down to a low-end  category 3  although the eye appeared on satellite again  cloud tops warmed  and olaf weakened below major hurricane status while getting recurved to the north by a passing trough  however  despite only partially favorable conditions cloud tops associated with olaf cooled again and olaf reached a secondary peak intensity of 120  mph (195  km h   decreasing sea surface temperatures and vertical wind shear finally began to weaken the storm for good  and although an eye could still be made out on satellite until october 25,  the convective structure of olaf began to degrade  following dissipation of the eye  olaf was downgraded to a tropical storm on october 25.  the trough had now begun to pull olaf to the east  and olaf then re-entered  the eastern pacific basin on october 26,  becoming the first storm on record to cross into the central pacific and turn back into the eastern pacific while still a tropical the last of olaf s deep convection continued to be sheared away  and olaf was downgraded to a remnant low later on the same day  although the system was still producing gale-force  winds  olaf s remnant low gradually weakened  before dissipating on october tropical storm ema in 1982  also crossed from the central pacific to the eastern pacific  olaf is notable for being only one of two tropical cyclones to ever re-enter  the eastern pacific after moving into the central pacific  the other being hurricane ulika tropical depression twenty-e  formed on october 20,  off the southwestern coast of mexico  it only slowly intensified at first  becoming tropical storm patricia later that day  it organized rapidly  beginning early on october 21,  and became a hurricane late that day  in an atmosphere highly conducive to rapid deepening  on october 22,  explosive intensification occurred  and in only 24  hours  patricia became a category 5  hurricane with 175  mph (280  km h  the intensification rate rivaled those of hurricane linda in 1997  and hurricane wilma in 2005.  patricia subsequently attained winds of 215  mph (345  km h  and a central pressure of 872  mbar  hpa  25.75  inhg   becoming the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the western hemisphere  surpassing both the previous central pressure record set by hurricane wilma and the previous 1-minute  sustained wind record set by hurricane allen  patricia weakened even more rapidly than it intensified  just 30  hours after peaking in intensity  it was downgraded to a remnant low at 16:00  cdt on october however  patricia s landfall in western mexico as a category 4  hurricane with winds of 150  mph (240  km h   was still sufficient to qualify as the strongest landfall by any pacific tropical wave moved off the western coast of africa on november 3,  entering the east pacific roughly two weeks later  the disturbance encountered a persistent area of convection in the itcz  eventually coalescing into a tropical depression by 12:00  utc on november 18  while located 715  mi (1,150  km  south-southeast  of the southern tip of baja california  plagued by moderate southeasterly wind shear  the depression slowly intensified into tropical storm rick and simultaneously attained peak winds of 40  mph (65  km h  by 12:00  utc on november 19.  the cyclone failed to intensify further as it tracked west-northwest  within a dry environment  weakening to a tropical depression by 06:00  utc on november 22  and further degenerating into a remnant low twelve hours later  the low tracked northwest and eventually southwest prior to dissipating early on november from a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of africa on november 6,  sandra was first classified as a tropical depression on november 23  well south of mexico  environmental conditions  including high sea surface temperatures and low wind shear  were highly conducive to intensification and the storm quickly organized  a small central dense overcast developed atop the storm and sandra reached hurricane status early on november 25  after the consolidation of an eye  the hurricane achieved its peak as a category 4  hurricane with winds of 150  mph (240  km h  and a pressure of 934  mbar  hpa  27.58  inhg  early on november 26.  this made sandra the strongest november hurricane on record in the northeastern pacific  surpassing hurricane kenneth in 2011.  thereafter  increasing shear degraded the hurricane s structure and weakening ensued  rapid weakening took place on november 27  and sandra s circulation became devoid of convection as it diminished to a tropical storm that evening  the cyclone degenerated into a remnant low soon thereafter and ultimately dissipated just off the coast of sinaloa  mexico  on november the precursor to sandra traversed central america  it produced unseasonably heavy rainfall that triggered flooding and landslides  four people died in various incidents related to the system  three in el salvador and one in initially expecting a landfalling storm  officials in northwestern mexico prepared equipment for power outages  closed schools  and evacuated 180  sandra s effects largely consisted of light to moderate rainfall  some traffic accidents and landslides resulted from this  though the overall impacts were the official end of the hurricane season about a month prior  the persistence of favorable environments in the central pacific lead to the development of a tropical disturbance on december moving slowly eastward  the disturbance stayed in an environment with ample ocean heat content  which led to the development and maintenance of the thunderstorms in this turning northwards  the system gained latitude and formed a low-level  closed circulation  which led the cphc to start advisories on tropical depression nine-c  at a very low latitude at 03:00  utc on december moving slowly westwards  nine-c  never reached tropical storm strength due to its proximity to the equator and being under 20-knot  vertical wind shear  leaving the 2015  season one storm shy of the record from as convection diminished due to an area of deep convection that had been in the vicinity of nine-c  moving away from it  the depression was unable to support itself and was downgraded into a remnant low at 00:00  utc on january 1,  2016,  marking the latest end to a pacific hurricane season on the remant low dissipated later that following names were used to name storms that formed in the northeastern pacific ocean during 2015.  the names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2021  this is the same list used in the 2009  season
