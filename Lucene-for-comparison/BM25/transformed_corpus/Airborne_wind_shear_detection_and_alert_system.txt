 airborne wind shear detection and alert system -  wikipediathe airborne wind shear detection and alert system  fitted in an aircraft  detects and alerts the pilot both visually and aurally of a wind shear condition  in case of reactive wind shear detection system  the detection takes place when the aircraft penetrates a wind shear condition of sufficient force  which can pose a hazard to the aircraft  in case of predictive wind shear detection system  the detection takes place  if such wind shear condition is ahead of the aircraft  in 1988  the u s  federal aviation administration  faa  mandated that all turbine-powered  commercial aircraft must have on-board  windshear detection systems by 1993.  airlines successfully lobbied to have commercial turbo-prop  aircraft exempted from this requirement in the predictive wind shear detection mode  the weather radar processor of the aircraft detects the presence of the microburst  a type of vertical wind shear condition by detecting the doppler frequency shift of the microwave pulses caused by the microburst ahead of the aircraft and displays the area where it is present in the navigation display unit  of the electronic flight instrument system  along with an aural warning on july 24,  1986,  the faa of united states and nasa signed a memorandum of agreement to formally begin the airborne wind-shear  detection and avoidance program  awdap   as a result  a wind-shear  program was created in the flight systems directorate of nasa s langley research center  after five years of intensely studying various weather phenomena and sensor technologies  the researchers decided to validate their findings in actual flight conditions  they chose an extensively modified boeing 737,  which was equipped with a rear research cockpit in place of the forward section of the passenger a modified rockwell collins model 708  x-band  ground-based  radar unit was used in the awdap experiments  the real-time  radar processor system used during 1992  flight experiments was a vme bus-based  system with a motorola 68030  host processor and three dsp boards on september 1,  1994,  the weather radar model rdr-4b  of the allied-signal/bendix   now honeywell  became the first predictive wind-shear  system to be certified for commercial airline operation  in the same year  continental airlines became the first commercial carrier to install an airborne predictive wind-shear  detection system on its aircraft  by june 1996,  rockwell collins and westinghouse s defense and electronics group  now grumman martin  also came up with faa-certified  predictive wind-shear  detection ieee intelligent transportation systems society is conducting researches for further developments of this system
