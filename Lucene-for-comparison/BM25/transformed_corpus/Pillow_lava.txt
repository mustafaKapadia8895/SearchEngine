 pillow lava -  wikipediapillow lavas are lavas that contain characteristic pillow-shaped  structures that are attributed to the extrusion of the lava under water  or subaqueous extrusion  pillow lavas in volcanic rock are characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped  masses  commonly up to one metre in diameter  they form the upper part of layer 2  of normal oceanic crust pillow lavas are commonly of basaltic composition  although pillows formed of komatiite  picrite  boninite  basaltic andesite  andesite  dacite or even rhyolite are in general the more intermediate  less rich in silica  the composition  the larger the pillows  due to the increase in viscosity of the erupting lava they occur wherever lava is extruded under water  such as along marine hotspot volcano chains and the constructive plate boundaries of mid-ocean  ridges  as new oceanic crust is formed  thick sequences of pillow lavas are erupted at the spreading center fed by dykes from the underlying magma chamber  pillow lavas and the related sheeted dyke complexes form part of a classic ophiolite sequence  when a segment of oceanic crust is thrust over the continental crust  thus exposing the oceanic segment above sea level  the presence of pillow lavas in the oldest preserved volcanic sequences on the planet  the isua and barberton greenstone belts  confirms the presence of large bodies of water on the earth s surface early in the archean eon  pillow lavas are used generally to confirm subaqueous volcanism in metamorphic belts pillow lavas are also found associated with some subglacial volcanoes at an early stage of an are created when magma reaches the surface but  as there is a large difference in temperature between the lava and the water  the surface of the emergent tongue cools very quickly  forming a skin  the tongue continues to lengthen and inflate with more lava  forming a lobe  until the pressure of the magma becomes sufficient to rupture the skin and start the formation of a new eruption point nearer the vent  this process produces a series of interconnecting lobate shapes that are pillow-like  in the skin cools much faster than the inside of the pillow  so it is very fine-grained,  with a glassy texture  the magma inside the pillow cools slowly  so is slightly coarser grained than the skin  but nevertheless it is still classified as fine grained pillow lavas can be used as a way-up  indicator in that is  study of their shape reveals the attitude  or position  in which they were originally formed  pillow lava shows it is still in its original orientation when
