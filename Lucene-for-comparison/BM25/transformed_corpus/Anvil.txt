 anvil -  wikipediaan anvil is a metalworking tool consisting of large block of metal  usually forged or cast steel   with a flattened top surface  upon which another object is struck  or  worked   anvils are as massive as they are practical  because the higher their inertia  the more efficiently they cause the energy of striking tools to be transferred to the work piece  on a quality anvil  the smith s hammer should rebound with almost as much energy as the smith puts into the downward stroke  ultimately making the smith s job easier and less physically strenuous  in most cases the anvil is used as a forging tool  before the advent of modern welding technology  it was a primary tool of metal great majority of modern anvils are made of cast or forged steel  the latter is stronger  that has been heat treated  inexpensive anvils have been made of cast iron and low quality steel  but are considered unsuitable for serious use as they deform and lack rebound when struck because anvils are very ancient tools and were at one time very commonplace  they have acquired symbolic meaning beyond their use as utilitarian objects  they have even found their way into popular culture including episodes of looney tunes  the name of a heavy metal band  and usage by artisanal blacksmiths as well as jewelers and metal smiths the primary work surface of the anvil is known as the face  it is generally made of hardened steel and should be flat and smooth with rounded edges for most work  any marks on the face will be transferred to the work  also  sharp edges tend to cut into the metal being worked and may cause cracks to form in the workpiece  the face is hardened and tempered to resist the blows of the smith s hammer  so the anvil face does not deform under repeated use  a hard anvil face also reduces the amount of force lost in each hammer needed   hammers  tools  and work pieces of hardened steel should never directly strike the anvil face with full force  as they may damage it  this can result in chipping or deforming of the anvil face the horn of the anvil is a conical projection used to form various round shapes and is generally unhardened steel or iron  the horn is used mostly in bending operations  it also is used by some smiths as an aid in  drawing down  stock  making it longer and thinner   some anvils  mainly european  are made with two horns  one square and one round  also  some anvils are made with side horns or clips for specialized work the step is that area of the anvil between the  horn  and the  face   it is soft and is used for cutting  its purpose is to prevent damaging the steel face of the anvil by conducting such operations there and so as not to damage the cutting edge of the chisel  though many smiths shun this practice as it will damage the anvil over time the hardie hole is a square hole into which specialized forming and cutting tools  called hardy tools  are placed  it is also used in punching and bending operations the pritchel hole is a small round hole that is present on most modern anvils  some anvils have more than one  it is used mostly for punching  at times  smiths will fit a second tool to this hole to allow the smith more flexibility when using more than one anvil tool an anvil needs to be placed upon a sturdy base made from an impact and fire resistant material  it requires being fastened firmly to the base  so it will not move when struck with a hammer  a loose anvil is extremely unsafe  as it can fall off the base and is an ineffective forging tool  common methods of attaching an anvil are spikes  chains  steel or iron straps  clips  bolts where there are holes provided  and cables  a smith would use whatever was at hand  as long as it held the anvil firmly in place  the anvil is placed as near to the forge as is convenient  generally no more than one step from the forge to prevent heat loss in the work piece the most common base traditionally was a hard wood log or large timber buried several feet into the floor of the forge shop floor  this was done to make the anvil immobile when heavy forging and bending were done upon the anvil  in the industrial era cast iron bases became available  they had the advantage of adding additional weight to the anvil  making it more stable while making the anvil movable  these bases are highly sought after by collectors today  when concrete became widely available  there was a trend to make steel reinforced anvil bases by some smiths  though this practice has largely been abandoned  in more modern times many anvils have been placed upon bases fabricated from steel  often a short thick section of a large i-beam.  in addition  bases have been made from dimensional lumber bolted together to form a large block or steel drums full of oil-saturated  sand to provide a damping effect  in recent times tripod bases of fabricated steel have become popular with some smiths there are many designs for anvils  which are often tailored for a specific purpose or to meet the needs of a particular smith  for example  there were anvils specifically made for farriers  general smiths  cutlers  chain makers  armorers  saw tuners  coach makers  coopers  and many other types of metal workers  such designs have originated in diverse geographic locations  the common blacksmith s anvil is made of either forged or cast steel  forged wrought iron with a hard steel face or cast iron with a hard steel face  cast iron anvils are not used for forging as they are incapable of standing up to the impact and will crack and dent  also  cast iron anvils without a hard steel face do not have the rebound that a harder anvil would and will tire out the smith  historically  some anvils have been made with a smooth top working face of hardened steel welded to a cast iron or wrought iron body  though this manufacturing method is no longer in use  at one end  the common smith s anvil has a projecting conical bick  beak  horn  used for hammering curved work pieces  the other end is typically called the heel  occasionally  the other end is also provided with a bick  partly rectangular in section  most anvils made since the late 18th  century also have a hardy hole and a pritchel hole where various tools  such as the anvil-cutter  or hot chisel  can be inserted and held by the anvil  some anvils have several hardy and pritchel holes  to accommodate a wider variety of hardy tools and pritchels  an anvil may also have a softer pad for chisel work an anvil for a power hammer is usually supported on a massive anvil block  sometimes weighing over 800  tons for a 12-ton  hammer  this again rests on a strong foundation of timber and masonry or concrete an anvil may have a marking indicating its weight  manufacturer  or place of origin  american-made  anvils were often marked in pounds  european anvils are sometimes marked in kilograms  english anvils were often marked in hundredweight  the marking consisting of three numbers  indicating hundredweight  quarter hundredweight and pounds  for example  a 3-1-5,  if such an anvil existed  would be 3x112  lb   1x28  lb   5  lb   369  lb ≈ 168  kg cheap anvils made from inferior steel or cast iron  which are unsuitable for serious use  have been derisively referred to as  asos   or  anvil shaped amateur smiths have used a piece of railroad rail as a makeshift anvil a metalworking vise may have a small anvil integrated into its design anvils were first made of stone as a lithic stone tool  then bronze  and later wrought iron  as steel became more readily available  anvils were faced with it  this was done to give the anvil a hard face and to stop the anvil from deforming from impact  many regional styles of anvils evolved through time from the simple block that was first used by smiths  the majority of anvils found today in the us are based on the london pattern anvil of the mid-19th  century the wrought iron steel faced anvil was produced up until the early 20th  century  through the 19th  and very early 20th  centuries  this method of construction evolved to produce extremely high quality anvils  the basic process involved forge-welding  billets of wrought iron together to produce the desired shape  the sequence and location of the forge-welds  varied between different anvil makers and the kind of anvil being made  at the same time cast iron anvils with steel faces were being made in the united states  at the dawn of the 20th  century solid cast steel anvils began to be produced  as well as two piece forged anvils made from closed die forgings  modern anvils are generally made entirely from steel there are many references to anvils in ancient greek and egyptian writings  including homer s works  they have been found at the calico early man site in north america anvils have since lost their former commonness  along with the smiths who used them  mechanized production has made cheap and abundant manufactured goods readily available  the one-off  handmade products of the blacksmith are less economically viable in the modern world  while in the past they were an absolute necessity  however  anvils are still used by blacksmiths and metal workers of all kinds in producing custom work  they are also essential to the work done by farriers application of the principles of the anvil predate historical human practice  there being a fair number of examples among various species of animals  some of the most thoroughly documented ethological examples of tool use by animals in the wild were of chimpanzees observed using hammers of wood or stone to crack nuts  with logs or rocks serving as less formally  birds such as some species of thrush have been known for centuries to crack the shells of the snails they feed on  by striking them on other species of birds have similar habits  notably some of the tropical pittas  and individual birds of many such species have their own particular anvils where their discarded shell middens accumulate anvils being by some definitions  ‘proto’ or ‘borderline’ tools         not directly manipulated and not detached from the substrate   some workers argue that their use is less demanding of brain power than more sophisticated tools  and they accordingly are likely to be used by organisms of a wider range of organisation of the central nervous system than say  probes  hammers  hooks and scoops  the latter would be limited to species with correspondingly advanced mental certainly anvil use occurs very widely in nature  ranging from fishes that break open the shells of molluscs much as thrushes to sea otters that bring stones to the surface and drift on their backs  holding the stones on their chests as anvils on which they break open clams and similar hard-shelled  gulls of various species  some crows  and large birds of prey smash open hard food items  such as bones and tortoises  by dropping them onto firing is the practice of firing an anvil into the air using gunpowder  it has been popular in california  the eastern united states and the southern united states  much like how fireworks are used today  there is a growing interest in re-enacting  this  ancient tradition  in the usa  which has now spread to african methodist episcopal church  ame  has the anvil in its coat of arms  the ame s first services were held in a blacksmith s shop a typical metalworker s anvil  with horn at one end and flat face at the other  is a standard prop for cartoon gags  as the epitome of a heavy and clumsy object that is perfect for dropping onto a villain  this visual metaphor is common  for example  in warner brothers  looney tunes and merrie melodies shorts  such as those with wile e  coyote and the road animaniacs made frequent gags on the topic throughout its run  even having a kingdom named anvilania  whose sole national product is anvils anvils have been used as percussion instruments in several famous musical compositions  including wagner s ring des nibelungen is notable in using the anvil as pitched percussion  the vast majority of extant works use the anvil as unpitched  however tuned anvils are available as musical instruments  albeit unusual  these are not to be confused with the  sawyers  anvils  used to  tune  big circular saw blades  steel anvils are used for tuning for use as musical instruments  because those based partly on cast iron and similar materials give a duller sound  this is actually valued in industry  as pure steel anvils are troublesomely noisy  though energetically more efficient the hammer and anvil have enjoyed varying popularity in orchestral roles  robert donington pointed out that sebastian virdung notes them in his book of 1510,  and martin agricola includes it in his list of instruments  musica instrumentalis deudsch  1529)  largely as a compliment to pythagoras  in pre-modern  or modern times anvils occasionally appear in operatic works by berlioz  bizet  gounod  verdi  and wagner for example  commonly pairs of anvils tuned a third apart are used in practice modern orchestras commonly substitute a steel bar or other suitable steel structure that is easier to tune than an actual anvil  although a visibly convincing anvil-shaped  prop may be shown as desired  in das rheingold wagner scored for nine little  six mid-sized,  and three large anvils  but orchestras seldom can afford instrumentation on such a chisholm  hugh  ed  (1911).   anvil   encyclopædia britannica (11th  ed    cambridge university press
