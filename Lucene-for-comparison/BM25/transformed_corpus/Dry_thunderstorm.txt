 dry thunderstorm -  wikipediaa dry thunderstorm or heat storm  is a thunderstorm that produces thunder and lightning  but most or all of its precipitation evaporates before reaching the and dry lightning is the term which is used to refer to lightning strikes occurring in this situation  both are so common in the american west that they are sometimes used the latter term is a technical misnomer since lightning itself is neither wet nor thunderstorms occur essentially in dry conditions  and their lightning is a major cause of because of that  the national weather service  and other agencies around the world  issue forecasts for its likelihood over large thunderstorms generally occur in deserts or places where the lower layers of the atmosphere usually contain little water vapor  any precipitation that falls from elevated thunderstorms can be entirely evaporated as it falls through the lower dry layers  they are common during the summer months across much of western north america and other arid areas  the shaft of precipitation that can be seen falling from a cloud without reaching the ground is called thunderstorm does not have to be completely dry to be considered dry  in many areas 0.1  inches (2.5  mm  is the threshold between a  wet  and  dry  thunderstorms are notable for two reasons  they are the most common natural origin of wildland fires  and they can produce strong gusty surface winds that can fan flames strong winds often develop around dry thunderstorms as the evaporating precipitation causes excessive cooling of the air beneath the storm  which increases its density and thereby its weight relative to the surrounding air  this cool air then descends rapidly and fans out upon impacting the ground  an event often described as a dry microburst  as the gusty winds expand outward from the storm  dry soil and sand are often picked up by the strong winds  creating dust and sand storms known as haboobs in areas where trees or other vegetation are present  there is little to no rain that can prevent the lightning from causing them to catch fire  storm winds also fan the fire and firestorm  causing it to spread more are cumuliform clouds that can form over a large fire and that are particularly when the higher levels of the atmosphere are cooler  and the surface is thus warmed to extreme temperatures due to a wildfire  volcano  or other event  convection will occur  and produce clouds and lightning  they are similar to any cumulus cloud but ingest extra particulates from the fire  this increases the voltage difference between the base and the top of the cloud  helping to produce lightning
