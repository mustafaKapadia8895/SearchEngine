 rainforest -  wikipediarainforests are forests characterized by high rainfall  with annual rainfall in the case of tropical rainforests between 250  and 450  centimetres (98  and 177  and definitions varying by region for temperate rainforests  the monsoon trough  alternatively known as the intertropical convergence zone  plays a significant role in creating the climatic conditions necessary for the earth s tropical rainforests around 40%  to 75%  of all biotic species are indigenous to the it has been estimated that there may be many millions of species of plants  insects and microorganisms still undiscovered in tropical rainforests  tropical rainforests have been called the  jewels of the earth  and the  world s largest pharmacy   because over one quarter of natural medicines have been discovered rainforests are also responsible for 28%  of the world s oxygen turnover  sometimes misnamed oxygen processing it through photosynthesis from carbon dioxide and consuming it through respiration the undergrowth in some areas of a rainforest can be restricted by poor penetration of sunlight to ground level  if the leaf canopy is destroyed or thinned  the ground beneath is soon colonized by a dense  tangled growth of vines  shrubs and small trees  called a jungle  the term jungle is also sometimes applied to tropical rainforests generally tropical rainforests are characterized by a warm and wet climate with no substantial dry season  typically found within 10  degrees north and south of the equator  mean monthly temperatures exceed 18  °c (64  °f  during all months of the average annual rainfall is no less than 168  cm (66  in  and can exceed 1,000  cm (390  in  although it typically lies between 175  cm (69  in  and 200  cm (79  of the world s tropical forests are associated with the location of the monsoon trough  also known as the intertropical convergence the broader category of tropical moist forests are located in the equatorial zone between the tropic of cancer and tropic of capricorn  tropical rainforests exist in southeast asia  from myanmar  burma  to the philippines  malaysia  indonesia  papua new guinea  sri lanka  sub-saharan  africa from cameroon to the congo  congo rainforest   south america  e g  the amazon rainforest   central america  e g  bosawás  southern yucatán peninsula-el  peten-belize-calakmul),  australia  and on many of the pacific islands  such as hawaiʻi   tropical forests have been called the  earth s lungs   although it is now known that rainforests contribute little net oxygen addition to the atmosphere through forests cover a large part of the globe  but temperate rainforests only occur in few regions around the world  temperate rainforests are rainforests in temperate regions  they occur in north america  in the pacific northwest in alaska  british columbia  washington  oregon and california   in europe  parts of the british isles such as the coastal areas of ireland and scotland  southern norway  parts of the western balkans along the adriatic coast  as well as in galicia and coastal areas of the eastern black sea  including georgia and coastal turkey   in east asia  in southern china  highlands of taiwan  much of japan and korea  and on sakhalin island and the adjacent russian far east coast   in south america  southern chile  and also in australia and new tropical rainforest typically has a number of layers  each with different plants and animals adapted for life in that particular area  examples include the emergent  canopy  understorey and forest floor layers the emergent layer contains a small number of very large trees called emergents  which grow above the general canopy  reaching heights of 45–55  m  although on occasion a few species will grow to 70–80  m they need to be able to withstand the hot temperatures and strong winds that occur above the canopy in some areas  eagles  butterflies  bats and certain monkeys inhabit this layer the canopy layer contains the majority of the largest trees  typically 30  metres (98  ft  to 45  metres (148  ft  tall  the densest areas of biodiversity are found in the forest canopy  a more or less continuous cover of foliage formed by adjacent treetops  the canopy  by some estimates  is home to 50  percent of all plant species  epiphytic plants attach to trunks and branches  and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants  the fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer  but more diverse  a quarter of all insect species are believed to exist in the rainforest canopy  scientists have long suspected the richness of the canopy as a habitat  but have only recently developed practical methods of exploring it  as long ago as 1917,  naturalist william beebe declared that  another continent of life remains to be discovered  not upon the earth  but one to two hundred feet above it  extending over thousands of square miles   true exploration of this habitat only began in the 1980s,  when scientists developed methods to reach the canopy  such as firing ropes into the trees using crossbows  exploration of the canopy is still in its infancy  but other methods include the use of balloons and airships to float above the highest branches and the building of cranes and walkways planted on the forest floor  the science of accessing tropical forest canopy using airships or similar aerial platforms is called understory or understorey layer lies between the canopy and the forest floor  it is home to a number of birds  snakes and lizards  as well as predators such as jaguars  boa constrictors and leopards  the leaves are much larger at this level and insect life is abundant  many seedlings that will grow to the canopy level are present in the understory  only about 5%  of the sunlight shining on the rainforest canopy reaches the understory  this layer can be called a shrub layer  although the shrub layer may also be considered a separate layer the forest floor  the bottom-most  layer  receives only 2%  of the sunlight  only plants adapted to low light can grow in this region  away from riverbanks  swamps and clearings  where dense undergrowth is found  the forest floor is relatively clear of vegetation because of the low sunlight penetration  it also contains decaying plant and animal matter  which disappears quickly  because the warm  humid conditions promote rapid decay  many forms of fungi growing here help decay the animal and plant waste more than half of the world s species of plants and animals are found in the rainforests support a very broad array of fauna  including mammals  reptiles  birds and invertebrates  mammals may include primates  felids and other families  reptiles include snakes  turtles  chameleons and other families  while birds include such families as vangidae and cuculidae  dozens of families of invertebrates are found in rainforests  fungi are also very common in rainforest areas as they can feed on the decomposing remains of plants and animals  many rainforest species are rapidly disappearing due to deforestation  habitat loss and pollution of the the growth of vegetation in a tropical rainforest  soil quality is often quite poor  rapid bacterial decay prevents the accumulation of humus  the concentration of iron and aluminium oxides by the laterization process gives the oxisols a bright red colour and sometimes produces mineral deposits such as bauxite  most trees have roots near the surface  because there are insufficient nutrients below the surface  most of the trees  minerals come from the top layer of decomposing leaves and animals  on younger substrates  especially of volcanic origin  tropical soils may be quite fertile  if rainforest trees are cleared  rain can accumulate on the exposed soil surfaces  creating run-off  and beginning a process of soil erosion  eventually streams and rivers form and flooding becomes possible  in the amazon rainforest  the trees are being cut down at a terrible rate and the soil which holds the trees isn t capable of doing anything but holding the trees  brazilian farmers have tried to farm with the soil with bad results a natural rainforest emits and absorbs vast quantities of carbon dioxide  on a global scale  long-term  fluxes are approximately in balance  so that an undisturbed rainforest would have a small net impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide though they may have other climatic effects  on cloud formation  for example  by recycling water vapour   no rainforest today can be considered to be human-induced  deforestation plays a significant role in causing rainforests to release carbon as do other factors  whether human-induced  or natural  which result in tree death  such as burning and some climate models operating with interactive vegetation predict a large loss of amazonian rainforest around 2050  due to drought  forest dieback and the subsequent release more carbon five million years from now  the amazon rainforest may long since have dried and transformed itself into savannah  killing itself in the progress  changes such as this may happen even if all human deforestation activity ceases the descendants of our known animals may adapt to the dry savannah of the former amazonian rainforest and thrive in the new  warmer rainforests provide timber as well as animal products such as meat and hides  rainforests also have value as tourism destinations and for the ecosystem services provided  many foods originally came from tropical forests  and are still mostly grown on plantations in regions that were formerly primary also  plant-derived  medicines are commonly used for fever  fungal infections  burns  gastrointestinal problems  pain  respiratory problems  and wound january 18,  2007,  funai reported also that it had confirmed the presence of 67  different uncontacted tribes in brazil  up from 40  in 2005.  with this addition  brazil has now overtaken the island of new guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted the province of irian jaya or west papua in the island of new guinea is home to an estimated 44  uncontacted tribal the tribes are in danger because of the deforestation  especially in brazil central african rainforest is home of the mbuti pygmies  one of the hunter-gatherer  peoples living in equatorial rainforests characterised by their short height  below one and a half metres  or 59  inches  on average   they were the subject of a study by colin turnbull  the forest people  in pygmies who live in southeast asia are  amongst others  referred to as “negrito” tropical and temperate rainforests have been subjected to heavy logging and agricultural clearance throughout the 20th  century and the area covered by rainforests around the world is biologists have estimated that large numbers of species are being driven to extinction  possibly more than 50,000  a year  at that rate  says e  o  wilson of harvard university  a quarter or more of all species on earth could be exterminated within 50  due to the removal of habitat with destruction of the rainforests another factor causing the loss of rainforest is expanding urban areas  littoral rainforest growing along coastal areas of eastern australia is now rare due to ribbon development to accommodate the demand for seachange forests are being destroyed at a rapid almost 90%  of west africa s rainforest has been since the arrival of humans  madagascar has lost two thirds of its original at present rates  tropical rainforests in indonesia would be logged out in 10  years and papua new guinea in 13  to 16  according to rainforest rescue  a main reason for the increasing deforestation rate especially in indonesia is the expansion of oil palm plantations to meet the growing demand for cheap vegetable fats and biofuels  in indonesia  palm oil is already cultivated on nine million hectares and  together with malaysia  the island nation produces about 85  percent of the world’s palm source  several notably brazil  have declared their deforestation a national amazon deforestation jumped by 69%  in 2008  compared to 2007's  twelve months  according to official government deforestation could wipe out or severely damage nearly 60%  of the amazon rainforest by 2030,  says a 2007  report from a january 30,  2009  new york times article stated   by one estimate  for every acre of rain forest cut down each year  more than 50  acres of new forest are growing in the tropics     the new forest includes secondary forest on former farmland and so-called  degraded
