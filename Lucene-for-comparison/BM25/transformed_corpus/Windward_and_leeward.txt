 windward and leeward -  wikipediawindward  pronounced  ˈwɪndwərd   is the direction upwind  toward where the wind is coming from  from the point of reference  leeward  pronounced  ˈliːwərd  or  ˈluːɜ ɹ d   is the direction downwind  or downward  from the point of reference  the side of a ship that is towards the leeward is its lee side  if the vessel is heeling under the pressure of the wind  this will be the  lower side   during the age of sail  the term weather was used as a synonym for windward in some contexts  as in the weather gage windward and leeward directions are important factors  points of sail  to consider when sailing a sailing ship  other terms with broadly the same meaning are widely used  particularly upwind and windward vessel is normally the more maneuverable vessel  for this reason  rule 12  of the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea stipulates that the windward vessel gives way to the leeward warfare  a square rigged warship would often try to enter battle from the windward direction  or  hold the weather gauge    thus gaining an important tactical advantage over the opposing warship – the warship to windward could choose when to engage and when to withdraw  the opposing warship to leeward could often do little but comply without exposing itself was particularly important once artillery was introduced to naval warfare  the ships heeled away from the wind so that the leeward vessel was exposing part of her bottom to and windward refer respectively to what a game stalker would call downwind and the terms are used by seamen in relation to their ships but also in reference to islands in an archipelago and to the different sides of a single island  in the latter case  the windward side is that side of an island subject to the prevailing wind  and is thus the wetter side  see orographic precipitation   the leeward side is the side protected by the elevation of the island from the prevailing wind  and is typically the drier side of an island  thus  leeward or windward siting is an important weather and climate factor on oceanic the case of an archipelago  windward islands are upwind and leeward islands are the downwind ones
