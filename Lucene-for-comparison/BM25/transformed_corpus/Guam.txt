pacific islands or of asian official languages of the island are english and chamorro according to the pew research center  chamorro guamanian culture is a combination of american  spanish  filipino  other micronesian islander and mexican traditions  few indigenous pre-hispanic  customs remained following spanish contact  hispanic influences are manifested in the local language  music  dance  sea navigation  cuisine  fishing  games  such as batu  chonka  estuleks  and bayogu   songs and fashion during spanish colonial rule (1668–1898)  the majority of the population was converted to roman catholicism and religious festivities such as easter and christmas became widespread  post-contact  chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn  and includes tortillas  tamales  atole and chilaquiles  which are a clear influence from mesoamerica  principally mexico  from spanish trade with asia the modern chamorro language has many historical parallels to modern philippine languages in that it is an austronesian language which has absorbed much spanish vocabulary  it is a malayo-polynesian  language  along with such languages as tagalog  indonesian  hawaiian  and even maori  despite being spoken in the mid pacific ocean  which is geographically closer to speakers of the polynesian islands  chamorro is actually an outlier of the sunda–sulawesi languages subgroup  chamorro is thus more closely related to  and a part of  the languages of the malay archipelago  rather than its neighbours in polynesia  among the languages of malay archipelago  chamorro is most closely related to the languages in the south of the chain of islands  within indonesia  rather than the languages of the north  in the philippines  with which it shares linguistic spanish colonial influence also like filipinos  many chamorros possess spanish surnames despite few of the inhabitants actually descending from the spanish colonisers  spanish names and surnames were adopted after their conversion to roman catholic christianity in a phenomenon prompted by the imposition of the catálogo alfabético de apellidos in guam and other territories of the spanish east indies  most notably the philippines due to foreign cultural influence from spain  most aspects of the early indigenous culture have been lost  though there has been a resurgence in preserving any remaining pre-hispanic  culture in the last few decades  some scholars have traveled throughout the pacific islands conducting research to study what the original chamorro cultural practices such as dance  language  and canoe building may have been like two aspects of indigenous pre-hispanic  culture that withstood time are chenchule  and inafa maolek  chenchule  is the intricate system of reciprocity at the heart of chamorro society  it is rooted in the core value of inafa maolek  historian lawrence cunningham in 1992  wrote   in a chamorro sense  the land and its produce belong to everyone  inafa maolek  or interdependence  is the key  or central value  in chamorro culture     inafa maolek depends on a spirit of cooperation and sharing  this is the armature  or core  that everything in chamorro culture revolves around  it is a powerful concern for mutuality rather than individualism and private property rights  the core culture or pengngan chamorro is based on complex social protocol centered upon respect  from sniffing over the hands of the elders  called mangnginge in chamorro   the passing down of legends  chants  and courtship rituals  to a person asking for permission from spiritual ancestors before entering a jungle or ancient battle grounds  other practices predating spanish conquest include galaide  canoe-making,  making of the belembaotuyan  a string musical instrument made from a gourd   fashioning of åcho  atupat slings and slingstones  tool manufacture  måtan guma  burial rituals  and preparation of herbal medicines by suruhanu master craftsmen and women specialize in weavings  including plaited work (niyok-  and åkgak-leaf  baskets  mats  bags  hats  and food containments   loom-woven  material (kalachucha-hibiscus  and banana fiber skirts  belts and burial shrouds   and body ornamentation  bead and shell necklaces  bracelets  earrings  belts and combs made from tortoise shells and spondylus  the cosmopolitan and multicultural nature of modern guam poses challenges for chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity amidst forces of acculturation  the increasing numbers of chamorros  especially chamorro youth  relocating to the u s  mainland has further complicated both definition and preservation of chamorro needed  while only a few masters exist to continue traditional art forms  the resurgence of interest among the chamorros to preserve the language and culture has resulted in a growing number of young chamorros who seek to continue the ancient ways of the chamorro people guam hosted the pacific games in 1975  and 1999.  at the 2007  games  guam finished 7th  of 22  countries and 14th  at the 2011  games the guam national football team was founded in 1975  and joined fifa in 1996.  guam was once considered one of fifa s weakest

environmental  and cultural familiarity  over the years  it was claimed by some in guam that the territory has had to bear the brunt of this agreement in the form of public assistance programs and public education for those from the regions involved  and the federal government should compensate the states and territories affected by this type of needed  over the years  congress had appropriated

s  military power to be projected via sea and sky the u s  military has proposed building a new aircraft carrier berth on guam and moving 8,600  marines  and 9,000  of their dependents  to guam from okinawa  japan  including the required construction workers  this buildup would increase guam s population by 45%.  in a february 2010  letter  the united states environmental protection agency sharply criticized these plans because of a water shortfall  sewage problems and the impact on coral by 2012,  these plans had been cut to have only a maximum of 4,800  marines stationed on the island  two thirds of whom would be there on a rotational basis without their the proposed increased military presence stemming from the upcoming preparation efforts and relocation efforts of u s  marines from okinawa  japan to guam slated to begin in 2010  and last for the next several years thereafter  the amount of total land that the military will control or tenant may grow to or surpass 40%  of the entire landmass of guam in january 2011,  the ike skelton national defense authorization act for fy2011  indicated that recent significant events will delay the deadline for realigning u s  marine corps service members and their families from okinawa to guam  the transfer may be as late as 2020.  in addition  the defense authorization act cut approximately $320  million from the 2011  budget request villagers and the military community are interconnected in many ways  many villagers serve in the military or are retired  many active duty personnel and defense department civilians also live in the villages outside of the military installation areas  the military and village communities have  adoption  programs where guam s population and military personnel stationed on guam perform community service projects most of the island has state-of-the-art  mobile phone services and high-speed  internet widely available through either cable or dsl  guam was added to the north american numbering plan  nanp  in 1997   country code 671  became nanp area code removing the barrier of high-cost  international long-distance  calls to the u s  mainland guam is also a major hub for submarine cables between the western u s   hawaii  australia and asia  guam currently serves twelve submarine cables  with most continuing to china in 1899,  the local postage stamps were overprinted  guam  as was done for the other former spanish colonies  but this was discontinued shortly thereafter and regular u s  postage stamps have been used ever since  because guam is also part of the u s  postal system  postal abbreviation  gu  zip code range  96910–96932),  mail to guam from the u s  mainland is considered domestic and no additional charges are required  private shipping companies  such as fedex  ups  and dhl  however  have no obligation to do so  and do not regard guam as domestic the speed of mail traveling between guam and the states varies depending on size and time of year  light  first-class  items generally take less than a week to or from the mainland  but larger first-class  or priority items can take a week or two  fourth-class  mail  such as magazines  are transported by sea after reaching hawaii  most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes  although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available  incoming mail not from the americas should be addressed to  guam  instead of  usa  to avoid being routed the long way through the u s  mainland and possibly charged a higher rate  especially from asia  the commercial port of guam is the island s lifeline because most products must be shipped into guam for consumers  it receives the weekly calls of the hawaii-based  shipping line matson  inc  whose container ships connect guam with honolulu  hawaii  los angeles  california  oakland  california and seattle  washington  the port is also the regional transhipment hub for over 500,000  customers throughout the micronesian region  the port is the shipping and receiving point for containers designated for the island s u s  department of defense installations  andersen air force base and commander  naval forces marianas and eventually the third marine expeditionary force guam is served by the antonio b  won pat international airport  which is a hub for united airlines  the island is outside the united states customs zone so guam is responsible for establishing and operating its own customs and quarantine agency and jurisdiction  therefore  the u s  customs and border protection only carries immigration  but not customs  functions  since guam is under federal immigration jurisdiction  passengers arriving directly from the united states skip immigration and proceed directly to guam customs and quarantine however  due to the guam and cnmi visa waiver program for certain countries  an eligibility pre-clearance  check is carried on guam for flights to the states  for travel from the northern mariana islands to guam  a pre-flight  passport and visa check is performed before boarding the flight to guam  on flights from guam to the northern mariana islands  no immigration check is performed  traveling between guam and the states through a foreign point  however  does require a passport most residents travel within guam using personally owned vehicles  the local government currently outsources the only public bus system  guam regional transit authority   and some commercial companies operate buses between tourist-frequented  locationsbelieved to be a stowaway on a u s  military transport near the end of world war ii  the brown tree snake  boiga irregularis  was accidentally introduced to guam  which previously had no native species of snake  it nearly eliminated the native bird population  the problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island  the brown tree snake  known locally as the kulebla  is native to northern and eastern coasts of australia  papua new guinea  and the solomon islands  it is slightly venomous  but relatively harmless to human beings  it is nocturnal  although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on guam  residents rarely see them  the united states department of agriculture has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the island s cargo flow  the united states geological survey also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the region s the introduction of the brown tree snake  guam was home to several endemic bird species  among them were the guam rail  or ko ko  bird in chamorro  and the guam flycatcher  both common throughout the island  today the flycatcher is entirely extinct and the guam rail is extinct in the wild but bred in captivity by the division of aquatic and wildlife resources  the devastation caused by the snake has been significant over the past several decades  as many as twelve bird species are believed to have been driven to according to many elders  ko ko  birds were common in guam before world war bird species threatened by the brown tree snake include the mariana crow  the mariana swiftlet  and the micronesian starling  though populations are present on other islands  including is said to have many more insects and 40  times more spiders than neighboring islands  because their natural predators birds are severely diminished  and the forests are almost completely silent due to lack of infestation of the coconut rhinoceros beetle  crb   oryctes rhinoceros  was detected on guam on september 12,  2007.  crb is not known to occur in the united states except in american samoa  delimiting surveys performed september 13–25,  2007,  indicated that the infestation was limited to tumon bay and faifai beach  an area of approximately 900  acres (3.6  km2).  guam department of agriculture  gda  placed quarantine on all properties within the tumon area on october 5  and later expanded the quarantine to about 2,500  acres (10  km2)  on october 25;  approximately 0.5  miles (800  m  radius in all directions from all known locations of crb infestation  crb is native to southern asia and distributed throughout asia and the western pacific including sri lanka  upolu  samoa  american samoa  palau  new britain  west irian  new ireland  pak island and manus island  new guinea   fiji  cocos  keeling  islands  mauritius  and reunion from the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries  the spanish introduced pigs  dogs  chickens  the philippine deer  rusa mariannus   black francolins  and carabao  a subspecies of water buffalo   which have cultural significance  herds of carabao obstruct military base operations and harm native ecosystems  after birth control and adoption efforts were ineffective  the u s  military began culling the herds in 2002  leading to organized protests from island introduced species include cane toads imported in 1937,  the giant african snail  an agricultural pest introduced during world war ii by japanese occupation troops  and more recently frog species which could threaten crops in addition to providing additional food for the brown tree snake population  reports of loud chirping frogs native to puerto rico and known as coquí  that may have arrived from hawaii  have led to fears that the noise could threaten guam s has no native amphibian species  but now a total of eight amphibian species has been established in guam  litoria fallax  native to the eastern coast of australia  has been present in guam since 1968,  and rhinella marina  the cane toad  was brought to the island in 1937.  the other 6  amphibian species  namely hylarana guentheri  native to mainland asia   microhyla pulchra  native to mainland asia   polypedates braueri  endemic to taiwan   eleutherodactylus planirostris  native to the caribbean   fejervarya cancrivora  the guam variety being most closely related to f  cancrivora found in taiwan   and fejervarya limnocharis  native to southeast asia   have been in guam since many species were likely inadvertently introduced via shipping cargo  especially from taiwan  mainland china  and southeast asia introduced feral pigs and deer  over-hunting,  and habitat loss from human development are also major factors in the decline and loss of guam s native plants and animals invading animal species are not the only threat to guam s native flora  tinangaja  a virus affecting coconut palms  was first observed on the island in 1917  when copra production was still a major part of guam s economy  though coconut plantations no longer exist on the island  the dead and infected trees that have resulted from the epidemic are seen throughout the forests of the past century  the dense forests of northern guam have been largely replaced by thick tangan-tangan  brush  leucaena leucocephala   much of guam s foliage was lost during world war ii  in 1947,  the u s  military is thought to have planted tangan-tangan  by seeding the island from the air to prevent erosion  tangan-tangan  was present on the island before southern guam  non-native  grass species dominate much of the landscape  although the colorful and impressive flame tree  delonix regia  is found throughout the marianas  the tree on guam has been largely decimated wildfires plague the forested areas of guam every dry season despite the island s humid climate  most fires are caused by humans with 80%  resulting from poachers often start fires to attract deer to the new growth  invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas  grasslands and  barrens  have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion  during the rainy season  sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the fena lake reservoir and ugum river  leading to water quality problems for southern guam  eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island  soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers  planting trees  have had little success in preserving natural have been made to protect guam s coral reef habitats from pollution  eroded silt and overfishing  problems that have led to decreased fish populations   since guam is a significant vacation spot for scuba divers  this is important   in recent years  the department of agriculture  division of aquatic and wildlife resources has established several new marine preserves where fish populations are monitored by before adopting u s  environmental protection agency standards  portions of tumon bay were dredged by the hotel chains to provide a better experience for hotel tumon bay has since been made into a preserve  a federal guam national wildlife refuge in northern guam protects the decimated sea turtle population in addition to a small colony of mariana fruit of sea turtle eggs was a common occurrence on guam before world war ii  the green sea turtle  chelonia mydas  was harvested legally on guam before august 1978,  when it was listed as threatened under the endangered species act  the hawksbill sea turtle  eretmochelys imbricata  has been on the endangered list since 1970.  in an effort to ensure protection of sea turtles on guam  routine sightings are counted during aerial surveys and nest sites are recorded and monitored for hatchlings
