 triassic–jurassic extinction event -  wikipediathe triassic–jurassic extinction event marks the boundary between the triassic and jurassic periods  201.3  million years and is one of the major extinction events of the phanerozoic eon  profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans  in the seas  a whole class and 34%  of marine genera on land  all archosaurs other than crocodylomorphs  sphenosuchia and crocodyliformes  and avemetatarsalia  pterosaurs and dinosaurs   some remaining therapsids  and many of the large amphibians became extinct at least half of the species now known to have been living on earth at that time became extinct  this event vacated terrestrial ecological niches  allowing the dinosaurs to assume the dominant roles in the jurassic period  this event happened in less than 10,000  years and occurred just before pangaea started to break apart  in the area of tübingen  germany   a triassic-jurassic  bonebed can be found  which is characteristic for this analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a decrease in speciation than by an increase in explanations for this event have been suggested  but all have unanswered challenges millions of years before present
