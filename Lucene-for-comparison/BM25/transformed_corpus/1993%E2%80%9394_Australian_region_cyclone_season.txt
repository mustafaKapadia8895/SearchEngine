 1993–94  australian region cyclone season -  wikipediathe 1993–94  australian region cyclone season was a slightly above average australian cyclone season  it was also an event in the ongoing cycle of tropical cyclone formation  it ran from 1  november 1993  to 30  april 1994.  the regional tropical cyclone operational plan also defines a tropical cyclone year separately from a tropical cyclone season  and the  tropical cyclone year  ran from 1  july 1993  to 30  june 1994.tropical  cyclones in this area were monitored by four tropical cyclone warning centres  tcwcs   the australian bureau of meteorology in perth  darwin  and brisbane  and tcwc port moresby in papua new guinea naomi was the first cyclone of the 1993/94  season  forming early on 15  december 1993,  the storm moved south and strengthened into a category 3  before making there was moderate damage and a fishing boat was disabled during the storm  there were no deaths cyclone rewa formed on 26  december 1993.  it looped around the coral sea for almost a month  crossed new caledonia and the solomon island  and dissipated on 21  january  rewa was the longest-lived  south pacific tropical cyclone on record  lasting 25  days  from 26  december to 21  january cyclone oscar was a weak system  and only barely reached cyclone strength on 3  january 1994  for about a 12-hour  period  it moved on a generally west-southwest  course parallel to the kimberley and pilbara january 11,  a tropical low formed northwest of broome  western australia  it was named pearl a few hours later by the bureau of the cyclone continued westward and reached a peak intensity of 155  km h (100  as the system moved west of 90°e,  mfr took over warning responsibility on january 18  and renamed the cyclone at that time  mfr estimated winds of about 120  km h (75  after having moved westward due to a ridge to the south  farah turned to the south upon entering the basin due to an approaching trough  which previously absorbed edmea  high wind shear caused rapid weakening  and by january 19,  there was little remaining convection  the next day  farah weakened to tropical depression status and turned to the southeast  the ridge built behind the trough  causing the depression to stall and drift northward  and by february 22,  farah cyclone quenton began as a tropical low to the east of christmas island on 22  january 1994.  the low moved slowly west  then on 25  january intensified to cyclone strength and moved southward across the indian ocean  by early on the 29th  the cyclone had on 29  january  the bom reported that a tropical low had developed within the monsoon trough about 50  km (30  mi  to the north of the gove peninsula in the northern during that day the low rapidly developed further as it moved south-eastwards,  before early on 29  january tcwc brisbane reported that the low had developed into a category 1  tropical cyclone and named it sadie as the system started to move later that day the jtwc initiated advisories on cyclone sadie and designated it as tropical cyclone 14p,  while the system started to move towards the east and was near its peak 1-minute  maximum sustained windspeeds of 85  km h (50  early the next day cyclone sadie made landfall to the north of near normanton  after tcwc brisbane had reported that the system had peaked with 10-minute  maximum sustained winds of 85  km h (50  after making landfall  the system moved towards the south-southeast  before weakening and degenerating into a tropical low rain depression later that tropical cyclone theodore existed from 22  february to 28  february tropical cyclone sharon was the most intense cyclone in the western australian region during the 1993/94  season  it formed about 1100  km north of northwest cape on 12  march 1994,  then rapidly intensified during the 14th  while moving on a south-southwest  path towards the west pilbara coast  during the 16th  the cyclone rapidly weakened due to movement into a region of strong westerly wind shear  cyclone warnings were issued for the west pilbara and upper west coast on the 16th  but were cancelled on the morning of the 17th  continued shearing and subsequent movement over cooler waters weakened the storm to below cyclone strength by the morning of the cyclone tim was a very small weak system that moved on a generally westward path from south of sumatra to the cocos islands from 28  march to 3  april 1994.  it passed about 100  km to the south of christmas island but its effects  other than a wind shift  were barely recognizable on the cyclone vivienne formed from a tropical low that had moved westward across the timor sea  it intensified rapidly during the afternoon and night of 5  april 1994,  reaching maximum intensity on 8  april when it was located 550  km to the north-northwest  of broome  its development from here on was hampered by vertical wind shear and vivienne moved on a generally west-southwest  path parallel to  but well offshore from  the western australian coastline  it dissipated on 13  april and no watches or warnings were 20  april  the jtwc started to monitor an area of low pressure that located over the solomon islands about 155  km (95  mi  to the north of during that day the disturbance moved towards the southeast and passed over several of the solomon islands  before emerging into the australian over the next couple of days the disturbance gradually developed further while moving towards the southwest before re-curving  and moving on 24  april  as it moved back into the south pacific basin  the jtwc initiated advisories on the disturbance  designating it as tropical cyclone 29p,  with peak windspeeds equivalent to a tropical as the system was classified  it recurved again and started to move slowly towards the northwest  and started to feel the effects of a high amount of vertical as a result of the windshear  the center became exposed and displaced from the deep convection before the jtwc issued their final advisory on 25  april as 29p  weakened into an area of low pressure  before dissipating later that day about 600  km (375  mi  to the southwest of was a category 1  cyclone lasting from 26  april to 1  may 1994  that passed about 80  km west of the cocos march 23,  a weak tropical low developed within the south pacific convergence zone near papua new guinea s louisiade archipelago  within an area of favourable surface and upper air conditions for further over the next day the system moved eastwards and gradually developed further  before tcwc port moresby reported that the system had developed into a category 1  tropical cyclone on the australian scale and named it usha during the next day as it moved out of the australian
