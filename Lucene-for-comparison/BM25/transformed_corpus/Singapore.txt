1963  by federating with other former british territories to form malaysia  but separated two years later over ideological differences  becoming a sovereign nation in 1965.  after early years of

parliamentary republic  with a westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government  the people s action party has won every election since self-government  in 1959.  the dominance of the pap  coupled with a low level of press freedom and restrictions on civil liberties and political rights  has led to singapore being classified by some as a semi-authoritarian  regime  one of the five founding members of asean  singapore is also the host of the asia-pacific  economic cooperation  apec  secretariat and a member of the east asia summit  non-aligned  movement and the commonwealth of nations the english name of singapore is an anglicisation of the native malay name for the country  singapura  which was in turn derived from  सिंहपुर  iast  siṃhapura  siṃha is  lion   pura is  town  or  city    hence the customary reference to the nation as the lion city  and its inclusion in many of the nation s symbols  e g   its coat of arms  merlion emblem   however  it is unlikely that lions ever lived on the island  sang nila utama  the srivijayan prince said to have founded and named the island singapura  perhaps saw a malayan tiger  there are however other suggestions for the origin of the name and scholars do not believe that the origin of the name to be firmly the central island has also been called pulau ujong as far back as the third century ce  literally  island at the end   of the malay peninsula  in the lion city -  a translation of its ancient sanskrit name  singapore is also referred to as garden city for its tree-lined  streets and greening efforts since and the little red dot for how the island-nation  is depicted on many maps of the world and asia  as a red greco-roman  astronomer ptolemy (90–168)  identified a place called sabana in the general area in the second and the earliest written record of singapore occurs in a chinese account from the third century  describing the island of pu luo chung  蒲 罗 中   this was itself a transliteration from the malay name  pulau ujong   or  island at the end   of the malay the nagarakretagama  a javanese epic poem written in 1365,  referred to a settlement on the island called tumasik  possibly meaning  sea in 1299,  according to the malay annals  the kingdom of singapura was founded on the island by sang nila although the historicity of the accounts as given in the malay annals is the subject of academic it is nevertheless known from various documents that singapore in the 14th  century  then known as temasek  was a trading port under the influence of both the majapahit empire and the siamese inside of greater these indianized kingdoms  a term coined by george cœdès were characterized by surprising resilience  political integrity and administrative historical sources also indicate that around the end of the 14th  century  its ruler parameswara was attacked by either the majapahit or the siamese  forcing him to move on to melaka where he founded the sultanate of archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on fort canning was abandoned around this time  although a small trading settlement continued in singapore for some time in 1613,  portuguese raiders burned down the settlement  and the island faded into obscurity for the next two by then singapore was nominally part of the johor the wider maritime region and much trade was under dutch control for the following period raffles arrived in singapore on 28  january 1819  and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port  the island was then nominally ruled by the sultan of johor  who was controlled by the dutch and the bugis  however  the sultanate was weakened by factional division and tengku abdu r rahman and his officials were loyal to tengku rahman s elder brother tengku long who was living in exile in riau  with the temenggong s help  raffles managed to smuggle tengku long back into singapore  he offered to recognize tengku long as the rightful sultan of johor  given the title of sultan hussein and provide him with a yearly payment of $5000  and $3000  to the temenggong  in return  sultan hussein would grant the british the right to establish a trading post on a formal treaty was signed on 6  february 1819  and modern singapore was 1824,  the entire island as well as the temenggong became a british possession after a further treaty with the in 1826,  singapore became part of the straits settlements  under the jurisdiction of british india  becoming the regional capital in prior to raffles  arrival  there were only about a thousand people living on the island  mostly indigenous malays along with a handful of by 1860  the population had swelled to over 80,000,  more than half being many of these early immigrants came to work on the pepper and gambier later  in the 1890s,  when the rubber industry also became established in malaya and the island became a global centre for rubber sorting and was not much affected by first world war (1914–18),  as the conflict did not spread to southeast asia  the only significant event during the war was a mutiny by the muslim sepoys from british india who were garrisoned in singapore  which occurred in 1915.  after hearing rumours that they were to be sent off to fight the ottoman empire  which was a muslim state  the soldiers rebelled  they killed their officers and several british civilians before the mutiny was suppressed by non-muslim  troops arriving from johore and burma after the first world war  the british built the large singapore naval base as part of the defensive singapore strategy  originally announced in 1923,  the construction of the base proceeded slowly until the japanese invasion of manchuria in 1931.  when completed in 1939,  at the very large cost of $500  million  it boasted what was then the largest dry dock in the world  the third-largest  floating dock  and having enough fuel tanks to support the entire british navy for six months  it was defended by heavy 15-inch  naval guns stationed at fort siloso  fort canning and labrador  as well as a royal air force airfield at tengah air base  winston churchill touted it as the  gibraltar of the east  and military discussions often referred to the base as simply  east of suez   unfortunately  it was a base without a fleet  the british home fleet was stationed in europe  and the british could not afford to build a second fleet to protect its interests in asia  the plan was for the home fleet to sail quickly to singapore in the event of an emergency  however  after world war ii broke out in 1939,  the fleet was fully occupied with defending the second world war  the imperial japanese army invaded british malaya  culminating in the battle of singapore  when the british force of 60,000  troops surrendered on 15  february 1942,  british prime minister winston churchill called the defeat  the worst disaster and largest capitulation in british british losses during the fighting for singapore were heavy  with a total of nearly 85,000  personnel captured  in addition to losses during the earlier fighting in about 5,000  were killed or of which australians made up the japanese casualties during the fighting in singapore amounted to 1,714  killed and 3,378  wounded  1].  the occupation was to become a major turning point in the histories of several nations  including those of japan  britain  and the then-colonial  state of singapore  japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding the general situation of the singapore was renamed syonan-to   昭南島

before these operations could be carried out  it was subsequently re-occupied  by british  indian and australian forces following the japanese surrender in meanwhile  tomoyuki yamashita was tried by a us military commission for war crimes  but not for crimes committed by his troops in malaya or singapore  he was convicted and hanged in the philippines on 23  february the japanese surrender to the allies on 15  august 1945,  singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder  looting and revenge-killing  were widespread  british troops led by lord louis mountbatten  supreme allied commander for southeast asia command  returned to singapore to receive formal surrender of the japanese forces in the region from general itagaki seishiro on behalf of general hisaichi terauchi on 12  september 1945,  and a british military administration was formed to govern the island until march 1946.  much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war  including harbor facilities at the port of singapore  there was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition  disease  and rampant crime and violence  high food prices  unemployment  and workers  discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947  causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services  by late 1947,  the economy began to recover  facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world  but it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war  failure of britain to successfully defend singapore had destroyed its credibility as infallible ruler in the eyes of singaporeans  the decades after the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of anti-colonial  and nationalist sentiments  epitomized by the slogan merdeka  or  independence  in the malay language  the british  on their part  were prepared to gradually increase self-governance  for singapore and on 1  april 1946,  the straits settlements was dissolved and singapore became a separate crown colony with a civil administration headed by a governor  in july 1947,  separate executive and legislative councils were established and the election of six members of the legislative council was scheduled in the following the 1950s,  chinese communists with strong ties to the trade unions and chinese schools waged a guerrilla war against the government  leading to the malayan emergency  the 1954  national service riots  chinese middle schools riots  and hock lee bus riots in singapore were all linked to these david marshall  pro-independence  leader of the labour front  won singapore s first general election in 1955.  he led a delegation to london  but britain rejected his demand for complete self-rule.  he resigned and was replaced by lim yew hock in 1956,  whose policies convinced britain to grant singapore full internal self-government  for all matters except defence and foreign the may 1959  elections  the people s action party won a landslide victory  singapore became an internally self-governing  state within the commonwealth  with lee kuan yew as its first prime as a result  the 1959  general elections were the first after full internal self-government  was granted by the british authorities  singapore was not yet fully independent  as the british still controlled external affairs such as the military and foreign relations  however  singapore was now a recognised state  governor sir william allmond codrington goode served as the first yang di-pertuan  negara  head of state   and was succeeded by yusof bin their successes in governing singapore  the pap leaders believed that singapore s future lay with malaya due to strong ties between the two nations  it was thought that the merger would benefit the economy by creating a common market which will support new industries  thus solving the ongoing unemployment woes in singapore  however  a sizable pro-communist  wing of the pap were strongly opposed to the merger  fearing a loss of needed   this is because the ruling party of malaya  united malays national organisation  was staunchly anti-communist  and would support the non-communist  faction of pap against them  umno  who were initially skeptical of the idea of a merger as they distrust the pap government and were concerned that the large chinese population in singapore would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended  changed their minds about the merger after being afraid of being taken over by pro-communists.  on 27  may  malaya s prime minister  tunku abdul rahman  mooted the idea of a federation of malaysia  comprising existing federation of malaya  singapore  brunei and the british borneo territories of north borneo and the umno leaders believed that the additional malay population in the borneo territories would offset singapore s chinese the british government  for its part  believed that the merger would prevent singapore from becoming a haven for a result of the 1962  merger referendum  on 16  september 1963  singapore joined with the federation of malaya  the crown colony of sarawak and the crown colony of north borneo to form the new federation of malaysia under the terms of the malaysia agreement  given singapore s limited size and lack of natural resources  it was felt integrating with malaya would provide a route to stronger economic development  the merger would also give the pap legitimacy  and remove the threat of communist government over however  shortly after the merger  the singapore state government and the malaysian central government disagreed on many political and economic issues  and communal strife culminated in the 1964  race riots in singapore on 10  march 1965,  a bomb planted by indonesian saboteurs on a mezzanine floor of macdonald house exploded  killing three people and injuring 33  others  it was the deadliest of at least 42  bomb incidents which occurred during the two members of the indonesian marine corps  osman bin haji mohamed ali and harun bin said  were eventually convicted and executed for the the macdonald house suffered $250,000  bomb were many heated ideological conflicts between the two governments  even on the economic front  despite an earlier agreement to establish a common market  singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of malaysia  in retaliation  singapore did not extend to sabah and sarawak the full extent of the loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states  the situation escalated to such an intensity that talks soon broke down and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides  because of this  on 7  august 1965,the  then malaysian prime minister tunku abdul rahman  seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed  advised the parliament of malaysia that it should vote to expel singapore from on 9  august 1965,  the malaysian parliament voted 126  to 0   with singaporean delegates not present  to move a bill to amend the constitution providing for singapore to separate from the federation of gained independence as the republic of singapore  remaining within the commonwealth of nations  on 9  august 1965

yew became prime minister  and the country moved from third world economy to first world affluence in a single generation  lee kuan yew s emphasis on rapid economic growth  support for business entrepreneurship  and limitations on internal democracy shaped singapore s policies for the next further economic success continued through the 1980s,  with the unemployment rate falling to 3%  and real gdp growth averaging at about 8%  up until 1999.  during the 1980s,  singapore began to upgrade to higher-technological  industries  such as the wafer fabrication sector  in order to compete with
