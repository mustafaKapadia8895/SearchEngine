 nitric oxide -  wikipediadinitrogen tetroxide dinitrogen trioxide nitrogen dioxide nitrous oxide nitroxyl  reduced form  hydroxylamine  hydrogenated form nitric oxide  nitrogen nitrogen monoxide  is a molecular  chemical compound with chemical formula of ·no  one of several oxides of nitrogen  it is a colorless gas under standard conditions  nitric oxide is a free radical—i e   its bonding structure includes an unpaired represented by the dot  ·  on the nitrogen atom—and it is in the class of heteronuclear diatomic molecules that are of historic theoretical interest  for the insights they gave in formulating early modern theories of bonding   it is a particularly important intermediate in the chemical industry  in addition  nitric oxide is formed in nitrogen-oxygen  mixtures at high-temperature  conditions  such as those found in combustion systems including internal combustion piston engines  gas turbines  industrial furnaces  and boilers  it is also produced naturally by the extremely high air temperatures produced along the path of lightning in thunderstorms in mammals including humans  nitric oxide is an important cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological it is a powerful vasodilator with a short half-life  of a few seconds in the blood  long-known  pharmaceuticals such as nitroglycerine and amyl nitrite were found to be precursors to nitric oxide more than a century after their first use in medicine  low levels of nitric oxide production are important in protecting organs such as the liver from ischemic damage  nitric oxide production is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease  nafld  and is essential for hepatic lipid metabolism under a consequence of its importance in neuroscience  physiology  and immunology  nitric oxide was proclaimed  molecule of the year  in research into its function led to the 1998  nobel prize for discovering the role of nitric oxide as a cardiovascular signalling molecule  nitric oxide should not be confused with nitrous oxide (n2o),  an anesthetic  or with nitrogen dioxide (no2),  a brown toxic gas and a major air pollutant  the latter being a product to which nitric oxide is rapidly oxidized in air it is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the united states as defined in section 302  of the u s  emergency planning and community right-to-know  act (42  u s c  11002),  and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce  store  or use it in significant commercial settings  nitric oxide is produced by the oxidation of ammonia at 750–900  °c  normally at 850  °c  with platinum as catalyst the uncatalyzed endothermic reaction of oxygen (o2)  and nitrogen (n2),  which is performed at high temperature (>2000  °c  by lightning has not been developed into a practical commercial synthesis  see birkeland–eyde process  in the laboratory  nitric oxide is conveniently generated by reduction of dilute nitric acid with copper or by the reduction of nitrous acid in the form of sodium nitrite or potassium nitrite the iron ii  sulfate route is simple and has been used in undergraduate laboratory experiments  so-called  nonoate compounds are also used for nitric oxide generation nitric oxide reacts with all transition metals to give complexes called metal nitrosyls  the most common bonding mode of nitric oxide is the terminal linear type  m−no   the angle of the m−n−o group varies from 160°  to 180°  but is still termed  linear   in this case  the nitric oxide group is considered a 3-electron  donor under the covalent  neutral  method of electron counting  or a 2-electron  donor under the ionic one can view such complexes as derived from no   which is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide  co  in the case of a bent m−n−o conformation  the ·no group can be considered a one-electron  donor using neutral counting  or a 2-electron  donor using ionic oxide can serve as a one-electron  pseudohalide  in such complexes  the m−n−o group is characterized by an angle between 120°  and 140°.the  ·no group can also bridge between metal centers through the nitrogen atom in a variety of geometries nitric oxide concentration can be determined using a simple chemiluminescent reaction involving a sample containing nitric oxide is mixed with a large quantity of ozone  the nitric oxide reacts with the ozone to produce oxygen and nitrogen dioxide  accompanied with emission of light  chemiluminescence  which can be measured with a photodetector  the amount of light produced is proportional to the amount of nitric oxide in the sample other methods of testing include electroanalysis  amperometric approach   where ·no reacts with an electrode to induce a current or voltage change  the detection of no radicals in biological tissues is particularly difficult due to the short lifetime and concentration of these radicals in tissues  one of the few practical methods is spin trapping of nitric oxide with iron-dithiocarbamate  complexes and subsequent detection of the mono-nitrosyl-iron  complex with electron paramagnetic resonance group of fluorescent dye indicators that are also available in acetylated form for intracellular measurements exist  the most common compound is 4,5-diaminofluorescein  a thermodynamic perspective  ·no is unstable with respect to o2  and n2,  although this conversion is very slow at ambient temperatures in the absence of a catalyst  because the heat of formation of ·no is endothermic  its synthesis from molecular nitrogen and oxygen requires elevated temperatures above 1000  °c a major natural source is lightning  the use of internal combustion engines has drastically increased the presence of nitric oxide in the environment  one purpose of catalytic converters in cars is to minimize ·no emission by catalytic reversion to o2  and n2.nitric  oxide reacts with the hydroperoxy radical (ho2•)  to form nitrogen dioxide (no2),  which then can react with a hydroxyl radical  •oh  to produce nitric acid (hno3):nitric  acid  along with sulfuric acid  contribute acid rain deposition furthermore  ·no participates in ozone layer depletion  in this process  nitric oxide reacts with stratospheric ozone to form o2  and nitrogen dioxide as seen in the concentration measurement section  this reaction is also utilized to measure concentrations of ·no in control volumes as seen in the acid deposition section  nitric oxide can transform into nitrogen dioxide  this can happen with the hydroperoxy radical  ho2•,  or diatomic oxygen  o2).  symptoms of short-term  nitrogen dioxide exposure include nausea  dyspnea and headache  long-term  effects could include impaired immune and respiratory ·no has relatively few direct uses  it is produced on a massive scale as an intermediate in the ostwald process for the synthesis of nitric acid from ammonia  in 2005,  the us alone produced 6  million metric tons of nitric it finds use in the semiconductor industry for various processes  in one of its applications  it is used along with nitrous oxide to form oxynitride gates in cmos devices nitric oxide can be used for detecting surface radicals on polymers  quenching of surface radicals with nitric oxide results in incorporation of nitrogen  which can be quantified by means of x-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy no is one of the few gaseous signaling molecules known and is additionally exceptional due to the fact that it is a radical gas  it is a key vertebrate biological messenger  playing a role in a variety of biological it is a known bioproduct in almost all types of organisms  ranging from bacteria to plants  fungi  and animal oxide  known as an endothelium-derived  relaxing factor  edrf   is biosynthesized endogenously from l-arginine,  oxygen  and nadph by various nitric oxide synthase  nos  enzymes  reduction of inorganic nitrate may also serve to make nitric oxide  the endothelium  inner lining  of blood vessels uses nitric oxide to signal the surrounding smooth muscle to relax  thus resulting in vasodilation and increasing blood flow  nitric oxide is highly reactive  having a lifetime of a few seconds   yet diffuses freely across membranes  these attributes make nitric oxide ideal for a transient paracrine  between adjacent cells  and autocrine  within a single cell  signaling of nitric oxide synthase  an alternative pathway  coined the nitrate-nitrite-nitric  oxide pathway  elevates nitric oxide through the sequential reduction of dietary nitrate derived from plant-based  nitrate-rich  vegetables  in particular leafy greens  such as spinach and arugula  and beetroot  have been shown to increase cardioprotective levels of nitric oxide with a corresponding reduction in blood pressure in pre-hypertensive  for the body to generate nitric oxide through the nitrate-nitrite-nitric  oxide pathway  the reduction of nitrate to nitrite  by nitrate reductase  a bacterial enzyme  occurs in the mouth  by commensal bacteria  an obligatory and necessary monitoring nitric oxide status by saliva testing detects the bioconversion of plant-derived  nitrate into nitric oxide  a rise in salivary levels is indicative of diets rich in leafy vegetables which are often abundant in anti-hypertensive  diets such as the dash production of nitric oxide is elevated in populations living at high altitudes  which helps these people avoid hypoxia by aiding in pulmonary vasculature vasodilation  effects include vasodilatation  neurotransmission  see gasotransmitters   modulation of the hair production of reactive nitrogen intermediates and penile erections  through its ability to vasodilate   nitroglycerin and amyl nitrite serve as vasodilators because they are converted to nitric oxide in the body  the vasodilating antihypertensive drug minoxidil contains an ·no moiety and may act as an no agonist  likewise  sildenafil citrate  popularly known by the trade name viagra  stimulates erections primarily by enhancing signaling through the nitric oxide pathway in the penis nitric oxide  no  contributes to vessel homeostasis by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle contraction and growth  platelet aggregation  and leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium  humans with atherosclerosis  diabetes  or hypertension often show impaired no a high salt intake was demonstrated to attenuate no production in patients with essential hypertension  although bioavailability remains oxide is also generated by phagocytes  monocytes  macrophages  and neutrophils  as part of the human immune phagocytes are armed with inducible nitric oxide synthase  inos   which is activated by interferon-gamma  (ifn-γ)  as a single signal or by tumor necrosis factor  tnf  along with a second on the other hand  transforming growth factor-beta  (tgf-β)  provides a strong inhibitory signal to inos  whereas interleukin-4  (il-4)  and il-10  provide weak inhibitory signals  in this way  the immune system may regulate the armamentarium of phagocytes that play a role in inflammation and immune nitric oxide is secreted as free radicals in an immune response and is toxic to bacteria and intracellular parasites  including and the mechanism for this includes dna and degradation of iron sulfur centers into iron ions and iron-nitrosyl  inducible pathway  inos  of nitrogen oxide synthesis in phagocytes can generate large amounts of ·no that trigger apoptosis in and thereby the death of cells  in vitro studies indicate that phagocyte-dependent  generation of ·no at concentrations greater than 400-500  nm triggers apoptosis in nearby cells and that this effect may act in a manner similar to specialized pro-resolving  mediators to dampen and reverse inflammatory responses by neutralizing and then speeding the clearance of pro-inflammatory  cells from inflamed however  the role of ·no in inflammation is complex with model studies involving viral infection suggesting that this gaseous mediator can also promote response  many bacterial pathogens have evolved mechanisms for nitric oxide because nitric oxide might serve as an inflammometer  meter of inflammation  in conditions like asthma  there has been increasing interest in the use of exhaled nitric oxide as a breath test in diseases with airway inflammation  reduced levels of exhaled no have been associated with exposure to air pollution in cyclists and smokers  but  in general  increased levels of exhaled no are associated with exposure to air oxide can contribute to reperfusion injury when an excessive amount produced during reperfusion  following a period of ischemia  reacts with superoxide to produce the damaging oxidant peroxynitrite  in contrast  inhaled nitric oxide has been shown to help survival and recovery from paraquat poisoning  which produces lung tissue-damaging  superoxide and hinders nos metabolism in plants  nitric oxide can be produced by any of four routes   i  l-arginine-dependent  nitric oxide  although the existence of animal nos homologs in plants is  ii  plasma membrane-bound  nitrate reductase   iii  mitochondrial electron transport chain  or  iv  non-enzymatic  reactions  it is a signaling molecule  acts mainly against oxidative stress and also plays a role in plant pathogen interactions  treating cut flowers and other plants with nitric oxide has been shown to lengthen the time before important biological reaction mechanisms of nitric oxide are s-nitrosation  of thiols  and nitrosylation of transition metal ions  s-nitrosation  involves the  reversible  conversion of thiol groups  including cysteine residues in proteins  to form s-nitrosothiols   rsnos   s-nitrosation  is a mechanism for dynamic  post-translational  regulation of most or all major classes of the second mechanism  nitrosylation  involves the binding of ·no to a transition metal ion like iron or copper  in this function  ·no is referred to as a nitrosyl ligand  typical cases involve the nitrosylation of heme proteins like cytochromes  thereby disabling the normal enzymatic activity of the enzyme  nitrosylated ferrous iron is particularly stable  as the binding of the nitrosyl ligand to ferrous iron  fe ii   is very strong  hemoglobin is a prominent example of a heme protein that may be modified by ·no by both pathways  ·no may attach directly to the heme in the nitrosylation reaction  and independently form s-nitrosothiols  by s-nitrosation  of the thiol are several mechanisms by which ·no has been demonstrated to affect the biology of living cells  these include oxidation of iron-containing  proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase and aconitase  activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase  adp ribosylation of proteins  protein sulfhydryl group nitrosylation  and iron regulatory factor ·no has been demonstrated to activate nf-κb  in peripheral blood mononuclear cells  an important transcription factor in inos gene expression in response to was found that ·no acts through the stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase  which is a heterodimeric enzyme with subsequent formation of cyclic-gmp.  cyclic-gmp  activates protein kinase g  which causes reuptake of ca2+  and the opening of calcium-activated  potassium channels  the fall in concentration of ca2+  ensures that the myosin light-chain  kinase  mlck  can no longer phosphorylate the myosin molecule  thereby stopping the crossbridge cycle and leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle oxide oxygen blends are used in critical care to promote capillary and pulmonary dilation to treat primary pulmonary hypertension in neonatal and post-meconium  aspiration related to birth defects  these are often a last-resort  gas mixture before the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  ecmo   nitric oxide therapy has the potential to significantly increase the quality of life and  in some cases  save the lives of infants at risk for pulmonary vascular primary use is in the form of nitroglycerin  either pill or liquid spray forms  which  as a prodrug  is denitrated and releases the active metabolite nitric oxide  no  as with all supplements of nitric oxide  the response is short-lived  because  as a normally produced internal physiologic control mechanism  increased concentrations lead to increased rates of clearance  which is the reason that the effectiveness of sustained use of nitroglycerin for vasodilation fades to none after hours to days in the united states  ongoing direct use of nitric oxide use is only approved for neonates  in the adult icu setting  inhaled ·no can improve hypoxemia in acute lung injury  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and severe pulmonary hypertension  although the effects are short-lived  and there are no studies demonstrating improved clinical outcomes  it is used on an individualized basis in icus as an adjunct to other definitive therapies for reversible causes of hypoxemic respiratory in the united states  nitric oxide is a gas available in concentrations of only 100  ppm and 800  ppm  overdosage with inhaled nitric oxide will be seen by elevations in methemoglobin and pulmonary toxicities associated with inspired ·no  elevated no may cause acute lung injury inhaled nitric oxide is contraindicated in the treatment of neonates known to be dependent on right-to-left  shunting of blood  this is as the nitric oxide decreases the pulmonary circulation s resistance by dilating pulmonary blood vessels  the increased pulmonary return increases pressure in the left atrium  causing closure of the foramen ovale and reducing the blood flow through the ductus arteriosus  closing these shunts can kill neonates with heart malformations that rely on the right-to-left  shunting of blood nitric oxide is also administered as salvage therapy in patients with acute right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary oxide is considered an antianginal drug  it causes vasodilation  which can help with ischemic pain  known as angina  by decreasing the cardiac workload  by dilating  expanding  the arteries  nitric oxide drugs lower arterial pressure and left ventricular filling vasodilation does not decrease the volume of blood the heart pumps  but rather it decreases the force the heart muscle must exert to pump the same volume of blood  nitroglycerin pills  taken sublingually  under the tongue   are used to prevent or treat acute chest pain  the nitroglycerin reacts with a sulfhydryl group  –sh  to produce nitric oxide  which eases the pain by causing vasodilation  there is a potential role for the use of nitric oxide in alleviating bladder contractile and recent evidence suggests that nitrates may be beneficial for treatment of angina due to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption both by decreasing preload and afterload and by some direct vasodilation of coronary are some associated complaints with utilization of nitric oxide in neonatal patients  some of them include dose errors associated with the delivery system  headaches associated with environmental exposure of nitric oxide in hospital staff  hypotension associated with acute withdrawal of the drug  hypoxemia associated with acute withdrawal of the drug  and pulmonary edema in patients with crest syndrome nitric oxide is a compound produced by many cells of the body  it relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase  activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic-guanosine  3’,5’-monophosphate,  which then leads to vasodilation  when inhaled  nitric oxide dilates the pulmonary vasculature and  because of efficient scavenging by hemoglobin  has minimal effect on the vasculature of the entire nitric oxide appears to increase the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (pao2)  by dilating pulmonary vessels in better-ventilated  areas of the lung  moving pulmonary blood flow away from lung segments with low ventilation perfusion  v q  ratios toward segments with normal or better oxide is absorbed systemically after inhalation  most of it moves across the pulmonary capillary bed where it combines with hemoglobin that is 60%  to 100%  oxygen-saturated.nitrate  has been identified as the predominant nitric oxide metabolite excreted in the urine  accounting for >70%  of the nitric oxide dose inhaled  nitrate is cleared from the plasma by the kidney at rates approaching the rate of glomerular filtration as a result of its broad antibacterial properties as well as high penetrability in cells  as of 2007  inhaled nitric oxide therapy was being studied as a potential therapeutic intervention in acute and chronic lung can be exposed to nitric oxide in the workplace by breathing it in  the occupational safety and health administration  osha  has set the legal limit  permissible exposure limit  for nitric oxide exposure in the workplace as 25  ppm (30  mg/m3)  over an 8-hour  workday  the national institute for occupational safety and health  niosh  has set a recommended exposure limit  rel  of 25  ppm (30  mg/m3)  over an 8-hour  workday  at levels of 100  ppm  nitric oxide is immediately dangerous to life and
