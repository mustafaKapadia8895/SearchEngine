 eyjafjallajökull -  wikipediaeyjafjallajökull  icelandic pronunciation   listen     english pronunciation  ei-ya-fyat-la-yer-kitle),  english island mountain is one of the smaller ice caps of iceland  north of skógar and west of mýrdalsjökull  the ice cap covers the caldera of a volcano with a summit elevation of 1,651  metres (5,417  ft   the volcano has erupted relatively frequently since the last glacial period  most recently in consists of a volcano completely covered by an ice cap  the ice cap covers an area of about 100  square kilometres (39  sq mi   feeding many outlet glaciers  the main outlet glaciers are to the north  gígjökull  flowing into lónið  and steinholtsjökull  flowing into in 1967  there was a massive landslide on the steinholtsjökull glacial tongue  on 16  january 1967  at 13:47:55  there was an explosion on the glacier  it can be timed because the seismometers at kirkjubæjarklaustur monitored the movement  when about 15,000,000  cubic metres (530,000,000  cubic feet  of material hit the glacier a massive amount of air  ice  and water began to move out from under the glacier into the lagoon at the foot of the mountain itself  a stratovolcano  stands 1,651  metres (5,417  ft  at its highest point  and has a crater 3–4  kilometres (1.9–2.5  mi  in diameter  open to the north  the crater rim has three main peaks  clockwise from the north-east):  guðnasteinn  1,500  metres (4,900  ft   hámundur  1,651  metres (5,417  ft   and goðasteinn  1,497  metres (4,911  ft   the south face of the mountain was once part of iceland s coastline  from which  over thousands of years  the sea has retreated some 5  kilometres (3  mi   the former coastline now consists of sheer cliffs with many waterfalls  of which the best known is skógafoss  in strong winds  the water of the smaller falls can even be blown up the mountain  the area between the mountain and the present coast is a relatively flat strand  2  to 5  km (1  to 3  miles  wide  called eyjafjöll the name means  glacier   or more properly here  ice cap   of the eyjafjöll  the word jökull  meaning glacier or ice cap  is a cognate with the middle english word ikel surviving in the -icle  of english icicle eyjafjöll is the name given to the southern side of the volcanic massif together with the small mountains which form the foot of the volcano the name eyjafjöll is made up of the words eyja  genitive plural of ey  meaning eyot or island   and the plural word fjöll  meaning fells or mountains  and together literally means   the mountains of the islands   the name probably refers to the close-by  archipelago of vestmannaeyjar the word fjalla is the genitive plural of fjöll  and so eyjafjalla is the genitive form of eyjafjöll and means   of the eyjafjöll   a literal part-by-part  translation of eyjafjallajökull would thus be  islands  mountains  ice cap  eyjafjallajökull is sometimes referred to by the numeronym stratovolcano  whose vents follow an east-west  trend  is composed of basalt to andesite lavas  most of its historical eruptions have been however  fissure vents occur on both  mainly the west  sides of the volcano is fed by a magma chamber under the mountain  which in turn derives from the tectonic divergence of the mid-atlantic  ridge  it is part of a chain of volcanoes stretching across iceland  its nearest active neighbours are katla  to the northeast  and eldfell  on heimaey  to the southwest  the volcano is thought to be related to katla geologically  in that eruptions of eyjafjallajökull have generally been followed by eruptions of katla eyjafjallajökull erupted in the years 920  and 1612.some  damage was caused by a minor eruption in notably  the ash released from the eruption contained a large fraction of fluoride  which in high doses may harm the bone structure of cattle  horses  sheep and humans  the eruption also caused some small and medium glacier runs and flooding in nearby rivers markarfljót and holtsá  the eruptive phase started on 19  and 20  december 1821  by a series of explosive eruptions and continued over the next several days  the sources describe heavy ash fall in the area around the volcano  especially to the south and that event the sequence of eruptions continued on a more subdued level until june 1822.from  the end of june until the beginning of august 1822,  another sequence of explosive eruptions followed  the eruption columns were shot to considerable heights  with ashfall in both the far north of the country  in eyjafjörður  and in the southwest  on the peninsula of seltjarnarnes near reykjavík the period from august to december 1822  seemed quieter  but farmers attributed the death of cattle and sheep in the eyjafjörður area to poisoning from this eruption  which modern analysis identifies as fluoride poisoning  some small glacier runs occurred in the river holtsá  a bigger one flooded the plains near the river markarfljót   the sources do not indicate the exact 1823,  some men went hiking up on eyjafjallajökull to inspect the craters  they discovered a fissure vent near the summit caldera a bit to the west of guðnasteinn in early 1823,  the nearby volcano katla under the mýrdalsjökull ice cap erupted and at the same time steam columns were seen on the summit of eyjafjallajökull the ash of eyjafjallajökull’s 1821  eruptions is to be found all over the south of iceland  it is dark grey in colour  small-grained  and intermediate rock containing about 28–40%  silicon dioxide on 26  february 2010,  unusual seismic activity along with rapid expansion of the earth s crust was registered by the meteorological institute of this gave geophysicists evidence that magma was pouring from underneath the crust into the magma chamber of the eyjafjallajökull volcano and that pressure stemming from the process caused the huge crustal displacement at þorvaldseyri in march 2010,  almost three thousand small earthquakes were detected near the volcano  all having a depth of 7–10  kilometres (4.3–6.2  the seismic activity continued to increase and from 3–5  march  close to 3,000  earthquakes were measured at the epicenter of the volcano the eruption is thought to have begun on 20  march 2010,  about 8  kilometres (5  mi  east of the top crater of the volcano  on fimmvörðuháls  the high neck between eyjafjallajökull and the neighbouring icecap  mýrdalsjökull  this first eruption  in the form of a fissure vent  did not occur under the glacier and was smaller in scale than had been expected by some geologists  the fissure opened on the north side of fimmvörðuháls  directly across the popular hiking trail between skógar  south of the pass  and þórsmörk  immediately to the north on 14  april 2010  eyjafjallajökull resumed erupting after a brief pause  this time from the top crater in the centre of the glacier  causing jökulhlaup  meltwater floods  to rush down the nearby rivers  and requiring 800  people to be this eruption was explosive  due to meltwater getting into the volcanic vent  it was estimated to be ten to twenty times larger than the previous one in fimmvörðuháls  this second eruption threw volcanic ash several kilometres up in the atmosphere  which led to air travel disruption in northwest europe for six days from 15  april to 21  april 2010  and again  in may needed  including the closure of airspace over many parts of the eruptions also created electrical on 23  may 2010,  the london volcanic ash advisory centre declared the eruption to have stopped  but stated that they were continuing to monitor the the volcano continued to have several earthquakes daily  with volcanologists watching the volcano as of august 2010,  eyjafjallajökull was considered lies 25  km (16  mi  west of another subglacial volcano  katla  under the mýrdalsjökull ice cap  which is much more active and known for its powerful subglacial eruptions and its large magma each of the eruptions of eyjafjallajökull in 920,  1612,  and 1821–1823  has preceded an eruption of katla did not display any unusual activity  such as expansion of the crust or seismic activity  during the 2010  eruptions of eyjafjallajökull  though geologists have been concerned about the general instability of katla since 1999.  some geophysicists in iceland believe that the eyjafjallajökull eruption may trigger an eruption of katla  which would cause major flooding due to melting of glacial ice and send up massive plumes of on 20  april 2010,  icelandic president ólafur grímsson said  the time for katla to erupt is coming close   we have prepared   it is high time for european governments and airline authorities all over the world to start planning for the eventual katla continue to monitor katla  aware that any eruption from katla following an eruption from eyjafjallajökull has historically occurred within months of an eyjafjallajökull eruption  the icelandic meteorological office updates its website with reports of quakes at both eyjafjallajökull and on 8  july 2011  there was a jökulhlaup that destroyed a bridge on the ring road and caused cracks to appear on katla s may drove a toyota hilux up the volcano in a 2010  episode of the television show top gear  he reached the summit mere hours before the eruption happened  although may and the camera crew had left the volcano by the time the eruption started eyjafjallajökull was featured in the 2013  version of the movie  the secret life of walter mitty eyjafjallajökull is featured as one of the natural wonders in the computer game civilization vi eyjafjallajökull was featured in a lyric  performed by mf doom  in jj doom s song guv nor off of the album key to the kuffs released in 2012.
