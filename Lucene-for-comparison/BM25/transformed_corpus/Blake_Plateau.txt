 blake plateau -  wikipediathe blake plateau lies in the western atlantic ocean off the southeastern united states coasts of north carolina  south carolina  georgia and florida  the blake plateau lies between the north american continental shelf and the deep ocean basin extending about 145  kilometers (90  miles  east and west by 170  kilometers (106  miles  north and south  with a depth of about 500  meters (1,640  feet  inshore sloping to about 1,000  meters (3,281  feet  about 375  kilometers (233  miles  off shore  where the blake escarpment drops steeply to the deep the blake plateau  associated blake ridge and blake basin are named for the u s  coast and geodetic survey steamer george s  blake  in service that first used steel cable for oceanographic operations and pioneered deep ocean and gulf stream survey lines of the steamer blake first defined the plateau that now bears the ship s july 1880  blake under the command of commander john r  bartlett  1]  u s n   was working with sounding gear designed by lieutenant commander sigsbee in cooperation with alexander agassiz collecting biological samples and examining the gulf stream running eastward from cape romain when  in taking frequent soundings eastward   depths on this line were unexpectedly small  the axis of the gulf stream being crossed before a depth of three hundred fathoms (1,800  feet/549  meters  was found  with a bottom of  hard coral  and little this was early indication of the plateau that would in the future carry the ship s name  in 1882  commander bartlett described the plateau instead of a deep channel in the course of the stream as reported by lieutenants maffit and craven  and published in the coast survey reports  our later soundings show an extensive and nearly level plateau  extending from a point to the eastward of the little bahama banks to cape hatteras—off cape canaveral nearly 200  miles wide  and gradually contracting in width to the northward until reaching hatteras  where the depth is more than 1000  fathoms within thirty miles of shore  this plateau has a general depth of 400  fathoms  suddenly dropping off on its eastern edge to over 2000  reported the scouring effect of the current on the plateau  noting that on each side of the current the sounding cylinder  a device for sampling the nature of the bottom with the sounding  brought up ooze  within the current the  bottom was washed nearly bare   with particles being small and broken pieces of coral rock and so hard the sharp edge of the brass cylinder was to unusual features of the plateau  particularly scouring by the florida current and the antilles current that merge over the plateau to form the gulf mineral deposits  particularly manganese nodules  have long been of methane and other gas hydrates are also found on the blake plateau  although described as a  bleak  current-swept  plain   has biological communities including lophelia pertusa reefs that support as well as communities supported by gas commercial fishermen have begun exploiting deep sea fish on the plateau with studies being undertaken on the viability as these fish  although large  grow biological sampling of the deep  hard bottom is difficult under the gulf stream with the consequence that the fauna is relatively poorly 31°n  79°w﻿    ﻿31°n  79°w﻿    31;  -79
