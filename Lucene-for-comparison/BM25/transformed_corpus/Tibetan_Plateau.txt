 tibetan plateau -  wikipediathe tibetan plateau  tibetan  བོད་ས་མཐོ།  wylie  bod sa mtho   also known in china as the qinghai–tibet or the qingzang  chinese  青藏高原  pinyin  qīngzàng gāoyuán  or himalayan plateau  is a vast elevated plateau in central and east covering most of the tibet autonomous region and qinghai in western china  as well as part of ladakh in jammu and kashmir  india  it stretches approximately 1,000  kilometres (620  mi  north to south and 2,500  kilometres (1,600  mi  east to west  with an average elevation exceeding 4,500  metres (14,800  ft   the tibetan plateau is sometimes called  the roof of the world  because it stands over 3  miles above sea level and is surrounded by imposing mountain ranges that harbor the world s two highest summits  mount everest and k2,  and is the world s highest and largest plateau  with an area of 2,500,000  square kilometres (970,000  sq mi   about five times the size of metropolitan sometimes termed the third pole  the tibetan plateau contains the headwaters of the drainage basins of most of the streams in surrounding regions  its tens of thousands of glaciers and other geographical and ecological features serve as a  water tower  storing water and maintaining flow  the impact of global warming on the tibetan plateau is of intense scientific tibetan plateau is surrounded by massive mountain the plateau is bordered to the south by the inner himalayan range  to the north by the kunlun mountains  which separate it from the tarim basin  and to the northeast by the qilian mountains  which separate the plateau from the hexi corridor and gobi desert  to the east and southeast the plateau gives way to the forested gorge and ridge geography of the mountainous headwaters of the salween  mekong  and yangtze rivers in northwest yunnan and western sichuan  the hengduan mountains   in the west the curve of the rugged karakoram range of northern kashmir embraces the plateau  the indus river originates in the western tibetan plateau in the vicinity of lake manasarovar the tibetan plateau is bounded in the north by a broad escarpment where the altitude drops from around 5,000  metres (16,000  ft  to 1,500  metres (4,900  ft  over a horizontal distance of less than 150  kilometres (93  mi   along the escarpment is a range of mountains  in the west the kunlun mountains separate the plateau from the tarim basin  about halfway across the tarim the bounding range becomes the altyn-tagh  and the kunluns  by convention  continue somewhat to the south  in the  v  formed by this split is the western part of the qaidam basin  the altyn-tagh  ends near the dangjin pass on the dunhuang-golmud  road  to the west are short ranges called the danghe  yema  shule  and tulai nanshans  the easternmost range is the qilian mountains  the line of mountains continues east of the plateau as the qinling  which separates the ordos plateau from sichuan  north of the mountains runs the gansu or hexi corridor which was the main silk-road  route from china proper to the west the plateau is a high-altitude  arid steppe interspersed with mountain ranges and large brackish lakes  annual precipitation ranges from 100  to 300  millimetres (3.9  to 11.8  in  and falls mainly as hail  the southern and eastern edges of the steppe have grasslands which can sustainably support populations of nomadic herdsmen  although frost occurs for six months of the year  permafrost occurs over extensive parts of the plateau  proceeding to the north and northwest  the plateau becomes progressively higher  colder and drier  until reaching the remote changtang region in the northwestern part of the plateau  here the average altitude exceeds 5,000  metres (16,000  ft  and winter temperatures can drop to −40  °c (−40  °f   as a result of this extremely inhospitable environment  the changthang region  together with the adjoining kekexili region  is the least populous region in asia  and the third least populous area in the world after antarctica and northern greenland the geological history of the tibetan plateau is closely related to that of the himalayas  the himalayas are among the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consist mostly of uplifted sedimentary and metamorphic rock  their formation is a result of a continental collision or orogeny along the convergent boundary between the indo-australian  plate and the eurasian plate the collision began in the upper cretaceous period about 70  million years ago  when the north-moving  indo-australian  plate  moving at about 15  cm (6  in  per year  collided with the eurasian plate  about 50  million years ago  this fast moving indo-australian  plate had completely closed the tethys ocean  the existence of which has been determined by sedimentary rocks settled on the ocean floor  and the volcanoes that fringed its edges  since these sediments were light  they crumpled into mountain ranges rather than sinking to the floor  the indo-australian  plate continues to be driven horizontally below the tibetan plateau  which forces the plateau to move upwards  the plateau is still rising at a rate of approximately 5  mm (0.2  in  per year much of the tibetan plateau is of relatively low relief  the cause of this is debated among geologists  some argue that the tibetan plateau is an uplifted peneplain formed at low altitude  while others argue that the low relief stems from erosion and infill of topographic depressions that occurred at already high tibetan plateau supports a variety of ecosystems  most of them classified as montane grasslands  while parts of the plateau feature an alpine tundra-like  environment  other areas feature monsoon-influenced  shrublands and forests  species diversity is generally reduced on the plateau due to the elevation of low precipitation  the tibetan plateau hosts species of gray wolf  snow leopard  wild yak  wild donkey  cranes  vultures  hawks  geese  snakes  and water buffalo  one notable animal is the high-altitude  jumping spider  that can live at elevations of over 6,500  metres (21,300  found on the tibetan plateau  as defined by the world wide fund for nature  are as follows nomads on the tibetan plateau and in the himalayas are the remainders of nomadic practices historically once widespread in asia and pastoral nomads constitute about 40%  of the ethnic tibetan the presence of nomadic peoples on the plateau is predicated on their adaptation to survival on the world s grassland by raising livestock rather than crops  which are unsuitable to the terrain  archaeological evidence suggests that the colonization leading to the full-time  occupation of the plateau occurred much later than the previously thought 30,000  years since colonization of the tibetan plateau  tibetan culture has adapted and flourished in the western  southern  and eastern regions of the plateau  the northern portion  the changtang  is generally too high and cold to support permanent one of the most notable civilizations to have developed on the tibetan plateau is the tibetan empire from the 7th  century to the 9th  century ad monsoons are caused by the different amplitudes of surface temperature seasonal cycles between land and oceans  this differential warming happens because heating rates differ between land and water  ocean heating is distributed vertically through a  mixed layer  that may be fifty meters deep through the action of wind and buoyancy-generated  turbulence  whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly  with the seasonal signal penetrating only a meter or so  additionally  the specific heat capacity of liquid water is significantly greater than that of most materials that make up land  together  these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land  with the consequence that the land warms and cools faster than the ocean  in turn  air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than does air over the the warmer air over land tends to rise  creating an area of low pressure  the pressure anomaly then causes a steady wind to blow toward the land  which brings the moist air over the ocean surface with it  rainfall is then increased by the presence of the moist ocean air  the rainfall is stimulated by a variety of mechanisms  such as low-level  air being lifted upwards by mountains  surface heating  convergence at the surface  divergence aloft  or from storm-produced  outflows near the surface  when such lifting occurs  the air cools due expansion in lower pressure  which in turn produces condensation and precipitation in winter  the land cools off quickly  but the ocean maintains the heat longer  the hot air over the ocean rises  creating a low-pressure  area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land  increased by wintertime monsoons are similar to sea and land breezes  a term usually referring to the localized  diurnal cycle of circulation near coastlines everywhere  but they are much larger in scale  stronger and the seasonal monsoon wind shift and weather associated with the heating and cooling of the tibetan plateau is the strongest such monsoon on earth today  tibet is an important heating surface of the atmosphere  however  during the last glacial maximum  an approximately 2,400,000  square kilometres (930,000  sq mi  ice sheet covered the due to its great extent  this glaciation in the subtropics was an important element of radiative forcing  with a much lower latitude  the ice in tibet reflected at least four times more radiation energy per unit area into space than ice at higher latitudes  thus  while the modern plateau heats the overlying atmosphere  during the last ice age it helped to cool cooling had multiple effects on regional climate  without the thermal low pressure caused by the heating  there was no monsoon over the indian subcontinent  this lack of monsoon caused extensive rainfall over the sahara  expansion of the thar desert  more dust deposited into the arabian sea  and a lowering of the biotic life zones on the indian subcontinent  animals responded to this shift in climate  with the javan rusa migrating into addition  the glaciers in tibet created meltwater lakes in the qaidam basin  the tarim basin  and the gobi desert  despite the strong evaporation caused by the low latitude  silt and clay from the glaciers accumulated in these lakes  when the lakes dried at the end of the ice age  the silt and clay were blown by the downslope wind off the plateau  these airborne fine grains produced the enormous amount of loess in the chinese tibetan plateau contains the world s third-largest  store of ice  qin dahe  the former head of the china meteorological administration  issued the following assessment in 2009:temperatures  are rising four times faster than elsewhere in china  and the tibetan glaciers are retreating at a higher speed than in any other part of the world  in the short term  this will cause lakes to expand and bring floods and mudflows  in the long run  the glaciers are vital lifelines for asian rivers  including the indus and the ganges  once they vanish  water supplies in those regions will be in
