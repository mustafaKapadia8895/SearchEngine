 northeastern united states -  wikipediathe northeastern united states  also referred to as the american northeast or simply the northeast  is a geographical region of the united states bordered to the north by canada  to the east by the atlantic ocean  to the south by the southern united states  and to the west by the midwestern united states  the northeast is one of the four regions defined by the united states census bureau for the collection and analysis of the census bureau-defined  region has a total area of 181,324  sq mi (469,630  km2)  with 162,257  sq mi (420,240  km2)  of that being land although it lacks a unified cultural identity  the northeastern region is the nation s most economically developed  densely populated  and culturally diverse of the nation s four census regions  the northeast is the second most urban  with 85  percent of its population residing in urban areas  led by the west with 90  census bureau has defined the northeast region as comprising nine states  from northeast to southwest  they are maine  new york  new jersey  vermont  massachusetts  rhode island  connecticut  new hampshire  and the region is subdivided into new england  the six states east of new york  and the mid-atlantic  states  new york  new jersey  and pennsylvania  this definition has been essentially unchanged since 1880  and is widely used as a standard for data the census bureau has acknowledged the limitations of this and the potential merits of a proposal created after the 1950  census that would include changing regional boundaries to include delaware  maryland  and washington  d c  with the mid-atlantic  states  but ultimately decided that  the new system did not win enough overall acceptance among data users to warrant adoption as an official new set of general-purpose  state groupings  the previous development of many series of statistics  arranged and issued over long periods of time on the basis of the existing state groupings  favored the retention of the summary units of the current regions and the census bureau confirmed in 1994  that it would continue to  review the components of the regions and divisions to ensure that they continue to represent the most useful combinations of states and state organizations and reference works follow the census bureau s definition for the however  other entities define the northeastern united states in significantly different ways for various purposes  the association of american geographers divides the northeast into two divisions-   new england   which consists of maine  vermont  new hampshire  massachusetts  rhode island and connecticut  and the  middle states   which consists of new york  pennsylvania  new jersey  and similarly  the geological society of america defines the northeast as these same states but with the addition of maryland and the district of the narrowest definitions include only the states of new other more restrictive definitions include new england and new york as part of the northeast united states  but exclude pennsylvania and new states beyond the census bureau definition that other entities include in the northeast united states are anthropologists recognize the  northeastern woodlands  as one of the cultural regions that existed in the western hemisphere at the time of european colonists in the 15th  and later centuries  most did not settle in north america until the 17th  century  the cultural area  known as the  northeastern woodlands   in addition to covering the entire northeast u s   also covered much of what is now canada and others regions of what is now the eastern united among the many tribes that inhabited this area were those that made up the iroquois nations and the numerous algonquian in the united states of the 21st  century  18  federally recognized tribes reside in the for the most part  the people of the northeastern woodlands  on whose lands european fishermen began camping to dry their codfish in the early 1600s,  lived in villages  especially after being influenced by the agricultural traditions of the ohio and mississippi valley of the states making up the northeastern region were among the original thirteen colonies  though maine  vermont  and delaware were part of other colonies before the united states became independent in the american revolution  the two cultural and geographic regions that form parts of the northeastern region have distinct histories the first europeans to settle new england were pilgrims from england  who landed in present-day  massachusetts in the pilgrims arrived by the mayflower ship and founded plymouth colony so they could practice religion ten years later  a larger group of puritans settled north of plymouth colony in boston to form massachusetts bay in 1636,  colonists established connecticut colony and providence providence was founded by roger williams  who was banished by massachusetts for his beliefs in freedom of religion  and it was the first colony to guarantee all citizens freedom of anne hutchinson  who was also banished by massachusetts  formed the town of providence  portsmouth  and two other towns  newport and warwick  consolidated to form the colony of rhode island and providence the first settlers of new england were motivated by religion  in more recent history  new england has become one of the least religious parts of the united states  in a 2009  gallup survey  less than half of residents in vermont  new hampshire  maine  and massachusetts reported religion as an important part of their daily in

colony in 1681,  william penn  who wanted to give quakers a land of religious freedom  founded pennsylvania and extended freedom of religion to all strongly desired access to the sea for his pennsylvania province and leased what then came to be known as the  lower counties on the from the duke penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one general assembly in 1682.  however  by 1704  the province of pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the lower counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own  one at philadelphia  and the other at new castle  penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person governor
