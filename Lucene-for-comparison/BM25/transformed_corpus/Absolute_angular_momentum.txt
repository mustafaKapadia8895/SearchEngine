 absolute angular momentum -  wikipediain meteorology  absolute angular momentum refers to the angular momentum in an  absolute  coordinate system  absolute time and space  angular momentum l equates with the cross product of the position  vector  r of a particle  or fluid parcel  and its absolute linear momentum p  equal to mv  the product of mass and velocity  mathematically absolute angular momentum sums the angular momentum of a particle or fluid parcel in a relative coordinate system and the angular momentum of that relative coordinate system meteorologists typically express the three vector components of velocity v    u  v  w   eastward  northward  and upward   the magnitude of the absolute angular momentum l per unit mass mwherethe first term represents the angular momentum of the parcel with respect to the surface of the earth  which depends strongly on weather  the second term represents the angular momentum of the earth itself at a particular latitude  essentially constant at least on non-geological  timescales  in the shallow troposphere of the earth  one can approximate r≈a  the distance between the fluid parcel and the center of the earth approximately equal to the mean earth radius whereat the north pole and south pole  latitude φ=±90°=π/2rad),  no absolute angular momentum can exist (m=0  m2/s  because cos(±90°)=0).  if a fluid parcel with no eastward wind speed (u0=0m/s)  originating at the equator (φ=0  rad so cos φ   cos(0  rad    1)  conserves its angular momentum (m0   m  as it moves poleward  then its eastward wind speed increases dramatically  u0  a cos(φ0)    ω a2  cos2(φ0)    u a cos φ    ω a2  cos2(φ).  after those substitutions  ω a2    u a cos φ    ω a2  cos2(φ),  or after further simplification  ω a(1-cos2(φ))    u cos φ   solution for u gives ω a(1/cos(φ)  -  cos φ     u  if φ   15°  (cos(φ)=1+√3/2√2),  then 72.921150  × 10−6  rad s × 6.371009  mm ×(2√2/1+√3  -  1+√3/2√2)  ≈ 32.2m/s  ≈ u the zonal pressure gradient and eddy stresses cause torque that changes the absolute angular momentum of fluid parcels holton  james r   hakim  gregory j  (2012),  an introduction to dynamic meteorology  5,  waltham  massachusetts  academic press  pp  342–343,  isbn 978-0-12-384866-6
