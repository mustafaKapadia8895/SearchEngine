 wide field and planetary camera 2  -  wikipediathe wide field and planetary camera 2  (wfpc2)  is a camera formerly installed on the hubble space telescope  the camera was built by the jet propulsion laboratory and is roughly the size of a baby grand piano  it was installed by servicing mission 1  (sts-61)  in 1993,  replacing the telescope s original wide field and planetary camera  wf pc   wfpc2  was used to image the hubble deep field in 1995,  the hourglass nebula and egg nebula in 1996,  and the hubble deep field south in 1998.  during sts-125,  wfpc2  was removed and replaced with the wide field camera 3  as part of the mission s first spacewalk on may 14,  2009.  after returning to earth  the camera was displayed briefly at the national air and space museum and the jet propulsion laboratory before returning to its final home at the smithsonian s national air and space was built by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory  which also built the predecessor wf pc camera launched with hubble in 1990.  wfpc2  contains internal corrective optics to fix the spherical aberration in the hubble telescope s primary mirror the charge-coupled  devices  ccds  in the wfpc2   designed at jpl and manufactured by loral  detected electromagnetic radiation in a range from 120  nm to 1000  nm  this included the 380  nm to 780  nm of the visible spectrum  all of the near ultraviolet  and a small part of the extreme ultraviolet band  and most of the near infrared band  the sensitivity distribution of these ccds is roughly normal  with a peak around 700  nm and concomitantly very poor sensitivity at the extremes of the ccds  operating range  wfpc2  featured four identical ccd detectors  each 800x800  pixels  three of these  arranged in an l-formation,  comprise hubble s wide field camera  wfc   adjacent to them is the planetary camera  pc   a fourth ccd with different (narrower-focused)  optics  this afforded a more detailed view over a smaller region of the visual field  wfc and pc images are typically combined  producing the wfpc2's  characteristic stairstep image  when distributed as non-scientific  jpeg files the pc portion of the image is shown with the same resolution as the wfc portions  but astronomers receive a raw scientific image package which presents the pc image in its native  higher detail to allow scientists to view specific parts of the electromagnetic spectrum the wfpc2  featured a rotating wheel which moves different optical filters into the lightpath  between the wfpc2's  aperture and the ccd detectors   the 48  filter elements included as predicted  over the course of its mission the wfpc2  experienced degradation of the ccds  resulting in defective   hot   pixels  the telescope s operators perform monthly calibration tests to catalog these  with the wfpc s aperture closed a number of long exposures are taken  and pixels which differ significantly from near black are flagged  to avoid false positives caused by cosmic rays tripping a given pixel  the output of different calibration shots are compared  pixels which are consistently  hot  are recorded  and astronomers who analyse raw wfpc2  images receive a list of these pixels  typically astronomers adjust their photo-processing  software to ignore these bad pixels.wfpc2  was largely superseded for broad-band  imaging by the advanced camera for surveys  installed during servicing mission 3b  in 2002.  however  the early 2007  failure of acs resulted in wfpc2  returning to its role as hubble s primary visible light camera  wfpc2  was removed from hst during servicing mission 4  in may 2009,  for return to earth and eventual museum display  it was replaced by wide field camera 3,  which features two uv visible detecting ccds  each 2048x4096  pixels  and a separate ir ccd of 1024  x 1024,  capable of receiving infrared radiation up to 1700  nm hubble space telescope wfpc2  image of the hubble deep field showing the characteristic stairstep composition of wfpc2  imagespillars within eagle nebulawfpc 2  image in 1994  of m100   ngc 4321)ngc  604  in the triangulum galaxybok globulespart of omega centauriegg nebula
