 thundersnow -  wikipediathundersnow  also known as a winter thunderstorm or a thundersnowstorm  is an kind of thunderstorm with snow falling as the primary precipitation instead of rain  it typically falls in regions of strong upward motion within the cold sector of an extratropical cyclone  thermodynamically  it is not different from any other type of thunderstorm  but the top of the cumulonimbus cloud is usually quite low  in addition to snow  graupel  or hail may fall thundersnow  while relatively rare anywhere  is more common with lake-effect  snow in the great lakes area of the united states and canada  the midwestern united states  and the great salt lake  thundersnow also occurs in halifax  nova scotia  sometimes several times per winter season  bozeman  montana also sees thundersnow more often than average with these storms typically occurring in april or may  in the united states  march is the peak month of formation  on average  only 6.4  events are reported per british isles and other parts of northwestern europe occasionally report thunder and lightning during sleet or  usually wet  snow showers during winter and spring  it is also common around kanazawa and the sea of japan  and even around mount everest  low pressure events in the eastern mediterranean that originate from polar origin cause copious thundersnow occurrences during winter storms  especially over the elevated provinces of israel and jordan  including amman and jerusalem  when such storms happen at areas intended for skiing  the mountains are often evacuated for safety one unique aspect of thundersnow is that the suspended and deposited snowfall act as an acoustic suppressor of the sound of thunder  the thunder from a typical thunderstorm can be heard many miles away  while the thunder from thundersnow can usually only be heard within a 2–3-mile  (3.2–4.8  km  radius from the needed there are usually three causes of thundersnow lake effect thundersnow occurs after a cold front or shortwave aloft passes over a body of water  this steepens the thermal lapse rates between the lake temperature and the temperatures aloft  a difference in temperature of 25  °c (45  °f  or more between the lake temperature and the temperature at about 1,500  m (4,900  ft   the 850  hpa level  usually marks the onset of thundersnow  if surface temperatures are expected to be below freezing  however several factors  including other geographical elements  affect the development of thundersnow the primary factor is convective depth  this is the vertical depth in the troposphere that a parcel of air will rise from the ground before it reaches the equilibrium  eql  level and stops rising  a minimum depth of 1,500  m (4,900  ft  is necessary  and an average depth of 3,000  m (9,800  ft  or more is generally accepted as sufficient  wind shear is also a significant factor  linear snow squall bands produce more thundersnow than clustered bands  thus a directional wind shear with a change of less than 12  °c (54  °f  between the ground and 2,000  m (6,600  ft  in height must be in place  however  any change in direction greater than 12  °c (54  °f  through that layer will tear the snow squall apart  a bare minimum fetch of 50  km h (31  mph  is required so that the air passing over the lake or ocean water will become sufficiently saturated with moisture and will acquire thermal energy from the water the last component is the echo top or storm top temperature  this must be at least −30  °c (−22  °f   it is generally accepted that at this temperature there is no longer any super cooled water vapor present in a cloud  but just ice crystals suspended in the air  this allows for the interaction of the ice cloud and graupel pellets within the storm to generate a charge  resulting in lightning and snow storms tend to be large and complex  with many possible factors affecting the development of thundersnow  the best location in a storm to find thundersnow is typically in its northwest quadrant  in the northern hemisphere  based on observations in the midwestern united states   within what is known as the  comma head  of a mature extratropical thundersnow can also be located underneath the trowal  a trough of warm air aloft which shows up in a surface weather analysis as an inverted trough extending backward into the cold sector from the main in extreme cases  thunderstorms along the cold front are transported towards the center of the low pressure system and will have their precipitation change to snow or ice  once the cold front becomes a portion of the occluded the 1991  halloween blizzard  superstorm of 1993,  and white juan are examples of such blizzards featuring thundersnow similar to the lake effect regime  thundersnow is usually witnessed in terrain in the cold sector of an extratropical cyclone when a shortwave aloft moves into the region  the shortwave will steepen the local lapse rates  allowing for a greater possibility of both heavy snow at elevations where it is near or below freezing  and occasionally produces heavy snowfall rates in the range of 5  to 10  cm (2  to 4  in  per hour  snowfall of this intensity may limit visibilities severely  even during light wind conditions  however  thundersnow is often a part of a severe winter storm or blizzard  winds of above tropical storm force are frequent with thundersnow  as a result  visibilities in thundersnow are frequently under 400  m (1⁄4  mi   additionally  such wind creates extreme wind chills and may result in frostbite  finally  there is a greater likelihood that thundersnow lightning will have a positive polarity which has greater destructive potential than negatively charged  typical
