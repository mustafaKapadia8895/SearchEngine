 clovis culture -  wikipediathe clovis culture is a prehistoric paleo-indian  culture  named for distinct stone tools found in close association with pleistocene fauna at blackwater locality no  1  near clovis  new mexico  in the 1920s  and 1930s.  the clovis culture appears around 11,500–11,000  uncal  uncalibrated radiocarbon years before present   at the end of the last glacial period  and is characterized by the manufacture of  clovis points  and distinctive bone and ivory tools  archaeologists  most precise determinations at present suggest that this radiocarbon age is equal to roughly 13,200  to 12,900  calendar years ago  clovis people are considered to be the ancestors of most of the indigenous cultures of the only human burial that has been directly associated with tools from the clovis culture included the remains of an infant boy named researchers from the united states and europe conducted paleogenetic research on anzick-1's  ancient nuclear  mitochondrial  and y-chromosome  the results of these analyses reveal that anzick-1  is closely related to modern native american populations  which lends support to the beringia hypothesis for the peopling of the clovis culture was replaced by several more localized regional cultures from the time of the younger dryas cold climate period onward  post-clovis  cultures include the folsom tradition  gainey  suwannee-simpson,  plainview-goshen,  cumberland  and redstone  each of these is commonly thought to derive directly from clovis  in some cases apparently differing only in the length of the fluting on their projectile points  although this is generally held to be the result of normal cultural change through numerous other reasons have been suggested to be the driving force for the observed changes in the archaeological record  such as the younger dryas post-glacial  climate change which exhibited numerous faunal extinctions after the discovery of several clovis sites in eastern north america in the 1930s,  the clovis people came to be regarded as the first human inhabitants who created a widespread culture in the new world  however  this theory has been challenged  in the opinion of many archaeologists  by several archaeological discoveries  including sites such as cactus hill in virginia  paisley caves in the summer lake basin of oregon  the topper site in allendale county  south carolina  meadowcroft rockshelter in pennsylvania  the site in texas  cueva fell in chile and  especially  monte verde  also in the claim to the oldest human archaeological site known in the americas belongs to the pedra furada human remains and hearths  a site in brazil that precedes the clovis culture and the other sites already mentioned by 19,000  to 30,000  years  this discovery has become an issue of contention between north american archaeologists and their south american and european counterparts  who disagree on whether it is conclusively proven to be hallmark of the toolkit associated with the clovis culture is the distinctively shaped  fluted stone spear point  known as the clovis point  the clovis point is bifacial and typically fluted on both sides  archaeologists do not agree on whether the widespread presence of these artifacts indicates the proliferation of a single people  or the adoption of a superior technology by diverse population culture was originally named for a small number of artifacts found between 1932  and 1936  at blackwater locality no  1,  an archaeological site between the towns of clovis and portales  new mexico  these finds were deemed especially important due to their direct association with mammoth sp  and the extinct bison antiquus  the in situ finds of 1936  and 1937  included most of four stone clovis points  two long bone points with impact damage  stone blades  a portion of a clovis blade core  and several cutting tools made on stone clovis sites have since been identified throughout much  but not all  of the contiguous united states  as well as mexico and central america  and even into northern south is generally accepted that clovis people hunted mammoths  as clovis points have repeatedly been found in sites containing mammoth remains  however  mammoth was only a small part of the clovis diet  extinct bison  mastodon  gomphotheres  sloths  tapir  camelops  horse and a host of smaller animals have also been found at clovis sites where they were killed and eaten  in total  more than 125  species of plants and animals are known to have been used by clovis people in the portion of the western hemisphere they oldest clovis site in north america is believed to be el fin del mundo in northwestern sonora  mexico  discovered during a 2007  survey  it features occupation dating around 13,390  calibrated years in 2011,  remains of gomphothere were found  the evidence suggests that humans did in fact kill two of them here  there s also the aubrey site in denton county  texas  which produced a radiocarbon date that is almost most commonly held perspective on the end of the clovis culture is that a decline in the availability of megafauna  combined with an overall increase in a less mobile population  led to local differentiation of lithic and cultural traditions across the after this time  clovis-style  fluted points were replaced by other fluted-point  traditions  such as the folsom culture  with an essentially uninterrupted sequence across north and central america  an effectively continuous cultural adaptation proceeds from the clovis period through the ensuing middle and late paleoindian the clovis culture drove the mammoth  and other species  to extinction via overhunting – the so-called  pleistocene overkill hypothesis – is still an open  and controversial  it has also been hypothesized that the clovis culture saw its decline in the wake of the younger dryas cold this  cold shock   lasting roughly 1500  years  affected many parts of the world  including north america  this appears to have been triggered by a vast amount of meltwater – possibly from lake agassiz – emptying into the north atlantic  disrupting the thermohaline younger dryas impact hypothesis or clovis comet hypothesis originally proposed that a large air burst or earth impact of a comet or comets from outer space initiated the younger dryas cold period about 12,900  bp calibrated (10,900  14c  uncalibrated  years the hypothesis has been largely contradicted by research showing that most of the conclusions cannot be repeated by other scientists  and criticized because of misinterpretation of data and the lack of confirmatory cowboy and former slave  george mcjunkin  found an ancient bison  bison antiquus  an extinct relative of the american bison  skeleton in 1908  after a flash the site was first excavated in 1926,  near folsom  new mexico  under the direction of harold cook and jesse figgins  on august 29,  1927,  they found the first in situ folsom point with the extinct b  antiquus bones  this confirmation of a human presence in the americas during the pleistocene inspired many people to start looking for evidence of early 1929,  19-year-old  ridgely whiteman  who had been closely following the excavations in nearby folsom in the newspaper  discovered the clovis site near the blackwater draw in eastern new mexico  despite several earlier paleoindian discoveries  the best documented evidence of the clovis complex was collected and excavated between 1932  and 1937  near clovis  new mexico  by a crew under the direction of edgar billings howard until 1935  and later by john cotter from the academy of natural sciences university of pennsylvania  howard s crew left their excavation in burnet cave  new mexico  the first truly professionally excavated clovis site  in august  1932,  and visited whiteman and his blackwater draw site  by november  howard was back at blackwater draw to investigate additional finds from a construction american journal of archaeology  january–march  1932  v36  #1)  in its  archaeological notes  mentions e  b  howard s work in burnet cave  including the discovery of extinct fauna and a  folsom type  point four feet below a basketmaker burial  this brief mention of the clovis point found in place predates any work at the dent site in colorado  reference is made to a slightly earlier article on burnet cave in the university museum bulletin of november  1931.the  first report of professional work at the blackwater draw clovis site is in the november 25,  1932,  issue of science news  the publications on burnet cave and blackwater draw directly contradict statements by several authors  for example see haynes 2002:56  the early settlement of north america  that dent  colorado was the first excavated clovis site  the dent site  in weld county  colorado  was simply a fossil mammoth excavation in 1932.  the first dent clovis point was found november 5,  1932  and the in situ point was found july 7,  1933.  the in situ clovis point from burnet cave was excavated in late august  1931   and reported early in 1932).  e  b  howard brought the burnet cave point to the 3rd  pecos conference  september 1931,  and showed it around to several archaeologists interested in early humans  see woodbury 1983).also,  in 1968,  in montana  a clovis burial site was found where the remains of a two-year-old  child were studied  these remains have been named as anzick-1  and recently  in 2014,  have been used in scientific genetic data shows that the clovis people are the direct ancestors of roughly 80%  of all living native american populations in north and south america  with the remainder descended from ancestors who entered in later waves of as reported in february 2014,  dna from the 12,600-year-old  remains of anzick boy  found in montana  has affirmed this connection to the peoples of the americas  in addition  this dna analysis affirmed genetic connections back to ancestral peoples of northeast asia  this adds weight to the theory that peoples migrated across a land bridge from siberia to north as  clovis first   the predominant hypothesis among archaeologists in the latter half of the 20th  century had been that the people associated with the clovis culture were the first inhabitants of the americas  the primary support for this was that no solid evidence of pre-clovis  human habitation had been found  according to the standard accepted theory  the clovis people crossed the beringia land bridge over the bering strait from siberia to alaska during the period of lowered sea levels during the ice age  then made their way southward through an ice-free  corridor east of the rocky mountains in present-day  western canada as the glaciers hypothesis came to be challenged by studies suggesting a pre-clovis  human occupation of the in 2011,  following the excavation of an occupation site at buttermilk creek  texas  a prominent group of scientists claimed to have definitely established the existence  of an occupation older than to researchers michael waters and thomas stafford of texas a m university  new radiocarbon dates place clovis remains from the continental united states in a shorter time window beginning 450  years later than the previously accepted threshold (13,200  to 12,900  the scientific consensus has changed to acknowledge the presence of pre-clovis  cultures in the americas  ending the  clovis first  results of a multiple-author  study by danish  canadian and american scientists published in nature in february 2016  revealed that  the first americans  whether clovis or earlier groups in unglaciated north america before 12.6  cal  kyr bp   are  unlikely  to  have travelled to north america from siberia via the bering land  via a corridor that opened up between the melting ice sheets in what is now alberta and b c  about 13,000  years ago  as many anthropologists have argued for the lead author  mikkel pedersen – a phd student from university of copenhagen – explained   the ice-free  corridor was long considered the principal entry route for the first americans     our results reveal that it simply opened up too late for that to have been the scientists argued that by 10,000  years ago  the ice-free  corridor in what is now alberta and b c  was gradually taken over by a boreal forest dominated by spruce and pine trees  and that  clovis people likely came from the south  not the north  perhaps following wild animals such as sites that predate clovis that are well documented include the following predecessors of the clovis people may have migrated south along the north american coastlines  although there are arguments for many migrations along several different radiocarbon dating of the monte verde site in chile place clovis-like  culture there as early as 18,500  to 14,500  years remains found at the channel islands of california place coastal paleoindians there 12,500  years ago  this suggests that the paleoindian migration could have spread more quickly along the pacific coastline  proceeding south  and that populations that settled along that route could have then begun migrations eastward into the continent the pedra furada sites in brazil include a collection of rock shelters  which were used for thousands of years by diverse human populations  the first excavations yielded artifacts with c14  dates of 48,000  to 32,000  years bp  repeated analysis has confirmed this dating  carrying the range of dates up to 60,000  the best-analyzed  archaeological levels are dated between 32,160  ± 1000  years bp and 17,000  ± 400  bp in 2004,  worked stone tools were found at topper in south carolina that have been dated by radiocarbon techniques possibly to 50,000  years but  there is significant scholarly dispute regarding these scholars agree that evidence of humans at the topper site date back to 22,900  cal yr more substantiated claim is that of paisley caves  oregon  where rigorous carbon-14  and genetic testing appears to indicate that humans related to modern native americans were present in the caves over 1000  14c  years before the earliest evidence of traces and tools made by another people  the  western stemmed  tradition  were study published in science presents strong evidence that humans occupied sites in monte verde  chile  at the tip of south america  as early as 13,000  years if this is true  then humans must have entered north america long before the clovis culture – perhaps 16,000  years ago the tlapacoya site in mexico is located along the base of a volcanic  remnant  hill on the shore of the former lake chalco  seventeen excavations along the base of tlapacoya hill between 1956  and 1973  uncovered piles of disarticulated bones of bear and deer that appeared to have been butchered  plus 2,500  flakes and blades presumably from the butchering activities  plus one non-fluted  spear point  all were found in the same stratum containing three circular hearths filled with charcoal and ash  bones of many other animal species were also present  including horses and migratory waterfowl  two uncalibrated radiocarbon dates on carbon from the hearths came in at approximately 24,000  and 22,000  years at another location a prismatic micro-blade  of obsidian was found in association with a tree trunk radiocarbon dated  uncalibrated  at approximately 24,000  years ago  this obsidian blade has recently been hydration dated by joaquín garcía-bárcena  to 22,000  years ago  the hydration results were published in a seminal article that deals with the evidence for pre-clovis  habitation of of the mitochondrial dna of first nations native americans published in 2007  suggest that the people of the new world may have diverged genetically from siberians as early as 20,000  years ago  far earlier than the standard theory according to one alternative theory  the pacific coast of north america may have been free of ice  allowing the first peoples in north america to come down this route prior to the formation of the ice-free  corridor in the continental no evidence has yet been found to support this needed  except that genetic analysis of coastal marine life indicates diverse fauna persisting in refugia throughout the pleistocene ice ages along the coasts of alaska and british columbia  these refugia include common food sources of coastal aboriginal peoples  suggesting that a migration along the coastline was feasible at the some early sites on the coast  for example namu  british columbia  exhibit maritime focus on foods from an early point with substantial cultural february 2014,  researchers reported on their dna analysis of the remains of anzick boy  referred to as anzick-1)  of montana  the oldest skeleton found in the americas and dated to 12,600  years ago  they found the mtdna to be d4h3a,   one of the rare lineages associated with native this was the same as the mtdna associated with current coastal populations in north and south america  the study team suggest that finding this genetic evidence so far inland shows that  current distribution of genetic markers are not necessarily indicative of the movement or distribution of peoples in the the y haplotype was found to be q-l54*(xm3).  further testing found that anzick-1  was most closely related to native american populations  see controversial solutrean hypothesis proposed in 1999  by smithsonian archaeologist dennis stanford and colleague bruce bradley  stanford and bradley 2002),  suggests that the clovis people could have inherited technology from the solutrean people who lived in southern europe 21,000–15,000  years ago  and who created the first stone age artwork in present-day  southern the link is suggested by the similarity in technology between the projectile points of the solutreans and those found at clovis  and pre-clovis)  sites  its proponents point to tools found at various pre-clovis  sites in eastern north america  particularly in the chesapeake bay region  as progenitors of clovis-style  the model envisions these people making the crossing in small watercraft via the edge of the pack ice in the north atlantic ocean that then extended to the atlantic coast of france  using skills similar to those of the modern inuit people  making landfall somewhere around the then-exposed  grand banks of the north american continental shelf in a 2008  study of the relevant paleoceanographic data  kieran westley and justin dix concluded that  it is clear from the paleoceanographic and paleo-environmental  data that the last glacial maximum  lgm  north atlantic does not fit the descriptions provided by the proponents of the solutrean atlantic hypothesis  although ice use and sea mammal hunting may have been important in other contexts  in this instance  the conditions militate against an ice-edge-following,  maritime-adapted  european population reaching the of new mexico anthropologist lawrence g  straus  a primary critic of the solutrean hypothesis  points to the theoretical difficulty of the ocean crossing  a lack of solutrean-specific  features in pre-clovis  artifacts  as well as the lack of art  such as that found at lascaux in france  among the clovis people  as major deficiencies in the solutrean hypothesis  the 3,000  to 5,000  radiocarbon year gap between the solutrean period of france and spain and the clovis of the new world also makes such a connection in response  bradley and stanford contend that it was  a very specific subset of the solutrean who formed the parent group that adapted to a maritime environment and eventually made it across the north atlantic ice-front  to colonize the east coast of the americas  and that this group may not have shared all solutrean cultural dna analysis in 2014  has found that members of some native north american tribes have a maternal ancestry  called haplogroup x  linked to the maternal ancestors of some present-day  individuals in western asia and europe  albeit distantly  this has also provided some support for pre-clovis  models  more specifically  a variant of mitochondrial dna called x2a  found in many native americans has been traced to western eurasia  while not being found in eastern dna analysis of anzick-1  concluded that the boy belonged to what is known as haplogroup or lineage d4h3a.  this finding is important because the d4h3a  line is considered to be a lineage  founder   belonging to the first people to reach the americas  although rare in most of today s native americans in the us and canada  d4h3a  genes are more common among native peoples of south america  far from the site in montana where anzick-1  was buried  this suggests a greater genetic complexity among native americans than previously thought  including an early divergence in the genetic lineage 13,000  years ago  one theory suggests that after crossing into north america from siberia  a group of the first americans  with the lineage d4h3a,  moved south along the pacific coast and  over thousands of years  into central and south america  while others may have moved inland  east of the rocky the apparent early divergence between north american and central plus south american populations may or may not be associated with post-divergence  gene flow from a more basal population into north america  however  analysis of published dna sequences for 19  siberian populations does not favor the latter and dna found at the paisley caves site in oregon suggest that north america was colonized by more than one culture  and that the clovis culture was not the first  there is evidence to suggest an east west dichotomy  with the clovis culture located to the in 2014,  the autosomal dna of a 12,500+-year-old  infant from montana was the dna was taken from a skeleton referred to as anzick-1,  found in close association with several clovis artifacts  comparisons showed strong affinities with dna from siberian sites  and virtually ruled out any close affinity with european sources  the  solutrean hypothesis    the dna also showed strong affinities with all existing native american populations  which indicated that all of them derive from an ancient population that lived in or near siberia  the upper palaeolithic mal ta population  mal ta belonged to y-dna  haplogroup r and mitochrondrial macrohaplogroup data indicate that anzick-1  is from a population directly ancestral to present south american and central american native american populations  this rules out hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the americas  anzick-1  is less closely related to present north american native american populations  including a yaqui genetic sample   suggesting that the north american populations are basal to anzick-1  and central and south american the apparent early divergence between north american and central plus south american populations may or may not be associated with post-divergence  gene flow from a more basal population into north america  however  analysis of published dna sequences for 19  siberian populations did not favor the latter the boy anzick-1,  which is 12,6  thousand years old on the territory of montana  belonged to y-haplogroup  q-l54  is by far the largest haplogroup among native americans in approximate reverse chronological order
