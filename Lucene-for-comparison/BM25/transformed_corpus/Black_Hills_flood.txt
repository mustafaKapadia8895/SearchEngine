 1972  black hills flood -  wikipediathe black hills flood of 1972,  also known as the rapid city flood  was the most detrimental flood in south dakota history  and the second most deadly flood in u s  it took place on june 9–10,  in the black hills of western south dakota  15  inches (380  mm  of rainfall over six hours sent rapid creek and other waterways overflowing  flooding many residential and commercial properties in rapid city  it also caused flooding of battle  spring  bear butte  and boxelder the night of june 9,  canyon lake dam became clogged with debris and failed  resulting in 238  deaths and 3,057  injuries  several bodies were never over 1,335  homes and 5,000  automobiles were destroyed  the value of the damaged property was over us $160  million in 1972  dollars a few days before the rapid city flood  “earlier rains had left the soil saturated  increasing the amount of runoff of the flood to on the afternoon of the 9th,  substantial rains fell on the area  caused by “an almost stationary group of  a strong low-level  easterly flow which forced the moist unstable air up-slope  on the hills  this sustained orographic effect helped the air to rise  cool  and release its moisture in repeating thunderstorms  another contributing factor was the unusually light winds at a higher atmospheric levels which did not disperse the moist air nor move the thunderstorms along to prevent an extreme concentration of to herbert thompson the air pattern causing this storm was noticed in big measure over the great plains  with a minor scale to the east of the rockies  there were only what appeared to be light winds  so nothing indicated that there was a huge storm underway  thompson further indicates that a cold high pressure region was pushed from canada into the great lakes region leading into the western part of south dakota  a “mesoscale cloud mass” from colorado also moved towards rapid one of the cloud masses amplified the “mid-level  moisture over rapid city ” while the other mass caused the pressure to stay  as the high pressure pushed downward  thus creating the right conditions to produce the rainfall from the upper “cloud mass” above the black hills formed into new smaller masses downwind which reprocessed the rain allowing for the constant the storm was described by nair  hjelmfelt  and pielke as “convective cells of high precipitation efficiency a characteristic of tropical precipitation cloud seeding experiments being conducted by the institute of atmospheric sciences on clouds west of rapid city were speculated to have contributed to the unusual amount of rain  however  there is no evidence that the two phenomena were immense precipitation was based over the “rapid  boxelder  spring  and battle creeks ” creating run-off,  along these creeks which led to flooding throughout the surrounding intense rain began on the afternoon of june 9  and continued until after midnight on june 10.  the immense amount of rain the black hills received during the thunderstorms ranged from 4  to 15  inches  causing rapid creek and surrounding creeks to overflow and creating massive amounts of runoff that resulted in flood waters  the run-off  carried rubble to the canyon lake dam creating a barrier in front of its this resulted in the “increase in depth of water behind the dam of 11  to 12  feet ” which caused the release of more water adding to the already moving the flash flood hit rapid city the hardest around midnight on june 9;  the flood waters also hit the small town keystone flood caused a tremendous amount of damage  flood waters displaced large rocks  trees  trailers  and vehicles  and carried homes in rapid city the flood resulted in the deaths of “238  including 5  missing ” 14  of the deaths were trained the flood resulted in over 3,000  people being injured  a total of 1,335  homes were ruined  and 2,820  homes were damaged  more than 200  businesses were ruined  and around 5,000  cars were demolished  the damage in rapid city totaled 66  million dollars in 1972  dollar as for keystone  “eight people were killed and much of the town was washed the damage in keystone totaled around $1.5  the total cost of the 1972  black hills flood totaled $165  million  including infrastructure and utilities  the total amount of rain the black hills received was “800,000  acre feet” equal to “1  billion metric tons of national weather service office  nws  in rapid city in 1972  was taking hourly surface observations  issuing local storm warnings and providing local forecasts to the media  the personnel in rapid city were not properly trained to make forecasts or use the technologies available to they lacked access to vital weather information to warn the area citizens the rapid city national weather service is now a forecast office with a full-time  staff of meteorologists who issue both forecasts and warnings for northeastern wyoming and the western third of south dakota  in 1972,  the national weather service office in rapid city did not have a teletype system to broadcast warnings  they instead used a one-way  telephone hotline to the media to broadcast the warnings  today warnings are sent to a regional site where they are sent to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa  weather wire system satellite  nws forecasters use the state radio system to notify 9-1-1  dispatchers and emergency personnel  this warning is also passed on to the emergency alert system  eas  in the aftermath of the 1972  flood  short-term  and long-term  programs were put into effect  many businesses were permitted to stay in the flood plain  but houses and motels were either raised or moved due to the likelihood that a flood would occur while a person may be sleeping  the majority of the flood plain was made into large parks  which have increased in number and have been improved and updated on a continuing basis  canyon lake dam and most bridges were redesigned to prevent debris clogs during flooding victims lost precious memories as stated in the rapid city newspaper  an excerpt from the newspaper reads  “operation family treasure’ may provide hope for people ’ for those who have given up all hope about finding a priceless photo album or sheet of important personal papers there may be a happy ending with “operation family treasure ” a clearing house for irreplaceable items run by the rapid city jaycees in conjunction with the office of civil defense  flood disaster victims advised on tax saw the 40  year anniversary of the fateful flood  survivors remarked on the horrific events  rita  who was 20  at the time  described the scene   there was so many in trees and screaming and crying and the sparks were flying from electric wires  houses were on fire  it was just — it was hell   she says  rita was seven months pregnant at the time of the tragedy  she describes her fears as   i wouldn t wish that upon nobody   she says   that s a nightmare and a half to think that you re going to die in water and your mom is gonna go with you and you re trying to do your best to keep your mom alive   rita and her mother were swept against a building and thankfully rescued  there were others with the same nightmares while others were worse  good samaritans  like alex were left to clean up the mess and search for the less fortunate  he describes a gruesome scene   i found a boy about 5  years old   alex says   he was dead  laying on some debris  i didn t touch him or nothing  i just went back and told the authorities where he was at  then i unidentified resident of rapid city  which was flooded  spoke to a reporter after the flood      the only thing above water is the hilltops  i guess it just     i guess we gotta couple troubles  another survivor said   my house is no more  you can see it over there  there s the  well  there just isn t anything  and another unidentified survivor added   a man knocked at our door and said   get out as fast as you can   we grabbed the children and my dad s crippled and we picked him up and put him in the car  and just as we drove out the driveway  a big trailer started floating right across the pathway  and we just made it up the hill and that was all it was  everything was source  sean potter  certified consulting meteorologist and certified broadcast meteorologist  wrote   i called my best advisor  mr  leonard swanson  the city public works director  and we met at city hall  heavy rains were falling  and mr  swanson and i drove to canyon lake park where a city worker and his family lived in the park caretaker s home  immediately below the dam  swanny ordered the caretaker  a parks department employee  to immediately take his family  leave their evening meal on the table and get out of the park  the entire family survived the flood  not a trace of the home  it was city property  or the contents was ever found  potter  sean
