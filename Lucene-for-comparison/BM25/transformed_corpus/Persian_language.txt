languages  particularly the turkic languages in central asia  caucasus  and anatolia  neighboring iranian languages  as well as armenian  georgian  and indo-aryan  languages  especially urdu  a register of hindustani   it also exerted some influence on arabic  particularly bahrani while borrowing much vocabulary from it after the arab conquest of a long history of literature in the form of middle persian before islam  persian was the first language in the muslim world to break through arabic s monopoly on writing  and the writing of poetry in persian was established as a court tradition

the place of origin of the language which is fars province is the arabicized form of in english  this language has historically been known as persian  though farsi has also gained some currency  farsi is encountered in some linguistic literature as a name for the language  used both by iranian and by foreign modern english the word farsi refers to the language while parsi  or parsee  describes zoroastrians  particularly in south asia the academy of persian language and literature has declared that the name persian is more appropriate  as it has the longer tradition in western languages and better expresses the role of the language as a mark of cultural and national some persian language scholars such as ehsan yarshater  editor of encyclopædia iranica  and university of arizona professor kamran talattof  have also rejected the usage of  farsi  in their international language-encoding  standard iso 639-1  uses the code fa  as its coding system is mostly based on the local names  the

language belonging to the indo-iranian  branch of the indo-european  family of languages  in general  iranian languages are known from three periods  usually referred to as old  middle  and new  modern  periods  these correspond to three eras in iranian history  old era being the period from sometime before achaemenids  the achaemenid era and sometime after achaemenids  that is to 400–300  bc   middle era being the next period most officially sassanid era and sometime in post-sassanid  era  and the new era being the period afterwards down to present to available documents  the persian language is  the only iranian for which close philological relationships between all of its three stages are established and so that old  middle  and new persian one and the same language of persian  that is  new persian is a direct descendant of middle and old known history of the persian language can be divided into the following three distinct periods as a written language  old persian is attested in royal achaemenid inscriptions  the oldest known text written in old persian is from the behistun examples of old persian have been found in what is now iran  romania armenia  bahrain  iraq  turkey and old persian is one of the oldest indo-european  languages which is attested in original a greek general serving in some of the persian expeditions  describes many aspects of armenian village life and hospitality in around 401  bc  which is at a time when old persian was the only form of persian used  he relates that the armenians spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the complex grammatical conjugation and declension of old persian yielded to the structure of middle persian in which the dual number disappeared  leaving only singular and plural  as did gender  middle persian developed the ezāfe construction  expressed through ī  modern ye   to indicate some of the relations between words that have been lost with the simplification of the earlier grammatical system although the  middle period  of the iranian languages formally begins with the fall of the achaemenid empire  the transition from old to middle persian had probably already begun before the 4th  century  however  middle persian is not actually attested until 600  years later when it appears in the sassanid era (224–651)  inscriptions  so any form of the language before this date cannot be described with any degree of certainty  moreover  as a literary language  middle persian is not attested until much later  to the 6th  or 7th  century  and from the 8th  century onward  middle persian gradually began yielding to new persian  with the middle-period  form only continuing in the texts of zoroastrianism the native name of middle persian was parsig or parsik  after the name of the ethnic group of the southwest  that is   of pars   old persian parsa  new persian fars  this is the origin of the name farsi as it is today used to signify new persian  following the collapse of the sassanid state  parsik came to be applied exclusively to  either middle or new  persian that was written in the arabic script  from about the 9th  century onward  as middle persian was on the threshold of becoming new persian  the older form of the language came to be erroneously called pahlavi  which was actually but one of the writing systems used to render both middle persian as well as various other middle iranian languages  that writing system had previously been adopted by the sassanids  who were persians  i e  from the southwest  from the preceding arsacids  who were parthians  i e  from the northeast   while ibn al-muqaffa'   eighth century  still distinguished between pahlavi  i e  parthian  and persian  in arabic text  al-farisiyah)   i e  middle persian   this distinction is not evident in arab commentaries written after that date gernot windfuhr considers new persian as an evolution of the old persian language and the middle persian but also states that none of the known middle persian dialects is the direct predecessor of modern ludwig paul states   the language of the shahnameh should be seen as one instance of continuous historical development from middle to new persian  is conventionally divided into three stages early new persian remains largely intelligible to speakers of contemporary persian  as the morphology and  to a lesser extent  the lexicon of the language have remained relatively persian  is taken to replace middle persian in the course of the 8th  to 9th  centuries  under abbasid with the decline of the abbasids began the reestablishment of persian national life and persians laid the foundations for a renaissance in the realm of letters  new persian as an independent literary language first emerges in bactria through the adaptation of the spoken form of sassanian middle persian court language called dari  the cradle of the persian literary renaissance lay in the east of greater iran in greater khorasan and transoxiana close to the amu darya  modern day mastery of the newer speech having now been transformed from middle into new persian was already complete by the era of the three princely dynasties of iranian origin  the tahirid dynasty (820–872),  saffarid dynasty (860–903)  and samanid empire (874–999),  and could develop only in range and power of of merv is mentioned as being the earliest minstrel to chant verse in the newer persian tongue and after him the poems of hanzala badghisi were among the most famous between the persian-speakers  of the first poems of the persian language  a language historically called dari  emerged in the first significant persian poet was rudaki  he flourished in the 10th  century  when the samanids were at the height of their power  his reputation as a court poet and as an accomplished musician and singer has survived  although little of his poetry has been preserved  among his lost works is versified fables collected in the kalila wa language spread geographically from the 11th  century on and was the medium through which among others  central asian turks became familiar with islam and urban culture  new persian was widely used as a trans-regional  lingua franca  a task for which it was particularly suitable due to its relatively simple morphological structure and this situation persisted until at least 19th  in the late middle ages  new islamic literary languages were created on the persian model  ottoman turkish  chagatai and urdu  which are regarded as  structural daughter languages  of persian  loosely refers to the standardized language of medieval persia used in literature and poetry  this is the language of the 10th  to 12th  centuries  which continued to be used as literary language and lingua franca under the  persianized  turko-mongol  dynasties during the 12th  to 15th  centuries  and under restored persian rule during the 16th  to 19th  during this time served as lingua franca of greater persia and of much of the indian subcontinent  it was also the official and cultural language of many islamic dynasties  including the samanids  buyids  tahirids  ziyarids  the mughal empire  timurids  ghaznavids  seljuqs  khwarazmians  the sultanate of rum  the shirvanshahs  safavids  afsharids  zands  qajars  ottomans and also many mughal successors such as the nizam of hyderabad  persian was the only non-european  language known and used by marco polo at the court of kublai khan and in his journeys through anatolia having been ruled at various times prior to the middle ages by various persian-speaking  dynasties originating in iran  the language lost its traditional foothold there with the demise of the sasanian empire  centuries later however  the practise and usage of persian in the region would be strongly revived  a branch of the seljuks  the sultanate of rum  took persian language  art and letters to they adopted persian language as the official language of the the ottomans  which can roughly be seen as their eventual successors  took this tradition over  persian was the official court language of the empire  and for some time  the official language of the the educated and noble class of the ottoman empire all spoke persian  such as sultan selim i  despite being safavid iran s archrival and a staunch opposer of shia it was a major literary language in the some of the noted earlier persian works during the ottoman rule are idris bidlisi s hasht bihisht  which begun in 1502  and covered the reign of the first eight ottoman rulers  and the salim-namah,  a glorification of selim after a period of several centuries  ottoman turkish  which was highly persianised itself  had developed towards a fully accepted language of literature  which was even able to satisfy the demands of a scientific however  the number of persian and arabic loanwords contained in those works increased at times up to persian language influenced the formation of many modern languages in west asia  europe  central asia  and south asia  following the turko-persian  ghaznavid conquest of south asia  persian was firstly introduced in the region by turkic central the basis in general for the introduction of persian language into the subcontinent was set  from its earliest days  by various persianized central asian turkic and afghan for five centuries prior to the british colonization  persian was widely used as a second language in the indian subcontinent  due to the admiration the mughals  who were of turco-mongol  origin  had for the foreign language  it took prominence as the language of culture and education in several muslim courts on the subcontinent and became the sole  official language  under the mughal emperors  beginning in 1843,  though  english and hindustani gradually replaced persian in importance on the evidence of persian s historical influence there can be seen in the extent of its influence on certain languages of the indian subcontinent  words borrowed from persian are still quite commonly used in certain indo-aryan  languages  especially urdu  also historically known as hindustani  there is also a small population of zoroastrian iranis in india  who migrated around 16th-18th  century to escape religious execution in qajar iran and speak a dari dialect in the 19th  century  under the qajar dynasty  the dialect spoken in tehran rose to prominence  this became the basis of what is now known as  contemporary standard persian  there is still substantial arabic vocabulary  but many of these words have been integrated into persian phonology and grammar  in addition  since the 19th  century numerous russian  french  and english terms have been borrowed  especially vocabulary related to technology  the iranian national academy of persian language and literature is responsible for evaluating neologisms in order to devise their persian equivalents there are three modern varieties of standard persian all these three varieties are based on the classic persian literature and its literary tradition  there are also several local dialects from iran  afghanistan and tajikistan which slightly differ from the standard persian  the hazaragi dialect  in central afghanistan and pakistan   herati  in western afghanistan   darwazi  in afghanistan and tajikistan   and the tehrani accent  in iran  the basis of standard iranian persian  are examples of these dialects  persian-speaking  peoples of iran  afghanistan  and tajikistan can understand one another with a relatively high degree of mutual following are some languages closely related to persian  or in some cases are considered dialects iranian persian has six vowels and twenty-three  consonants historically  persian has distinguished length  early new persian had a series of five long vowels   iː    uː    ɒː    oː  and  eː   along with three short vowels  æ    i  and  u   at some point prior to the 16th  century in the general area now modern iran   eː  and  iː  merged into  iː   and  oː  and  uː  merged into  uː   thus  older contrasts such as شیر‎ shēr  lion  vs  شیر‎ shīr  milk   and زود‎ zūd  quick  vs زور‎ zōr  strong  were lost  however  there are exceptions to this rule  and in some words  ē and ō are needed  or merged into the diphthongs and  which are descendants of the diphthongs and in early new persian   instead of merging into  iː  and  uː   examples of the exception can be found in words such as روشن‎  bright  however  in dari  the archaic distinction of  eː  and  iː   respectively known as یای مجهول‎ yā-ye  majhūl and یای معروف‎ yā-ye  ma rūf  is still preserved as well as the distinction of  oː  and  uː   known as واو مجهول‎ wāw-e  majhūl and واو معروف‎ wāw-e  ma rūf   on the other hand  in standard tajik  the length distinction has disappeared  and  iː  merged with  i  and  uː  with therefore  contemporary afghan dari dialects are the closest to the vowel inventory of early new persian according to most studies on the subject  e g  samareh 1977,  pisowicz 1985,  najafi 2001),  the three vowels traditionally considered long   i    u    ɒ   are currently distinguished from their short counterparts   e    o    æ   by position of articulation rather than by length  however  there are studies  e g  hayes 1979,  windfuhr 1979)  that consider vowel length to be the active feature of the system  with  ɒ    i   and  u  phonologically long or bimoraic and  æ    e   and  o  phonologically short or monomoraic there are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the iranian system  such as toosarvandani 2004).  that offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity  which often suggests that modern persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of classical persian and a hypothetical future persian  which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active feature the length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style  poetry for all varieties  including tajik  suffixes predominate persian morphology  though there are a small number of verbs can express tense and aspect  and they agree with the subject in person and there is no grammatical gender in persian  and pronouns are not marked for natural gender normal declarative sentences are structured as  s   pp   o  v  sentences have optional subjects  prepositional phrases  and objects followed by a compulsory verb  if the object is specific  the object is followed by the word rā and precedes prepositional phrases   s   o   rā   pp  makes extensive use of word building and combining affixes  stems  nouns and adjectives  persian frequently uses derivational agglutination to form new words from nouns  adjectives  and verbal stems  new words are extensively formed by compounding – two existing words combining into a new one  as is common in german while having a lesser influence on and other languages of mesopotamia and its core vocabulary being of middle persian new persian contains a considerable amount of arabic lexical which were and often took a different meaning and usage than the arabic original  persian loanwords of arabic origin especially include islamic terms  the arabic vocabulary in other iranian  turkic and indic languages is generally understood to have been copied from new persian  not from arabic r  perry  in his article lexical areas and semantic fields of arabic  estimates that about 24  percent of an everyday vocabulary of 20,000  words in current persian  and more than 25  percent of the vocabulary of classical and modern persian literature  are of arabic origin  the text frequency of these loan words is generally lower and varies by style and topic area  it may approach 25  percent of a text in among the arabic loan words  relatively few (14  percent  are from the semantic domain of material culture  while a larger number are from domains of intellectual and spiritual most of the arabic words used in persian are either synonyms of native terms or could be glossed in inclusion of mongolian and turkic elements in the persian language should also be not only because of the political role a succession of turkic dynasties played in iranian history  but also because of the immense prestige persian language and literature enjoyed in the wider (non-arab)  islamic world  which was often ruled by sultans and emirs with a turkic background  the turkish and mongolian vocabulary in persian is minor in comparison to that of arabic and these words were mainly confined to military  pastoral terms and political sector  titles  administration  new military and political titles were coined based partially on middle persian  e g  ارتش‎ arteš for  army   instead of the uzbek قؤشین‎ qoʻshin  سرلشکر‎ sarlaškar  دریابان‎ daryābān  etc   in the 20th  century  persian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages  especially other indo-european  languages such as urdu  and  to a lesser extent  hindi  the latter two through conquests of persianized central asian turkic and afghan turkic languages such as ottoman turkish  chagatai  tatar  turkmen  uzbek  and caucasian languages such as and to a lesser extent  avar and afro-asiatic  languages like assyrian  list of loanwords in assyrian neo-aramaic)  and and even dravidian languages indirectly especially telugu and brahui  as well as austronesian languages such as indonesian and malay  persian has also had a significant lexical influence  via turkish  on albanian  serbian  croatian  bosnian  and serbo-croatian,  particularly as spoken in bosnia and herzegovina use of occasional foreign synonyms instead of persian words can be a common practice in everyday communications as an alternative expression  in some instances in addition to the persian vocabulary  the equivalent synonyms from multiple foreign languages can be used  for example  in iranian colloquial persian  not in afghanistan or tajikistan   the phrase  thank you  may be expressed using the french word مرسی‎ merci  stressed  however  on the first syllable   the hybrid persian-arabic  phrase متشکّر ام‎ motešakker am  متشکّر‎ motešakker being  merciful  in arabic  commonly pronounced motčakker in persian  and the verb ام‎ am meaning  i am  in persian   or by the pure persian phrase سپاس‌گزار ام‎ sepās-gozār  am the vast majority of modern iranian persian and dari text is written with the arabic script  tajiki  which is considered by some linguists to be a persian dialect influenced by russian and the turkic languages of central is written with the cyrillic script in tajikistan  see tajik alphabet  modern iranian persian and afghan persian are written using a modified variant of the arabic alphabet  which uses different pronunciation and additional letters not found in arabic  tajik persian  as used in tajikistan  is typically written in a modified version of the cyrillic script  there also exist several romanization systems for persian  after the muslim conquest of persia  it took approximately 150  years before persians adopted the arabic script in place of the older alphabet  previously  two different scripts were used  pahlavi  used for middle persian  and the avestan alphabet  in persian  dīndapirak or din dabire—literally  religion script   used for religious purposes  primarily for the avestan but sometimes for middle persian in the modern persian script  historically short vowels are usually not written  only the historically long ones are represented in the text  so words distinguished from each other only by short vowels are ambiguous in writing  western persian kerm  worm   karam  generosity   kerem  cream   and krom  chrome  are all spelled krm  کرم‎  in persian  the reader must determine the word from context  the arabic system of vocalization marks known as harakat is also used in persian  although some of the symbols have different pronunciations  for example  a ḍammah is pronounced while in iranian persian it is pronounced this system is not used in mainstream persian literature  it is primarily used for teaching and in some  but not all  dictionaries there are several letters generally only used in arabic loanwords  these letters are pronounced the same as similar persian letters  for example  there are four functionally identical letters for  z   ز ذ ض ظ‎   three letters for  s   س ص ث‎   two letters for  t   ط ت‎   two letters for  h   ح ه‎   on the other hand  there are four letters that don t exist in arabic پ چ ژ گ‎ the persian alphabet adds four letters to the arabic alphabet historically  there was used also a special letter for the sound  β   this letter is used no more as the /β/-sound  changed to  b   i e  archaic زڤان  zaβān    زبان  zæbɒn   language the persian alphabet also modifies some letters of the arabic alphabet  for example  alef with hamza below   إ‎   changes to alef   ا‎    words using various hamzas get spelled with yet another kind of hamza  so that مسؤول‎ becomes مسئول‎  even though the latter is also correct in arabic  and teh marbuta   ة‎   changes to heh   ه‎   or teh   ت‎   the letters different in shape are the international organization for standardization has published a standard for simplified transliteration of persian into latin  iso 233-3,  titled  information and documentation – transliteration of arabic characters into latin characters – part 3:  persian language – simplified but the transliteration scheme is not in widespread use another latin alphabet  based on the common turkic alphabet  was used in tajikistan in the 1920s  and 1930s.  the alphabet was phased out in favor of cyrillic in the late is persian using iso basic latin alphabet  it is most commonly used in chat  emails and sms applications  the orthography is not standardized  and varies among writers and even media  for example  typing  aa  for the phoneme is easier on computer keyboards than on cellphone keyboards  resulting in smaller usage of the combination on cellphones  the cyrillic script was introduced for writing the tajik language under the tajik soviet socialist republic in the late 1930s,  replacing the latin alphabet that had been used since the october revolution and the persian script that had been used earlier  after 1939,  materials published in persian in the persian script were banned from the following text is from article 1  of the universal declaration of human rights
