 metric system -  wikipediathe metric system is an internationally agreed decimal system of measurement  it was originally based on the mètre des archives and the kilogramme des archives introduced by the french first republic in but over the years the definitions of the metre and the kilogram have been refined  and the metric system has been extended to incorporate many more units  although a number of variants of the metric system emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  the term is now often used as a synonym for 1]  or the  international system of units —the official system of measurement in almost every country in the world the metric system has been officially sanctioned for use in the united states since but the u s  remains the only industrialised country that has not fully adopted the metric system as its official system of measurement  although in 1988  the united states congress passed the omnibus foreign trade and competitiveness act  which designates  the metric system of measurement as the preferred system of weights and measures for u s  trade and commerce   among many other things  the act requires federal agencies to use metric measurements in nearly all of its activities  although there are still some exceptions allowing traditional linear units to be used in documents intended for consumers  many sources also cite the countries of liberia and myanmar  burma  as the only other countries not to have done so  although the united kingdom also uses the metric system for most administrative and trade purposes  imperial units are widely used by the public and are permitted or obligatory for some purposes  such as road signs although the originators intended to devise a system that was equally accessible to all  it proved necessary to use prototype units in the custody of national or local authorities as standards  control of the prototype units of measure was maintained by the later french governments until 1875,  when it was passed to an international intergovernmental organisation  the general conference on weights and measures 1]from  its beginning  the main features of the metric system were the standard set of interrelated base units and a standard set of prefixes in powers of ten  these base units are used to derive larger and smaller units that could replace a huge number of other units of measure in existence  although the system was first developed for commercial use  the development of coherent units of measure made it particularly suitable for science and engineering the uncoordinated use of the metric system by different scientific and engineering disciplines  particularly in the late 19th  century  resulted in different choices of base units even though all were based on the same definitions of the units of the metre and the kilogram  during the 20th  century  efforts were made to rationalise these units  and in 1960,  the cgpm published the international system of units  which has since then been the internationally recognised standard metric system although the metric system has changed and developed since its inception  its basic concepts have hardly changed  designed for transnational use  it consisted of a basic set of units of measurement  now known as base units  derived units were built up from the base units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and derived units were decimal-based  and identified by a standard set of prefixes at the outbreak of the french revolution in 1789,  most countries and even some cities had their own system of measurement  although different countries might have used units of measure with the same name  such as the foot  or local language equivalents such as pied  fuß  and voet  there was no consistency in the magnitude of those units  nor in the relationships with their multiples and much like the modern-day  differences between the us and the uk pints and metric system was designed to be universal—in the words of the french philosopher marquis de condorcet it was to be  for all people for all it was designed for ordinary people  for engineers who worked in human-related  measurements and for astronomers and physicists who worked with numbers both small and large  hence the huge range of the prefixes that have been defined in the french government first investigated the idea of overhauling their system of measurement  the concept of universality was put into practice in 1789:  maurice de talleyrand  acting on condorcet s advice  invited john riggs miller  a british parliamentarian and thomas jefferson  the american secretary of state to george washington  to work with the french in producing an international standard by promoting legislation in their respective legislative bodies  however  these early overtures failed and the custody of the metric system remained in the hands of the french government until languages where the distinction is made  unit names are common nouns  i e  not proper nouns   they use the character set and follow the grammatical rules of the language concerned  for example  kilomètre    kilómetro   but each unit has a symbol that is independent of language  for example  km  for  kilometre    v  for  volts  the metric system  multiples and submultiples of units follow a decimal 2]  a concept identified as a possibility in 1586  by simon stevin  the flemish mathematician who had introduced decimal fractions into this is done at the cost of losing the simplicity associated with many traditional systems of units where division by 3  does not result in awkward fractions  for example one third of a foot is four inches  a simplicity that in 1790  was debated  but rejected by the originators of the metric in 1854,  in the introduction to the proceedings of the decimal association  the mathematician augustus de morgan summarised the advantages of a decimal-based  system over a non-decimal  system thus   in the simple rules of arithmetic  we practice a pure decimal system  nowhere interrupted by the entrance of any other system  from column to column we never carry anything but common set of decimal-based  prefixes that have the effect of multiplication or division by an integer power of ten can be applied to units that are themselves too large or too small for practical use  the concept of using consistent classical  latin or greek  names for the prefixes was first proposed in a report by the revolutionary  commission on weights and measures in may the prefix kilo  for example  is used to multiply the unit by 1000,  and the prefix milli is to indicate a one-thousandth  part of the unit  thus the kilogram and kilometre are a thousand grams and metres respectively  and a milligram and millimetre are one thousandth of a gram and metre respectively  these relations can be written symbolically the early days  multipliers that were positive powers of ten were given greek-derived  prefixes such as kilo-  and mega-,  and those that were negative powers of ten were given latin-derived  prefixes such as centi-  and milli-.  however  1935  extensions to the prefix system did not follow this convention  the prefixes nano-  and micro-,  for example have greek during the 19th  century the prefix myria-,  derived from the greek word μύριοι  mýrioi   was used as a multiplier for applying prefixes to derived units of area and volume that are expressed in terms of units of length squared or cubed  the square and cube operators are applied to the unit of length including the prefix  as illustrated are not usually used to indicate multiples of a second greater than 1;  the non-si  units of minute  hour and day are used instead  on the other hand  prefixes are used for multiples of the non-si  unit of volume  the litre  l  l  such as millilitres base units used in the metric system must be realisable  ideally with reference to natural phenomena rather than unique artefacts  each of the base units in si is accompanied by a mise en pratique realisation  published by the bipm that describes in detail at least one way in which the base unit can be where possible  definitions of the base units were developed so that any laboratory equipped with proper instruments would be able to realise a standard without reliance on an artefact held by another country  in practice  such realisation is done under the auspices of a mutual acceptance arrangement the original version of the metric system the base units could be derived from a specified length  the metre  and the weight of a specified volume   1⁄7003100000000000000♠1000  of a cubic metre  of pure water  initially the de facto french government of the day  the assemblée nationale constituante  considered defining the metre as the length of a pendulum that has a period of one second at 45°n  and an altitude equal to sea level  the altitude and latitude were specified to accommodate variations in gravity  the specified latitude was a compromise between the latitude of london (51°  30'n),  paris (48°  50'n)  and the median parallel of the united states (38°n)  to accommodate however the mathematician borda persuaded the assembly that a survey having its ends at sea level and based on a meridian that spanned at least 10%  of the earth s quadrant would be more appropriate for such a available technology of the 1790s  made it impracticable to use these definitions as the basis of the kilogram and the metre  so prototypes that represented these quantities insofar as was practicable were manufactured  on 22  june 1799  these prototypes were adopted as the definitive reference pieces  deposited in the archives nationales and became known as the mètre des archives and the kilogramme des archives  copies were made and distributed around these artefacts were replaced in 1889  by the new prototypes manufactured under international supervision  insofar as was possible  the new prototypes were exact copies of the original prototypes  but used a later technology to ensure better stability  one of each of the kilogram and metre prototypes were chosen by lot to serve as the definitive international reference piece with the remainder being distributed to signatories of the metre in 1889  there was no generally accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960  the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre  in that year the prototype metre was replaced by a formal definition that defines the metre in terms of the wavelength of specified light spectra  by 1983  it was accepted that the speed of light in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length  therefore  the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light  these definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone  anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory  to make a standard of the other base units rely on a prototype – all are based on phenomena that are directly observable and had been in use for many years before formally becoming part of the metric system the second first became a de facto base unit within the metric system when  in 1832,  carl friedrich gauss used it  the centimetre and the gram to derive the units associated with values of absolute measurements of the earth s magnetic the second  if based on the earth s rotation  is not a constant as the earth s rotation is slowing down—in 2008  the solar day was 0.002  s longer than in this had been known for many years  consequently in 1952  the international astronomical union  iau  defined the second in terms of the earth s rotation in the year 1900.  measurements of time were made using extrapolation from readings based on astronomy  with the launch of si in 1960,  the 11th  cgpm adopted the iau in the years that followed  atomic clocks became significantly more reliable and precise  and in 1968  the 13th  cgpm redefined the second in terms of a specific frequency from the emission spectrum of the caesium 133  atom  a component of atomic clocks  this provided the means to measure the time associated with astronomical phenomena rather than using astronomical phenomena as the basis from which time measurements were cgs absolute unit of electric current  the abampere  had been defined in terms of the force between two parallel current-carrying  wires in in the 1940s,  the international electrotechnical commission adopted an mks variant of this definition for the ampere  which was adopted in 1948  by the has always been based on observable phenomena—in 1744  the degree 3]  was based on the freezing and boiling points of in 1948  the cgpm adopted the centigrade scale  renamed it the  celsius  temperature scale name and defined it in terms of the triple point of the mole and the candela were accepted by the cgpm in 1971  and 1975  respectively  both had been defined by third parties by reference to phenomena rather than variant of the metric system has a degree of coherence—the various derived units are directly related to the base units without the need for intermediate conversion for example  in a coherent system the units of force  energy and power are chosen so that the equationshold without the introduction of unit conversion factors  once a set of coherent units have been defined  other relationships in physics that use those units will automatically be true  therefore  einstein s mass-energy  equation  e   mc2,  does not require extraneous constants when expressed in coherent cgs system had two units of energy  the erg that was related to mechanics and the calorie that was related to thermal energy  so only one of them  the erg  could bear a coherent relationship to the base units  coherence was a design aim of si resulting in only one unit of energy being defined – the si  which is a coherent system  the unit of power is the  watt   which is defined as  one joule per in the us customary system of measurement  which is non-coherent,  the unit of power is the  horsepower   which is defined as "550  foot-pounds  per second   the pound in this context being the similarly  neither the us gallon nor the imperial gallon is one cubic foot or one cubic yard— the us gallon is 231  cubic inches and the imperial gallon is 277.42  cubic concept of coherence was only introduced into the metric system in the third quarter of the 19th  in its original form the metric system was non-coherent—in  particular the litre was 0.001  m3  and the are  from which the hectare derives  was 100  m2.  however the units of mass and length were related to each other through the physical properties of water  the gram having been designed as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at its freezing 1585  the flemish mathematician simon stevin published a small pamphlet called de theinde   the tenth    decimal fractions had been employed for the extraction of square roots some five centuries before his time  but nobody used decimal numbers in daily life  stevin declared that using decimals was so important that the universal introduction of decimal weights  measures and coinage was only a matter of of the earliest proposals for a decimal system in which length  area  volume and mass were linked to each other was made by john wilkins  first secretary of the royal society of london in his 1668  essay  an essay towards a real character and a philosophical language   his proposal used a pendulum that had a beat of one second as the basis of the unit of two years later  in 1670,  gabriel mouton  a french abbot and scientist  proposed a decimal system of length based on the circumference of the earth  his suggestion was that a unit  the milliare  be defined as a minute of arc along a meridian  he then suggested a system of sub-units,  dividing successively by factors of ten into the centuria  decuria  virga  virgula  decima  centesima  and millesima  his ideas attracted interest at the time  and were supported by both jean picard and christiaan huygens in 1673,  and also studied at the royal society in london  in the same year  gottfried leibniz independently made proposals similar to those of pre-revolutionary  europe  each state had its own system of units of some countries  such as spain and russia  saw the advantages of harmonising their units of measure with those of their trading however  vested interests who profited from variations in units of measure opposed this  this was particularly prevalent in france where the huge inconsistency in the size of units of measure was one of the causes that  in 1789,  led to the outbreak of the french during the early years of the revolution  4]  including the marquis de condorcet  pierre-simon  laplace  adrien-marie  legendre  antoine lavoisier and jean-charles  de borda set up a commission of weights and measures  the commission was of the opinion that the country should adopt a completely new system of measure based on the principles of logic and natural logic dictated that such a system should be based on the radix used for counting  their report of march 1791  to the assemblée nationale constituante considered but rejected the view of laplace that a duodecimal system of counting should replace the existing decimal system  the view such a system was bound to fail prevailed  the commission s final recommendation was that the assembly should promote a decimal-based  system of measurement  the leaders of the assembly accepted the views of the france attempted to work with other countries towards the adoption of a common set of units of among the supporters of such an international system of units was thomas jefferson who  in 1790,  presented a document plan for establishing uniformity in the coinage  weights  and measures of the united states to congress in which he advocated a decimal system that used traditional names for units  such as ten inches per the report was considered but not adopted by 249–250the  french law of 18  germinal  year iii (7  april 1795)  defined five units of system continued the tradition of having separate base units for geometrically related dimensions  e g   mètre for lengths  are (100  m2)  for areas  stère (1  m3)  for dry capacities  and litre (1  dm3)  for liquid capacities  the hectare  equal to a hundred ares  the area of a square 100  metres on a side  about 2.47  acres   is still in use  the early metric system included only a few prefixes from milli  one thousandth  to myria  ten the kilogramme  defined as being one pinte  later renamed the litre  of water at the melting point of ice  was called the the gramme being an alternative name for a thousandth of a grave  however  the word grave  being a synonym for the title  count   had aristocratic connotations and was renamed the kilogramme  the name mètre was suggested by auguste-savinien  leblond in may 92france  officially adopted the metric system on 10  december 1799.  although it was decreed that its use was to be mandatory in paris that year and across the provinces the following year  the decree was not universally observed across annexed by france during the napoleonic era were the first to inherit the metric system  in 1812,  napoleon introduced a system known as mesures usuelles  which used the names of pre-metric  units of measure  but defined them in terms of metric units – for example  the livre metrique  metric pound  was 500  g and the toise metrique  metric fathom  was 2  after the congress of vienna in 1815,  france lost the territories that she had annexed  some  such as the papal states reverted to their pre-revolutionary  units of measure  others such as baden adopted a modified version of the mesures usuelles  but france kept her system of measurement 1817,  the netherlands reintroduced the metric system  but used pre-revolutionary  names—for example 1  centimetre became the duim  thumb   the ons  ounce  became 100  g and so certain german states adopted similar and in 1852  the german zollverein  customs union  adopted the zollpfund  customs pound  of 500  g for intrastate in 1872  the newly formed german empire adopted the metric system as its official system of weights and and the newly formed kingdom of italy likewise  following the lead given by piedmont  adopted the metric system in exposition universelle (1867)   paris exhibition  devoted a stand to the metric system and by 1875,  two thirds of the european population and close to half the world s population had adopted the metric system  by 1872,  the only principal european countries not to have adopted the metric system were russia and the united 1920,  countries comprising 22%  of the world s population  mainly english-speaking,  used the imperial system or the closely related us customary system  25%  used mainly the metric system and the remaining 53%  used 1927,  several million people in the united states sent over 100,000  petitions backed by the metric association and the general federation of women s clubs urging congress to adopt the metric system  the petition was opposed by the manufacturing industry  citing the cost of the 1861  a committee of the british association for advancement of science  baas  including william thomson  later lord kelvin   james clerk maxwell and james prescott joule introduced the concept of a coherent system of units based on the metre  gram and second  which  in 1873,  was extended to include electrical 20  may 1875  an international treaty known as the convention du mètre  metre was signed by 17  states  this treaty established the following organisations to conduct international activities relating to a uniform system for 1881  first international electrical congress adopted the baas recommendations on electrical units  followed by a series of congresses in which further units of measure were defined and the international electrotechnical commission  iec  was set up with the specific task of overseeing electrical units of this was followed by the international congress of radiology  isr  who  at their inaugural meeting in 1926,  initiated the definition of radiological-related  units of in 1921  the metre convention was extended to cover all units of measure  not just length and mass and in 1933  the 8th  cgpm resolved to work with other international bodies to agree standards for electrical units that could be related back to the international since 1954  the cipm committee that oversees the definition of units of measurement  the consultative committee for 5]  has representatives from many international organisations including the isr  iec and iso under the chairmanship of the number of variants of the metric system evolved  all using the mètre des archives and kilogramme des archives  or their descendants  as their base units  but differing in the definitions of the various derived units the centimetre gram second system of units  cgs  was the first coherent metric system  having been developed in the 1860s  and promoted by maxwell and thomson  in 1874,  this system was formally promoted by the british association for the advancement of science the system s characteristics are that density is expressed in g/cm3,  force expressed in dynes and mechanical energy in ergs  thermal energy was defined in calories  one calorie being the energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from 15.5  °c to 16.5  °c  the meeting also proposed two sets of units for electrical and magnetic properties – the electrostatic set of units and the electromagnetic set of cgs units of electricity were cumbersome to work with  this was remedied at the 1893  international electrical congress held in chicago by defining the  international  ampere and ohm using definitions based on the metre  kilogram and in 1901,  giovanni giorgi showed that by adding an electrical unit as a fourth base unit  the various anomalies in electromagnetic systems could be resolved  the metre-kilogram-second-coulomb   mksc  and metre-kilogram-second-ampere   mksa  systems are examples of such international system of units  système international d unités or si  is the current international standard metric system and is also the system most widely used around the world  it is an extension of giorgi s mksa system—its base units are the metre  kilogram  second  ampere  kelvin  candela and metre-tonne-second  system of units  mts  was based on the metre  tonne and second – the unit of force was the sthène and the unit of pressure was the pièze  it was invented in france for industrial use and from 1933  to 1955  was used both in france and in the soviet metric systems use the kilogram-force   kilopond  as a base unit of force  with mass measured in a unit known as the hyl  technische mass einheit  tme   mug or metric although the cgpm passed a resolution in 1901  defining the standard value of acceleration due to gravity to be 980.665  cm/s2,  gravitational units are not part of the international system of units 9th  cgpm met in 1948,  three years after the end of the second world war and fifteen years after the 8th  cgpm  in response to formal requests made by the international union of pure and applied physics and by the french government to establish a practical system of units of measure  the cgpm requested the cipm to prepare recommendations for such a system  suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the metre convention  the recommendation also catalogued symbols for the most important mks and cgs units of measure and for the first time the cgpm made recommendations concerning derived at the same time the cgpm formally adopted a recommendation for the writing and printing of unit symbols and of cipm s draft proposal  which was an extensive revision and simplification of the metric unit definitions  symbols and terminology based on the mks system of units  was put to the 10th  cgpm in 1954.  in accordance with giorgi s proposals of 1901,  the cipm also recommended that the ampere be the base unit from which electromechanical units would be derived  the definitions for the ohm and volt that had previously been in use were discarded and these units became derived units based on the metre  ampere  second and kilogram  after negotiations with the international commission on illumination 1]  and iupap  two further base units  the degree kelvin and the candela were also proposed as base the full system and name  système international d unités  were adopted at the 11th  cgpm in october during the years that followed the definitions of the base units and particularly the methods of applying these definitions have been formal definition of international system of units  si  along with the associated resolutions passed by the cgpm and the cipm are published by the bipm in brochure form at regular intervals  the eighth edition of the brochure le système international d unités—the international system of units was published in 2006  and is available on the in october 2011,  at the 24th  cgpm proposals were made to change the definitions of four of the base units  these changes should not affect the average si  as published by the cgpm  should  in theory  meet all the requirements of commerce  science and technology  certain units of measure have acquired such a position within the world community that it is likely they will be used for many years to come  in order that such units are used consistently around the world  the cgpm catalogued such units in tables 6  to 9  of the si brochure  these categories usage of the metric system varies around the world  according to the us central intelligence agency s factbook (2007),  the international system of units has been adopted as the official system of weights and measures by all nations in the world except for myanmar  burma   liberia and the united while the nist has identified the united states as the only industrialised country where the metric system is not the predominant system of however  reports published since 2007  hold this is no longer true of myanmar or an agence france-presse  report from 2010  stated that sierra leone had passed a law to replace the imperial system with the metric system thereby aligning its system of measurement with that used by its mano river union  mru  neighbours guinea and reports from myanmar suggest that the country is also planning to adopt the metric the united states metric units  authorised by congress in are widely used in science  medicine  military  and partially in industry  but customary units predominate in household use  at retail stores the litre is a commonly used unit for volume  especially on bottles of beverages  and milligrams are used to denominate the amounts of medications  rather than on the other hand  non-metric  units are used in certain regulated environments such as nautical miles and knots in international aviation  resistance to metrication  particularly in the uk and the us  has been connected to the perceived cost involved  a sense of patriotism and lack of desire to conform the countries of the commonwealth of nations the metric system has replaced the imperial system by varying degrees  australia  new zealand and commonwealth countries in africa are almost totally metric  india is mostly metric while canada is partly metric  in the united kingdom  the metric system  the use of which was first permitted for trade in 1864,  is used in much government business  in most industries including building  health and engineering and for pricing by measure or weight in most trading situations  both wholesale and however the imperial system is widely used by the british public  such as feet and inches as a measurement of height  weight in stone and pounds  and is legally mandated in various cases  such as road-sign  distances  which must be given in yards and in 2007,  the european commission announced that it was to abandon the requirement for metric-only  labelling on packaged goods in the uk  and to allow dual metric–imperial marking to continue other jurisdictions  such as hong kong  have laws mandating or permitting other systems of measurement in parallel with the metric system in some or all si symbols for the metric units are intended to be identical  regardless of the language but unit names are ordinary nouns and use the character set and follow the grammatical rules of the language concerned  for example  the si unit symbol for kilometre is  km  everywhere in the world  even though the local language word for the unit name may vary  language variants for the kilometre unit name include  chilometro  italian   kilometer 7]  kilometer  dutch   kilomètre  french   χιλιόμετρο  greek   quilómetro quilômetro  portuguese   kilómetro  spanish  and километр are also found with the spelling of unit names in countries using the same language  including differences in american english and british spelling  for example  meter and liter are used in the united states whereas metre and litre are used in other english-speaking  countries  in addition  the official us spelling for the rarely used si prefix for ten is deka  in american english the term metric ton is the normal usage whereas in other varieties of english tonne is common  gram is also sometimes spelled gramme in english-speaking  countries other than the united states  though this older usage is dual usage of or confusion between metric and non-metric  units has resulted in a number of serious incidents  these include during its evolution  the metric system has adopted many units of measure  the introduction of si rationalised both the way in which units of measure were defined and also the list of units in use  these are now catalogued in the official si the table below lists the units of measure in this catalogue and shows the conversion factors connecting them with the equivalent units that were in use on the eve of the adoption of si brochure also catalogues certain non-si  units that are widely used with the si in matters of everyday life or units that are exactly defined values in terms of si units and are used in particular circumstances to satisfy the needs of commercial  legal  or specialised scientific interests  these units the metre was redefined in 1960,  the kilogram was the only si base unit that relied on a specific artefact  after the 1996–1998  recalibrations a clear divergence between the international and various national prototype kilograms was the 23rd  cgpm (2007),  the cipm was mandated to investigate the use of natural constants as the basis for all units of measure rather than the artefacts that were then in use  at a meeting of the ccu held in reading  united kingdom in september 2010,  a and draft changes to the si brochure that were to be presented to the next meeting of the cipm in october 2010  were agreed to in the ccu proposed tothe cipm meeting of october 2010  found that  the conditions set by the general conference at its 23rd  meeting have not yet been fully met  for this reason the cipm does not propose a revision of the si at the present the cipm did however sponsor a resolution at the 24th  cgpm in which the changes were agreed in principle and that were expected to be finalised at the 25th  cgpm in
