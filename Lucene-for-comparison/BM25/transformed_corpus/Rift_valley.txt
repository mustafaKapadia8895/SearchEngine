 rift valley -  wikipediaa rift valley is a linear-shaped  lowland between several highlands or mountain ranges created by the action of a geologic rift or fault  a rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary  a crustal extension  a spreading apart of the surface  which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion  when the tensional forces were strong enough to cause the plate to split apart  a center block dropped between the two blocks at its flanks  forming a graben  the drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new  that feature is the beginning of the rift valley  but as the process continues  the valley widens  until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area  one of the best known examples of this process is the east african on earth  rifts can occur at all elevations  from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust  they are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive  valleys  which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically the most extensive rift valley is located along the crest of the mid-ocean  ridge system and is the result of sea floor spreading  examples of this type of rift include the mid-atlantic  ridge and the east pacific rise many existing continental rift valleys are the result of a failed arm  aulacogen  of a triple junction  although there are two  the east african rift and the baikal rift zone  which are currently active  as well as a third which may be  the west antarctic rift  in these instances  not only the crust  but also entire tectonic plates  are in the process of breaking apart to create new plates  if they continue  continental rifts will eventually become oceanic rifts other rift valleys are the result of bends or discontinuities in horizontally-moving  (strike-slip)  faults  when these bends or discontinuities are in the same direction as the relative motions along the fault  extension occurs  for example  for a right lateral-moving  fault  a bend to the right will result in stretching and consequent subsidence in the area of the irregularity  in the view of many geologists today  the dead sea lies in a rift which results from a leftward discontinuity in the left lateral-moving  dead sea transform fault  where a fault breaks into two strands  or two faults run close to each other  crustal extension may also occur between them  as a result of differences in their motions  both types of fault-caused  extension commonly occur on a small scale  producing such features as sag ponds or landslides many of the world s largest lakes are located in rift lake baikal in siberia  a world heritage lies in an active rift valley  baikal is both the deepest lake in the world and  with 20%  of all of the liquid freshwater on earth  has the greatest lake tanganyika  second by both measures  is in the albertine rift  the westernmost arm of the active east african rift  lake superior in north america  the largest freshwater lake by area  lies in the ancient and dormant midcontinent rift  the largest subglacial lake  lake vostok  may also lie in an ancient rift lake nipissing and lake timiskaming in ontario and quebec  canada lie inside a rift valley called the ottawa-bonnechere  Ã¾ingvallavatn  iceland s largest natural lake  is also an example of a rift lake extraterrestrial rift valleys are also known to occur on other terrestrial planets and natural satellites  the 4,000  km long valles marineris on mars is believed by planetary geologists to be a large rift some features of venus  most notably  the 4000  km devana and a part of the western eistla  and possibly also alta and bell regio have been interpreted by some planetary geologists as a rift some natural satellites also have prominent rift valleys  the 2,000  km long ithaca chasma on tethys in the saturn system is a prominent example  charon s nostromo chasma is the first confirmed in the pluto system  however large chasms up to 950  km wide observed on the charon have also been tentatively interpreted by some as giant rifts and similar formations have also been noted on a recent study suggests a complex system of ancient lunar rift valleys including vallis rheita and vallis the uranus system also has prominent examples  with large  chasma  believed to be giant rift valley systems  most notably the 1492  km long messina chasma on titania  622  km kachina chasmata on ariel  verona rupes on and mommur chasma on
