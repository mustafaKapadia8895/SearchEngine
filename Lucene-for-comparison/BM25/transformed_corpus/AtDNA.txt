 autosome -  wikipediaan autosome is a chromosome that is not an allosome  a sex the members of an autosome pair in a diploid cell have the same morphology unlike those in allosome pairs which may have different structure  the dna in autosomes is collectively known as atdna or example  humans have a diploid genome that usually contains 22  pairs of autosomes and one allosome pair (46  chromosomes total   the autosome pairs are labeled with numbers (1–22  in humans  roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs  while allosomes are labelled with their by contrast  the allosome pair consists of two x chromosomes in females or one x and one y chromosome in males   unusual combinations of xyy  xxy  xxx  xxxx  xxxxx or xxyy  among other allosome combinations  are known to occur and usually cause developmental abnormalities  autosomes still contain sexual determination genes even though they are not sex chromosomes  for example  the sry gene on the y chromosome encodes the transcription factor tdf and is vital for male sex determination during development  tdf functions by activating the sox9  gene on chromosome 17,  so mutations of the sox9  gene can cause humans with a y chromosome to develop as human autosomes have been identified and mapped by extracting the chromosomes from a cell arrested in metaphase or prometaphase and then staining them with some sort of dye  most commonly  these chromosomes are typically viewed as karyograms for easy comparison  clinical geneticists can compare the karyogram of an individual to a reference karyogram to discover the cytogenetic basis of certain phenotypes  for example  the karyogram of someone with patau syndrome would show that they possess three copies of chromosome 13.  karyograms and staining techniques can only detect large-scale  disruptions to chromosomes—chromosomal aberrations smaller than a few million base pairs generally cannot be seen on a genetic disorders can arise due to a number of causes  some of the most common being nondisjunction in parental germ cells or mendelian inheritance of deleterious alleles from parents  autosomal genetic disorders which exhibit mendelian inheritance can be inherited either in an autosomal dominant or recessive these disorders manifest in and are passed on by either sex with equal autosomal dominant disorders are often present in both parent and child  as the child needs to inherit only one copy of the deleterious allele to manifest the disease  autosomal recessive diseases  however  require two copies of the deleterious allele for the disease to manifest  because it is possible to possess one copy of a deleterious allele without presenting a disease phenotype  two phenotypically normal parents can have a child with the disease if both parents are carriers  also known as heterozygotes  for the condition autosomal aneuploidy can also result in disease conditions  aneuploidy of autosomes is not well tolerated and usually results in miscarriage of the developing fetus  fetuses with aneuploidy of gene-rich  chromosomes—such as chromosome 1—never  survive to and fetuses with aneuploidy of gene-poor  chromosomes—such as chromosome 21—  are still miscarried over 23%  of the possessing a single copy of an autosome  known as a monosomy  is nearly always incompatible with life  though very rarely some monosomies can survive past birth  having three copies of an autosome  known as a trisomy  is far more compatible with life  however  a common example is down syndrome  which is caused by possessing three copies of chromosome 21  instead of the usual aneuploidy can also occur as a result of unbalanced translocations during deletions of part of a chromosome cause partial monosomies  while duplications can cause partial trisomies  if the duplication or deletion is large enough  it can be discovered by analyzing a karyogram of the individual  autosomal translocations can be responsible for a number of diseases  ranging from cancer to unlike single gene disorders  diseases caused by aneuploidy are the result of improper gene dosage  not nonfunctional gene
