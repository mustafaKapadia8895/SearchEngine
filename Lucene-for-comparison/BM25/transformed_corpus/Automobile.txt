 car -  wikipediaa car  or automobile  is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation  most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads  seat one to eight people  have four tires  and mainly transport people rather than cars came into global use during the 20th  century  and developed economies depend on them  the year 1886  is regarded as the birth year of the modern car  when german inventor karl benz built his benz patent-motorwagen.  cars did not become widely available until the early 20th  century  one of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908  model t  an american car manufactured by the ford motor company  cars were rapidly adopted in the us  where they replaced animal-drawn  carriages and carts  but took much longer to be accepted in western europe and other parts of the world cars have controls for driving  parking  passenger comfort and safety  and controlling a variety of lights  over the decades  additional features and controls have been added to vehicles  making them progressively more complex  examples include rear reversing cameras  air conditioning  navigation systems  and in car entertainment  most cars in use in the 2010s  are propelled by an internal combustion engine  fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels  this causes air pollution and is also blamed for contributing to climate change and global vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel  vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries  electric cars  which were invented early in the history of the car  began to become commercially available in 2008.there  are costs and benefits to car use  the costs include acquiring the vehicle  interest payments  if the car is financed   repairs and maintenance  fuel  depreciation  driving time  parking fees  taxes  and the costs to society include maintaining roads  land use  road congestion  air pollution  public health  health care  and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life  road traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related  deaths benefits include on-demand  transportation  mobility  independence  and the societal benefits include economic benefits  such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry  transportation provision  societal well-being  from leisure and travel opportunities  and revenue generation from the taxes  the ability for people to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching  implications for the nature of it was estimated in 2014  that the number of cars was over 1.25  billion up from the 500  million of the numbers are increasing rapidly  especially in china  india and other newly industrialized word car is believed to originate from the latin word carrus or carrum   wheeled vehicle    or the middle english word carre  meaning "two-wheel  cart   from old north french   in turn  these originated from the gaulish word karros  a gallic it originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn  vehicle  such as a cart  carriage  or  motor car  is attested from 1895,  and is the usual formal name for cars in british  autocar  is a variant that is also attested from 1895,  but that is now considered archaic  it literally means "self-propelled  the term  horseless carriage  was used by some to refer to the first cars at the time that they were being built  and is attested from word  automobile  is a classical compound derived from the ancient greek word autós  αὐτός   meaning  self   and the latin word mobilis  meaning  movable   it entered the english language from french  and was first adopted by the automobile club of great britain in over time  the word  automobile  fell out of favour in britain  and was replaced by  motor car    automobile  remains chiefly north american  particularly as a formal or commercial an abbreviated form   auto   was formerly a common way to refer to cars in english  but is now considered old-fashioned.  the word is still very common as an adjective in american english  usually in compound formations like  auto industry  and  auto the abbreviated form is also used in dutch and german the first working steam-powered  vehicle was designed—and most likely built—by ferdinand verbiest  a flemish member of a jesuit mission in china around 1672.  it was a 65-cm-long  scale-model  toy for the chinese emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a it is not known if verbiest s model was ever cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale,  self-propelled  mechanical vehicle or car in about 1769;  he created a steam-powered  he also constructed two steam tractors for the french army  one of which is preserved in the french national conservatory of arts and his inventions were  however  handicapped by problems with water supply and maintaining steam in 1801,  richard trevithick built and demonstrated his puffing devil road locomotive  believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered  road vehicle  it was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods  and was of little practical use the development of external combustion engines is detailed as part of the history of the car  but often treated separately from the development of true cars  a variety of steam-powered  road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th  century  including steam cars  steam buses  phaetons  and steam rollers  sentiment against them led to the locomotive acts of 1865.in  1807,  nicéphore niépce and his brother claude created what was probably the world s first internal combustion engine  which they called a pyréolophore   but they chose to install it in a boat on the river saone in coincidentally  in 1807  the swiss inventor françois isaac de rivaz designed his own  de rivaz internal combustion engine  and used it to develop the world s first vehicle to be powered by such an engine  the niépces  pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of lycopodium powder  dried spores of the lycopodium plant   finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil  whereas de rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and neither design was very successful  as was the case with others  such as samuel brown  samuel morey  and etienne lenoir with his hippomobile  who each produced vehicles  usually adapted carriages or carts  powered by internal combustion november 1881,  french inventor gustave trouvé demonstrated the first working (three-wheeled)  car powered by electricity at the international exposition of electricity  although several other german engineers  including gottlieb daimler  wilhelm maybach  and siegfried marcus  were working on the problem at about the same time  karl benz generally is acknowledged as the inventor of the modern 1879,  benz was granted a patent for his first engine  which had been designed in 1878.  many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle  his first motorwagen was built in 1885  in mannheim  germany  he was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29  january 1886   under the auspices of his major company  benz   cie   which was founded in 1883).  benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3  july 1886,  and about 25  benz vehicles were sold between 1888  and 1893,  when his first four-wheeler  was introduced along with a model intended for affordability  they also were powered with four-stroke  engines of his own design  emile roger of france  already producing benz engines under license  now added the benz car to his line of products  because france was more open to the early cars  initially more were built and sold in france through roger than benz sold in germany  in august 1888  bertha benz  the wife of karl benz  undertook the first road trip by car  to prove the road-worthiness  of her husband s invention in 1896,  benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion  flat engine  called boxermotor  during the last years of the nineteenth century  benz was the largest car company in the world with 572  units produced in 1899  and  because of its size  benz   cie   became a joint-stock  company  the first motor car in central europe and one of the first factory-made  cars in the world  was produced by czech company nesselsdorfer wagenbau  later renamed to tatra  in 1897,  the präsident automobil daimler and maybach founded daimler motoren gesellschaft  dmg  in cannstatt in 1890,  and sold their first car in 1892  under the brand name daimler  it was a horse-drawn  stagecoach built by another manufacturer  which they retrofitted with an engine of their design  by 1895  about 30  vehicles had been built by daimler and maybach  either at the daimler works or in the hotel hermann  where they set up shop after disputes with their backers  benz  maybach and the daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other s early work  they never worked together  by the time of the merger of the two companies  daimler and maybach were no longer part of dmg  daimler died in 1900  and later that year  maybach designed an engine named daimler-mercedes  that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by emil jellinek  this was a production of a small number of vehicles for jellinek to race and market in his country  two years later  in 1902,  a new model dmg car was produced and the model was named mercedes after the maybach engine  which generated 35  hp  maybach quit dmg shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own  rights to the daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers karl benz proposed co-operation  between dmg and benz   cie  when economic conditions began to deteriorate in germany following the first world war  but the directors of dmg refused to consider it initially  negotiations between the two companies resumed several years later when these conditions worsened and  in 1924  they signed an agreement of mutual interest  valid until the year 2000.  both enterprises standardized design  production  purchasing  and sales and they advertised or marketed their car models jointly  although keeping their respective brands  on 28  june 1926,  benz   cie  and dmg finally merged as the daimler-benz  company  baptizing all of its cars mercedes benz  as a brand honoring the most important model of the dmg cars  the maybach design later referred to as the 1902  mercedes-35  hp  along with the benz name  karl benz remained a member of the board of directors of daimler-benz  until his death in 1929,  and at times his two sons also participated in the management of the company in 1890,  émile levassor and armand peugeot of france began producing vehicles with daimler engines  and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in france  in 1891,  auguste doriot and his peugeot colleague louis rigoulot completed the longest trip by a gasoline-powered  vehicle when their self-designed  and built daimler powered peugeot type 3  completed 2,100  km (1,300  miles  from valentigney to paris and brest and back again  they were attached to the first paris–brest–paris bicycle race  but finished 6  days after the winning cyclist  charles terront the first design for an american car with a gasoline internal combustion engine was made in 1877  by george selden of rochester  new york  selden applied for a patent for a car in 1879,  but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built  after a delay of sixteen years and a series of attachments to his application  on 5  november 1895,  selden was granted a united states patent  u s  patent 549,160)  for a two-stroke  car engine  which hindered  more than encouraged  development of cars in the united states  his patent was challenged by henry ford and others  and overturned in 1911.in  1893,  the first running  gasoline-powered  american car was built and road-tested  by the duryea brothers of springfield  massachusetts  the first public run of the duryea motor wagon took place on 21  september 1893,  on taylor street in metro center the studebaker automobile company  subsidiary of a long-established  wagon and coach manufacturer  started to build cars in and commenced sales of electric vehicles in 1902  and gasoline vehicles in britain  there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success  with thomas rickett even attempting a production run in santler from malvern is recognized by the veteran car club of great britain as having made the first gasoline-powered  car in the country in followed by frederick william lanchester in 1895,  but these were both the first production vehicles in great britain came from the daimler company  a company founded by harry j  lawson in 1896,  after purchasing the right to use the name of the engines  lawson s company made its first car in 1897,  and they bore the name 1892,  german engineer rudolf diesel was granted a patent for a  new rational combustion engine   in 1897,  he built the first diesel steam-,  electric-,  and gasoline-powered  vehicles competed for decades  with gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s.  although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design  only mazda s version of the wankel engine has had more than very limited success.large-scale,  production-line  manufacturing of affordable cars was started by ransom olds in 1901  at his oldsmobile factory in lansing  michigan and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by marc isambard brunel at the portsmouth block mills  england  in 1802.  the assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the u s  by thomas blanchard in 1821,  at the springfield armory in springfield  this concept was greatly expanded by henry ford  beginning in 1913  with the world s first moving assembly line for cars at the highland park ford plant as a result  ford s cars came off the line in fifteen-minute  intervals  much faster than previous methods  increasing productivity eightfold  while using less manpower  from 12.5-man-hours  to 1  hour 33  it was so successful  paint became a bottleneck  only japan black would dry fast enough  forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1913,  until fast-drying  duco lacquer was developed in 1926.  this is the source of ford s apocryphal remark   any color as long as it s in 1914,  an assembly line worker could buy a model t with four months  complex safety procedures—especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about—dramatically reduced the rate of injury  the combination of high wages and high efficiency is called  fordism   and was copied by most major industries  the efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the united states  the assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods in the automotive industry  its success was dominating  and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of ford france and ford britain in 1911,  ford denmark 1923,  ford germany 1925;  in 1921,  citroen was the first native european manufacturer to adopt the production method  soon  companies had to have assembly lines  or risk going broke  by 1930,  250  companies which did not  had of automotive technology was rapid  due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world s attention  key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter   both by charles kettering  for the cadillac motor company in 1910–1911),  independent suspension  and four-wheel  brakes since the 1920s,  nearly all cars have been mass-produced  to meet market needs  so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design  it was alfred p  sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company  called the general motors companion make program  so that buyers could  move up  as their fortunes improved reflecting the rapid pace of change  makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range  for example  in the 1930s,  lasalles  sold by cadillac  used cheaper mechanical parts made by oldsmobile  in the 1950s,  chevrolet shared hood  doors  roof  and windows with pontiac  by the 1990s,  corporate powertrains and shared platforms  with interchangeable brakes  suspension  and other parts  were common  even so  only major makers could afford high costs  and even companies with decades of production  such as apperson  cole  dorris  haynes  or premier  could not manage  of some two hundred american car makers in existence in 1920,  only 43  survived in 1930,  and with the great depression  by 1940,  only 17  of those were europe  much the same would happen  morris set up its production line at cowley in 1924,  and soon outsold ford  while beginning in 1923  to follow ford s practice of vertical integration  buying hotchkiss  engines   wrigley  gearboxes   and osberton  radiators   for instance  as well as competitors  such as wolseley  in 1925,  morris had 41%  of total british car production  most british small-car  assemblers  from abbey to xtra  had gone under  citroen did the same in france  coming to cars in 1919;  between them and other cheap cars in reply such as renault s 10cv  and peugeot s 5cv,  they produced 550,000  cars in 1925,  and mors  hurtu  and others could not germany s first mass-manufactured  car  the opel 4ps  laubfrosch  tree frog   came off the line at russelsheim in 1924,  soon making opel the top car builder in germany  with 37.5%  of the japan  car production was very limited before world war ii  only a handful of companines were producing vehicles in limited numbers  and these were small  three-wheeled  for commercial uses  like daihatsu  or were the result of partnering with european companies  like isuzu building the wolseley a-9  in 1922.  mitsubishi was also partnered with fiat and built the mitsubishi model a based on a fiat vehicle  toyota  nissan  suzuki  mazda  and honda began as companies producing non-automotive  products before the war  switching to car production during the 1950s.  kiichiro toyoda s decision to take toyoda loom works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become toyota motor corporation  the largest automobile manufacturer in the world  subaru  meanwhile  was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as fuji heavy industries  as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation most cars in use in the 2010s  are propelled by an internal combustion engine  fueled by the deflagration  rather than detonation  combustion of hydrocarbon fossil fuels  mostly gasoline  petrol  and diesel  as well as some autogas and cng  hydrocarbon fuels cause air pollution and contribute to climate change and global rapidly increasing oil prices  concerns about oil dependence  tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars  efforts to improve or replace existing technologies include the development of hybrid vehicles  plug-in  electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles  vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel  vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries  cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines  but these are impractical for common use oil consumption in the twentieth and twenty-first  centuries has been abundantly pushed by car growth  the 1985–2003  oil glut even fuelled the sales of low-economy  vehicles in oecd countries  the bric countries are adding to this consumption  in december 2009  china was briefly the largest car are equipped with controls used for driving  passenger comfort and safety  normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands  and occasionally by voice on 2000s-era  cars  these controls include a steering wheel  pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car s speed  and  in a manual transmission car  a clutch pedal   a shift lever or stick for changing gears  and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights  ventilation and other functions  modern cars  controls are now standardised  such as the location for the accelerator and brake  but this was not always the case  controls are evolving in response to new technologies  for example the electric car and the integration of mobile communications since the car was first invented  its controls have become fewer and simpler through automation  for example  all cars once had a manual controls for the choke valve  clutch  ignition timing  and a crank instead of an electric starter  however new controls have also been added to vehicles  making them more complex  examples include air conditioning  navigation systems  and in car entertainment  another trend is the replacement of physical knob and switches for secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as bmw s idrive and ford s myford touch  another change is that while early cars  pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle  in the 2010s,  cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls cars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights  these include headlights  which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users  so that the vehicle can be used at night  in some jurisdictions  daytime running lights  red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied  amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver  white-coloured  reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car  and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing   and on some vehicles  additional lights  e g   side marker lights  to increase the visibility of the car  interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers  some vehicles also have a trunk light and  more rarely  an engine compartment light in the united states   from 1975  to 1980,  average weight dropped from 1,842  to 1,464  kg (4,060  to 3,228  lb   likely in response to rising gasoline prices  and new fuel efficiency the average new car weighed 1,461  kg (3,221  lb  in 1987  but 1,818  kg (4,009  lb  in 2010,  due to modern steel

cause of injury-related  deaths mary ward became one of the first documented car fatalities in 1869  in parsonstown  and henry bliss one of the united states  first pedestrian car casualties in 1899  in new york there are now standard tests for safety in new cars  such as the euroncap and the us ncap and insurance-industry-backed  tests by the insurance institute for highway safety road traffic is becoming ever safer  in part due to efforts by the government to implement safety features in cars  e g   seat belts  air bags  etc    reduce unsafe driving practices  e g   speeding  drinking and driving and texting and driving  and make road design more safe by adding features such as speed bumps  which reduce vehicle speed  and roundabouts  which reduce the likelihood of a head-on-collision

smaller  more fuel-efficient  cars  or to not drive  on average  today s cars are about 75  percent recyclable  and using recycled steel helps reduce energy use and in the united states congress  federally mandated fuel efficiency standards have been debated regularly  passenger car standards have not risen above the 27.5  miles per us gallon (8.6  l/100  km  33.0  mpg‑imp  standard set in

evolving due to connected car autonomous vehicles  also known as driverless cars  already exist in prototype  such as the google driverless car   and are expected to be commercially available around 2020.  according to urban designer and futurist michael e  arth  driverless electric vehicles—in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work  travel  and pleasure—could reduce the world s 800  million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few this would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers  which are not in use and parked 90%  of the time  would be traded for public self-driving  taxis that would be in near constant use  this would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need—a bus could come for a group of people  a limousine could come for a special night out  and a segway could come for a short trip down the street for one person  children could be chauffeured in supervised safety  duis would no longer exist  and 41,000  lives could be saved each year in the us have been several projects aiming to develop a car on the principles of open design  an approach to designing in which the plans for the machinery and systems are publicly shared  often without monetary compensation  the projects include oscar  riversimple  through and none of the projects have reached significant success in terms of developing a car as a whole both from hardware and software perspective and no mass production ready open-source  based design have been introduced as of late 2009.  some car hacking through on-board

and commercial vehicles were produced 2007,  a total of 71.9  million new cars were sold worldwide  22.9  million in europe  21.4  million in the asia-pacific  region  19.4  million in the usa and canada  4.4  million in latin america  2.4  million in the middle east and 1.4  million in the markets in north america and japan were stagnant  while those in south america and other parts of asia grew strongly  of the major markets  china  russia  brazil and india saw the most rapid growth about 250  million vehicles are in use in the united states  around the world  there were about 806  million cars and light trucks on the road in 2007;  they burn over 260  billion us gallons (980,000,000  m3)  of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly  the numbers are increasing rapidly  especially in china and in the opinion of some  urban transport systems based around the car have proved unsustainable  consuming excessive energy  affecting the health of populations  and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investments  many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive the sustainable transport movement focuses on solutions to these problems in 2008,  with rapidly rising oil prices  industries such as the automotive industry  are experiencing a combination of pricing pressures from raw material costs and changes in consumer buying habits  the industry is also facing increasing external competition from the public transport sector  as consumers re-evaluate  their private vehicle roughly half of the us s fifty-one  light vehicle plants are projected to permanently close in the coming years  with the loss of another 200,000  jobs in the sector  on top of the 560,000  jobs lost this combined with robust growth in china  in 2009,  this resulted in china becoming the largest car producer and market in the world  china 2009  sales had increased to 13.6  million  a significant increase from one million of domestic car sales in since then however  even in china and other bric countries  the automotive production is again alternatives for some aspects of car use include public transit such as buses  trolleybuses  trains  subways  tramways light rail  cycling  and walking  car-share  arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly popular  in the us and for example  in the us  some car-sharing  services have experienced double-digit  growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006  and 2007.  services like car sharing offering a residents to  share  a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested bike-share  systems have been tried in some european cities  including copenhagen and amsterdam  similar programs have been experimented with in a number of us additional individual modes of transport  such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially term motorcar has formerly also been used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage  these locomotive cars were often used on suburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad
