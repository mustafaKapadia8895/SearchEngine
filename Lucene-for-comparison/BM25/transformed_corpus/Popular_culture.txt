established by the interbellum quotation to verify from the end of world war ii  following major cultural and social changes brought by mass media innovations  the meaning of popular culture began to overlap with those of mass culture  media culture  image culture  consumer culture  and culture for mass social and cultural changes in the united states were a pioneer in this with respect to other western countries the abbreviated form  pop  for popular  as in pop music  dates from the late although terms  pop  and  popular  are in some cases used interchangeably  and their meaning partially

represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways  for example  certain currents of pop culture may originate from   or diverge into  a subculture  representing perspectives with which the mainstream popular culture has only limited familiarity  items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public  important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the german researcher ronald daus  who studies the impact of extra-european  cultures

1990s,  the distinction between mass media and word-of-mouth  has become blurred although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the commercial element  the public has its own tastes and it may not always embrace every cultural or subculture item sold  moreover  beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture spread by word-of-mouth,  and become modified in the process in the same manner that folklore evolves a television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air,  cable television  or internet television  other than a

corporate entity  as opposed to specific products or culture-although  big  mercurial  and slippery to define-is  really an umbrella term that covers anything currently in fashion  all or most of whose ingredients are familiar to the public-at-large.  the new dances are a perfect example    pop art itself may mean little to the average man  but its vocabulary   is always familiar it is tempting to confuse pop music with popular music  the new grove dictionary of music and musicians  the musicologist s ultimate reference resource  identifies popular music as the music since industrialization in the 1800s  that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class  this would include an extremely wide range of music from vaudeville and minstrel shows to
