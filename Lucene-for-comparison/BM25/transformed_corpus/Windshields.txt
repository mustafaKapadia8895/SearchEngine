 windshield -  wikipediathe windshield  north america  or windscreen  commonwealth english  of an aircraft  car  bus  motorbike or tram is the front window  modern windshields are generally made of laminated safety glass  a type of treated glass  which consists of two  typically  curved sheets of glass with a plastic layer laminated between them for safety  and are bonded into the window frame  motorbike windshields are often made of high-impact  polycarbonate or acrylic plastic windshields protect the vehicle s occupants from wind and flying debris such as dust  insects  and rocks  and provide an aerodynamically formed window towards the front  uv coating may be applied to screen out harmful ultraviolet radiation  however  this is usually unnecessary since most auto windshields are made from laminated safety glass  the majority of uv-b  is absorbed by the glass itself  and any remaining uv-b  together with most of the uv-a  is absorbed by the pvb bonding motorbikes their main function is to shield the rider from wind  though not as completely as in a car  whereas on sports and racing motorcycles the main function is reducing drag when the rider assumes the optimal aerodynamic configuration with his or her body in unison with the machine  and does not shield the rider from wind when sitting upright early windshields were made of ordinary window glass  but that could lead to serious injuries in the event of a crash  a series of crashes led up to the development of stronger windshields  the most notable example of this is the pane vs  ford case of 1917  that decided against pane in that he was only injured through reckless needed  they were replaced with windshields made of toughened glass and were fitted in the frame using a rubber or neoprene seal  the hardened glass shattered into many mostly harmless fragments when the windshield broke  these windshields  hovever  could shatter from a simple stone chip  in 1919,  henry ford solved the problem of flying debris by using the new french technology of glass laminating  windshields made using this process were two layers of glass with a cellulose inner layer  this inner layer held the glass together when it fractured  between 1919  and 1929,  ford ordered the use of laminated glass on all of his glued-in  windshields contribute to the vehicle s rigidity  but the main force for innovation has historically been the need to prevent injury from sharp glass fragments  almost all nations now require windshields to stay in one piece even if broken  except if pierced by a strong force  properly installed automobile windshields are also essential to safety  along with the roof of the car  they provide protection to the vehicle s occupants in the case of a roll-over  needed  today’s windshields are a safety device just like seat belts and airbags  the installation of the auto glass is done with an automotive grade urethane designed specifically for automobiles  the adhesive creates a molecular bond between the glass and the vehicle  if the adhesive bond fails at any point on the glass it can reduce the effectiveness of the air bag and substantially compromise the structural integrity of the needed  the urethane sealant is protected from uv in sunlight by a band of dark dots around the edge of the windshield  the darkened edge transitions to the clear windshield with smaller dots to minimize thermal stress in manufacturing  the same band of darkened dots is often expanded around the rear view mirror to act as a many places  laws restrict the use of heavily tinted glass in vehicle windshields  generally  laws specify the maximum level of tint permitted  some vehicles have noticeably more tint in the uppermost part of the windshield to block sunglare in aircraft windshields  an electric current is applied through a conducting layer of tin iv  oxide to generate heat to prevent icing  a similar system for automobile windshields  introduced on ford vehicles as  quickclear  in europe   instaclear  in north america  in the 1980s  and through the early 1990s,  used this conductive metallic coating applied to the inboard side of the outer layer of glass  other glass manufacturers utilize a grid of micro-thin  wires to conduct the heat  these systems are more typically utilized by european auto manufacturers such as jaguar and porsche the use of thermal glass prevents some navigation systems from functioning correctly  as the embedded metal blocks the satellite signal the rf signal tends to flow along the metal wires or layer so very little radiation can pass  this can be resolved by using an external antenna  mobile telephones can also have problems  thermal glass typically allows only 0.0001  (1‰,  or one per mille  of the signal to pass  whereas a concrete wall with rebars allows up to 0.0100  (10%,  or 100‰)  of the signal to pass the term windshield is used generally throughout north america  the term windscreen is the usual term in the british isles and australasia for all vehicles  in the us windscreen refers to the mesh or foam placed over a microphone to minimize wind noise  while a windshield refers to the front window of a car  in the uk  the terms are reversed  although generally  the foam screen is referred to as a microphone shield  and not a windshield sports or racing cars would sometimes have aero screens  which were small semi-circular  or rectangular windshields  these were often mounted in pairs behind a foldable flat aero screens are usually less than 20  cm (8  in  in height  they are known as aero screens because they only deflect the wind  the twin aeroscreen setup  often called brooklands  was popular among older sports and modern cars in vintage style a wiperless windshield is a windshield that uses a mechanism other than wipers to remove snow and rain from the windshield  the concept car acura tl features a wiperless windshield using a series of jet nozzles in the cowl to blow pressurized air onto the windshield according to the us national windshield repair association  many types of stone damage can be successfully repaired  whether the windshield can be repaired always depends upon four factors  the size  type  depth and location of the of cracks up to 6.1  cm (2.4  in  is within permissible limits  automobile glass with more severe damage needs to be replaced  however  this is dependent on local laws  unless it goes to the edge of the window  it would then compromise the structural integrity of the windshield circular bullseyes  linear cracks  crack chips  dings  pits and star-shaped  breaks can be repaired without removing the glass  eliminating the risk of leaking or bonding problems sometimes associated with replacement some damages are very difficult to repair  or cannot be repaired in cracked windshield repair  air is removed from the damaged area on the windshield with a specified vacuum injection pump  then using the injection pump  clear adhesive resin is injected to replace the air in the windshield crack  the resin is then cured with an ultraviolet light  when done properly  the damaged area’s strength is restored  as is 90–95%  of the clarity windshields that cannot be repaired have to be replaced  replacement of a windshield typically takes less than an hour  to ensure the vehicle is safe to drive  time values called the safe drive away time have been established  windshields which have been replaced must cure or bond sufficiently until they are able to withstand the forces of a crash  knowing the minimum time needed to cure the glass bonding adhesives is therefore important  this safe drive away time  sdat  or minimum drive away time  mdat  refers to the time required until a windshield installation or glass replacement is considered safe to drive criteria are specified in u s  federal motor vehicle safety standards 212/208   see fmvss  to ensure the reliability of adhesive systems  typically the sdat is verified with crash tests as well as with high speed laboratory test methods consumers may be unaware that the mdat or sdat time is focused on safety and not necessarily on the quality  durability  or warranty of the installation  care must be taken not to drive the vehicle prior to the sdat mdat  if a vehicle is released to be driven before the sdat and the adhesive used to set the new windshield has not had appropriate cure time  the occupants will not be properly protected in the event of a deploy at speeds up to 200  mph (320  km h  89  m s  and in some cases exert tremendous force on the windshield  occupants can impact the airbag just 50  ms after initial depending on vehicle design  airbag deployment and or occupant impact into the airbag may increase forces on the windshield  dramatically in some cases  forces of occupants on the airbags -  and hence the potential forces on the windshield -  are lower for belted as consequence  adhesive suppliers usually inform their customers about the level of security achieved:1)  example  security exceeding fmvss 212/208  belted2)  example  security exceeding fmvss 212/208  the advent of quick cure adhesives  mobile windshield replacements have become more prevalent  often the temperature and humidity cannot be controlled for mobile installations  for most common glass adhesives the ideal environment is 70  °f (21  °c  and 50%  humidity  variations from the ideal curing environment can increase the time needed for a sufficiently safe bond to form  a controlled environment always ensures the performance and safety of the windshield installation if not properly cured  the adhesive bond could fail during a crash  allowing occupants to be injured  ejected  or causing other harm  because of the variables and difficulties involved in mobile windshield replacement  many vehicle manufacturers do not recommend this method of installation waste disposal of laminated glass is no longer permitted in landfill in most european countries as the end of life vehicles directive  elv  is implemented  a by surrey university and pilkington glass proposes that waste laminated glass be placed into a separating device such as a rolling mill where the glass is fragmented and the larger cullet is mechanically detached from the inner film  the application of heat then melts the laminating plastic  usually polyvinyl butyral  pvb  enabling both the glass and the interior film to be recycled  the pvb recycling process is a simple procedure of melting and reshaping it manufacturing processes reference guide  robert
