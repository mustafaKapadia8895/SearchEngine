 piracy in the atlantic world -  wikipediapiracy was a phenomenon that was not limited to the caribbean region  golden age pirates roamed off the coast of north america  africa and the caribbean pirates and sailors are important in understanding how the atlantic world looked and worked  defying traditional alliances  attacking and capturing merchant vessels of all nations  pirates wreaked havoc on an emerging economic system  disrupted trade routes and created a crisis within an increasingly important system of trade centered on the atlantic they were ready and willing participants in the exchange of people  ideas  and commodities around the atlantic basin affecting the creation and destruction of routes along the middle passage were one of the main cogs in establishing what is known as capitalism today  for pirates in the atlantic world  trade routes are fortuitous  because of the vast wealth they supply in the way of cargo that moved along the middle passage  from 1715  to 1728,  pirate activity created problems for merchant ships along the trade routes  thus halting growth during that as piracy along the middle passage increased  so did the need for owners of the merchant vessels to insure the cargo on board their ships  because not only was there threat of loss from natural disaster  there was the chance the cargo could be lost to plundering pirates   the genius of insurance   in the way it contributes to finance capitalism  is the insistence that the real test of something s value comes not at the moment it is made or exchanged  but at the moment it is lost or are often equated in the modern mind with privateers and buccaneers  but neither label accurately describes piracy during the early eighteenth century  each of these terms describes men who loot ships or settlements  the difference lies in the amount of societal acceptance that these men were afforded buccaneers attacked spanish settlements in the caribbean late in the seventeenth century  while the spanish were certainly not happy with these events  other countries such as the english did not mind being stronger in the region due to these the word buccaneer  a word derived from a process of curing meat  referred specifically to these men conducting these attacks  which ended well before 1700.privateers  were sanctioned by their respective governments to raid enemy vessels  the colonization of the atlantic saw many conflicts among the french  spanish and english  raiding by privateers was one way to gain an advantage  the captains of these ships were given letters of marque by their governments  intended to validate all actions against the pirates of the early eighteenth century  however  were men who acted on their own apart from official political sanction  pirates were very specific  unauthorized entities who worked outside the more socially accepted scenarios and did not discriminate when conducting their the act of piracy was criminal  laws against piracy were often very strict  with charges and punishments escalating in attempts to curb piratical 194  but many braved the consequences of being caught if it meant a life lived more freely pirates  during what is called the  golden age of piracy  of the late seventeenth century and early eighteenth century operated on a truly global golden age of piracy  is a term used by historians to refer to the most widespread increase of  sea on record  although scholars agree that there was a boom in raiding and pillaging activities in the early eighteenth century  there are various schools of thought regarding the length of time that was the golden age  the shortest amount of time that is agreed upon is from around 1715  to 1725.  the signing of the treaty of utrecht ended the war of spanish succession  ending the authorized privateering that was a part of the war and marking the beginning of the golden age of xx–xxi another group holds that the golden age was from around 1690  to about the longest definition of the golden age runs from 1650  to 1726,  to include the buccaneers and other piracy endeavors.european-based  piracy of the modern era began in the  atlantic triangle   this common area of oceangoing commerce between seville   cadiz  the azores islands  and the northwest coast of africa  encompassing madeira and the canary islands was haunted by both european  as well as the berber coast pirates of north africa throughout the sixteenth century  as consistent trade increased between spain and portugal and the east and west indies  respectively  so did piracy  what spain and portugal would call piracy was often sponsored by  even if only at times marginally  monarchs such as elizabeth i and edward vi of england  most popular in this era of privateers was francis drake  drake raided spanish settlements and shipping in the south sea shores of present-day  peru  chile  brazil  and venezuela  along the coasts of central america  this era was notable for beginning somewhat regular long-term  visits to the west coast of the americas and further to the east indies  often after stopping in west africa to loot slaving ships or towns  dutch merchants were active in the caribbean  mining salt and dyewoods on the coast of brazil  this activity lead to dozens of raids along the west coast of the americas and to the formation of the west india company which had semi-legal  standing as privateers  this large continuous harassment incensed spain and put their the inhabitants in fear  by the turn of the seventeenth century this vast expansion of the dutch had formed colonies in the east indies and soon they started feeling as well the wrath of piracy  shortly buccaneers followed in the seventeenth century  these bandits mostly raided land settlements  they were  embittered dutch sailors    abandoned french colonists    abused english  scots  and irish 9–12,  49,  51,  57,  37–45,  64–66,  84,  70–71,  96most  of the pirates known during this period originated from europe  much of the known pirate activity that took place in the northern atlantic was along the eastern seaboard of canada and the us mainland  from newfoundland to the florida newfoundland fisheries were known as recruiting areas for pirates in the early eighteenth black bart roberts had a run-in  off the coast of newfoundland as well  there he captured samuel cary  who gave an in-depth  account of the event to a boston new york was a popular place for pirates to unload their 211  one of the best known events is blackbeard s blockade of charleston s port africa was intimately tied to the economy of the caribbean  responsible for fueling the sailors that pirates preyed on  the sugar plantations of the caribbean  and the mainland colonies of spain and britain  traffic from africa was routinely targeted by on numerous occasions  mutinous slave ship crews turned pirate  bartholomew roberts wreaked havoc for traders of all goods on the west coast of one of the earliest rumored places where pirates collected was on the island of madagascar  off the east coast of africa  this was their base of operations for their pecking of the mogul empire  here they could prey on the successes of the east india companies while being a world away from any authority  these are the same outlaws that were plundering the west indies  the english pirate avery  or henry every plundered a mogul ship  gaining immense avery was said to have settled on madagascar and was never heard from again  though it was rumored he retired in ireland  some writers speculate that this event put in motion a series of events that would help lead to the multitude of laws passed for decades to capitalism developed as an economic system in early modern europe  overseas colonies became increasingly important in the atlantic trade labor-intensive  colonial plantations generated a need to find a stable  long-term  labor force  indentured servants posed a problem in that they had legal rights and could eventually become a competing force  the advantages of slave labor in comparison with the disadvantages of indentured servitude contributed to the growth of the european slave pirates were a bane to english attempts to gain supremacy on the african coast  they disrupted the flow of labor and capital by attacking  capturing and sometimes destroying slave vessels  pirate captains often absorbed captured slaves into their crews  and blacks  both african and african american made up a substantial part of the pirate as long as pirates were actively disrupting the slave trade  they posed a threat to england s dominance in the atlantic slave trade middle passage was just as much a part of life in the atlantic as was the merchant shipping of goods  many european powers had ties to the slaving trade by at least the eighteenth century  countries like portugal  sweden  netherlands  france  and england all had outposts on the african coast  slavers would conduct their business with the larger african tribes who would buy weapons from the europeans and in turn use them to collect members of other tribes to sell to slave once in the hands of a slaver  the slave represented a substantial investment as ian baucom suggests  by the insuring of slaves purchased  some european cities such as liverpool would become successful from operating in this trade system  and would drive the free markets of slavery to handle as much business as was 71with  slaving remaining an open and competitive business  there existed both what rediker calls a  fort trade  and a  ship trade   slaves were kidnapped and brought to forts where they would be held by the local authorities until bought and shipped out  while the ship trade refers to captains making stops along the african coast at points where there was not a european presence to gather up the slaves themselves  they would also stock up on the necessary provisions for the middle passage at these stops the captives were not the only ones who were mistreated on slave ships  as rediker points out the lash  operated without regard to race  age  gender  law  or humanity  many of the sailors were beaten mercilessly when they would refuse to beat the slaves as harshly as the captain wanted or at all  a sailor could make roughly one to one and a half thousand dollars in current pay  which back in the eighteenth century was a fairly large sum of money for a single 151,  225–226,  228marcus  rediker argues pirates followed a lucrative trade and sought bases for their depredations in areas that were  distant from the seats of imperial power   pirate havens such as the bahamian islands began to attract pirates by the hundreds because no government matthew frick also argues "near-autonomous  nature of a feral city  along with  geographic position accessible to the world s oceans  creates a perfect place from which to conduct acts of piracy  frick also states that pirates are not likely to rule over much land the farther one moves away from the beach and even the smallest portion of a coastal city that tolerates the existence of pirates enables pirates to establish a "toe-hold  on land that will spread cancer-like"  to the water surrounding it   once on land and established  pirate havens become a scene of fear and lawlessness controlled by the pirates who inhabit it and  governments are perpetually at odds  on how to rid the pirates from their land bases without the risk of  excessive collateral damage  and loss of innocent they  left behind little or no property and few documents by their own most of the pirates were from england  scotland  ireland  and wales  of that population approximately one-quarter  were linked to british port cities like bristol  liverpool  and plymouth  approximately one-quarter  of the populations were associated with men of the west indies and north america  the others  came from other parts of the world such as holland  france  portugal  denmark  belgium  sweden  and several parts of  became one of the most common male occupations  for africans and african-americans  in the early 19th  century  black sailors filled about one-fifth  of the population at various sea havens  becoming a pirate offered a choice of other occupations for african-americans  that could improve their 2,  69   africans and african americans both free and enslaved were numerous and active on board pirate some chose piracy because the only other option was some black pirates were escaped slaves  boarding a pirate vessel became a way to escape to the atlantic north undetected  escaped slave frederick douglass disguised himself in  sailor s garb   and  was able to travel undetected to the north and his as crewmen  blacks made up part of the  pirate they also worked the seafaring trades of  ship building  caulking  and sail important factor of turning to piracy is one s social class  pirates typically composed themselves from amongst the lowest social classes  they were just men that saw piracy as a lucrative opportunity in which they had little to a simple attraction for the lower social class was money  these  dispossessed proletarians  sought the wealth they needed to live and an escape from the dreadful working conditions they had to also represented a counterculture that attracted the working class  living outside the society that oppressed them  presented an ability to attain liberty at as pirates  men could organize a social world apart from the authoritarian environment that composed of mercantilism and imperial order  and use it to attack that authority s property  life at sea made available a singular opportunity of freedom that the lower social classes could acquire  piracy meant to forsake  fundamental social rules  escape conventional authority  manufacture their own power   and accumulate a considerable amount of 136the  occupational background of the people that turned to piracy  came overwhelmingly from seafaring pirates customarily had experience in labor as merchant seamen  sailors of the royal navy  privateers  and sometimes as it was beneficial to have experience within these occupations because life at sea was hard and dangerous  seafaring skills would ease the difficulty of pirate life and provided occupational advancement whilst on vast majority of pirates also came from the crews of captured merchant vessels  frequently  captured merchantmen would volunteer to join the pirate crew  the captors were already  familiar with the single-sex  community of work and the rigors of life-and  death-at  sea   they saw little difference between merchant and pirate life  understanding that their other option was death  the men usually volunteered to join ranks  this favored the pirates because they preferred volunteers  this preference was reasoned by the fact that they were more likely to create social cohesion amongst the pirates had been indentured servants  especially the fourteen-year  variety   a fourteen-year  indenture  meant that they had been transported to the colonies in punishment for crimes committed in transferring from one life of crime for another was painless according to gilje and data collected at the time of the american revolution  the ages of pirates ranged from fourteen to fifty years old  more than half of the population were in their twenties  the average age was 25,  with less than 20  percent of seamen under twenty years old  most of the men within that percentage were eighteen or nineteen  at the time  a ship may contain a boy of ten or twelve  but it was very uncommon  on these occasions  it was the parent or guardian that made the arrangements and would sign the boy away to a ship  approximately 20  percent of the populations were men in their thirties  forties  and fifties  this small percentage was a commonality because by the time a man reached his thirties  he likely moved on to a  new occupation ashore  turned to fishing  labored on the docks  or had been lost at 27aside  from the criminal world of piracy  there was also the emerging colonies in north america  while nearly as dangerous and deadly as becoming a pirate  colonialism in the americas offered those who dared  a chance at changing their socioeconomic place  in many ways  the freedom of colonialism and piracy are very parallel  both are risky and dangerous  and gave an individual the chance to make many decisions of their own tukuiy argues mutiny was common on long voyages and often discipline was brutal if captains heard discussions of revolt even though these actions were a serious offense due to the  direct assault on the order – thus the status quo – on a seagoing vessel   turley also argues that the  temptations to turn pirate  centered on the opportunities for employment and profit  and therefore was a result of when the  wars ceased  sailors faced either remaining idle or making smaller wages  or ultimately turn pirate other mutineers were  privateer crews  who became  frustrated by the lack of booty  or even became greedy or were unhappy with their 25,  37  these temptations for mutiny  according to rediker  grew from an  array of resistances against such concentrated authority  and the sailors developed an understanding of the importance of equality  however  also according to marcus rediker  only one third of all mutinies at sea led to and "anti-authoritarianism"  was cemented into the mutineers core values and all of these beliefs would influence the decision to turn pirate and how they would conduct themselves in contrast to the egalitarian belief towards mutiny  peter leeson argues  the  prospect of sufficient gain  may influence a sailor  piracy could pay extremely well sometimes better than privateering  a pirate could enjoy every penny of the ship s "ill-gotten  booty   another argument against the egalitarian idea of mutiny that leeson suggests is that the pirate was as "self-interested  as anyone else  and  given the opportunity  would ultimately  take ten times as many shares  as his fellow pirates if in fact they could get away with 68state  sponsored  or military impressment was entirely different in the atlantic world when compared to impressment in the world of piracy  according to paul gilje  impressment was used by england as a way to deny liberty to those who called the colonies home  while the manpower would be welcome on the ship  the more important goal of england exerting its power over people it once had rule over was purely for political ships would often impress those who had skills that were deemed to be beneficial for the running of a successful ship  although this was not standard policy early on in the golden age of piracy  by the early 1720s  pirate ships began to take on more impressed hands because of lack of seamen willing to join of their own when blackbeard captured the french frigate la concorde and renamed her the queen anne s revenge he forced the three surgeons on board  carpenters and a cook to remain with his pirate obvious answer as to why a sailor would become a pirate is for the potentially enormous monetary gain  these gains were impossible to achieve in the navy or working on merchant while many pirates were caught and punished by the state  untold numbers disappeared  presumably with their newly acquired 340,  357another  reason that piracy may have appealed to some is that the pirate ship freed them from the hierarchical command structure  often enforced with violence  found in the navy and on merchant still others may have become pirates to continue living in a homosocial world wherein they could practice their preferred possibly a sailor weighed all of these issues when deciding whether to become a pirate pirates did not have the luxury of building their ships  they were as a result  a pirate captain had to be on the lookout for a vessel that would serve his purpose and procure the ship without harming it in such a way as to make it unfit for service  there is consensus among scholars that pirates would use both small vessels like a sloop or a full-rigged  pinnace  as well as the larger slave ships  but not as often   and on rare occasions the along these lines  the naval historian david cordingly categorized pirate attacks that had been reported along the north american seabord between 1710–1730.  by the numbers of recorded attacks  with an overwhelming 55%  involving sloops  25%  in the larger ships  10%  in brigs and brigantines  5%  in schooners  3%  in open sail-less  boats  and 2%  in ships certainly had advantages in the caribbean and along coastal waterways  they could be careened much easier and faster than the larger vessels  which is a great advantage when a pirate ship could not pull into a dry dock or take long stretches of time to perform maintenance  small vessels also had shallow drafts and could hide  among sandbanks  creeks  and estuaries   where larger ships could the smaller vessels also had a speed advantage over shorter distances than the larger ships of the age  the ratio of displacement to sail capacity was high on small ships  meaning it was easier to bring the boat up to speed fast and produce more speed with less sail  small vessels made up the bulk of the pirate fleet in the west indies and the atlantic for these reasons  among the favored were the single mast sloops and all of the advantages of a small ship  there were drawbacks that could sway captains to look to larger vessels  a sloop or a ship of similar size could not carry a large enough crew to take on bigger prizes by boarding and couldn t carry enough firepower to force submission or fight it out with larger foes  it was also limited in the amount of cargo it could carry  in terms of firepower  anything the size of a sloop would not carry more than fourteen guns  with the french sloop s carrying six guns or 55  conversely some of the largest pirate ships like bartholomew roberts flagship the royal fortune sported forty-two  pirate crews would capture or buy a small ship to begin with and then  trade up  to larger ones  however changing ships many times was not the norm and most crews would stick with one or two a pirate would make the switch from a small to large vessel for the advantages a small ship could not provide or to replace a ship that was damaged or needed such extensive repairs that could not be done by the crew  when a ship was captured  it had to be converted into a vessel suitable for the pirates needs  this meant knocking down cabin walls and lowering the forecastle to create a flush deck  allowing greater utilization of deck space in engagements and storage of armaments  any unnecessary decorations or structures would be stripped off and as many guns as possible were what was left when they were finished was a sleek  armed to the teeth ship with as much thought to speed and efficiency as possible it was not easy to capture an english or french "man-of-war"   see  ship of the line    but pirates would sometimes come across large ships that could be easily converted for use  slave ships  these were full rigged  three mast giants  a slave ship loaded down with human cargo and a small crew was easy prey for pirates who wanted to take her or strip everything of an example of this is the pirate capture of the princes galley  a slaver heading to the caribbean  the pirates pursued and caught the galley  firing their guns to slow and stop the slave ship  eventually they pulled up alongside and took the gold  gunpowder  weapons  and slaves and sailed lawrence e  babits  joshua b  howard and matthew brenckle propose that pirate weaponry might include weapons of several nationalities and sizes and pirates might be presumed to have a variety of weapons  which could have been captured as they upgraded their vessel and personal weapons  pirates also may have  shifted weaponry from one vessel to another  to create a  more powerful for example  blackbeard s flagship  the queen anne s revenge  was discovered in late this vessel was originally mastered by henry bostock (1717)  and captured by blackbeard on december 5,  and what was found on it was a  smaller two cannon exhibited inscriptions   which revealed that one was manufactured in england  and the other in wayne r  lusardi argues there is  considerable reasonable doubt  for the ships identification and blackbeard s flagship  and if it is queen anne s revenge  the  artifact assemblage does not reflect  in any way a  distinctly piratical material culture   lusardi also states the idea of a pirate leaving small arms and ammunition on a grounded vessel is perplexing  yet  many abandoned items occur in the archaeological since then thirty one cannon have been identified and more than 250,000  artifacts have been the cannon are of different origins such as  swedish  english and possibly french  and of different sizes as would be expected with a colonial pirate pirates also used  bags of shot  or langrage more than men-of-war  did because they were made up easily and this was certainly used on the 1717  whydah  which was a  vessel positively identified as a there are a few differences in weaponry between pirates and men-of-war  but one in particular are hand grenades which were  hollow cannonballs filled with black powder  and  pierced with a circular hole  in which a  bamboo tube was inserted  to serve as a  conduit for the grenades were also explained by defoe as  case bottles fill d with powder  with  shot  slugs  and pieces of lead or iron  with a quick  match at the end of it  presently ran into the  bottle to the others argue that any suggested pirate ship or pirate artifact models includes precisely those items that an armed merchantman would have  including a  mix of cannon of different sizes   often from different nations  loaded with  shot designed to damage a vessel s rigging and personnel   also  personal weaponry such as pistols  cutlasses  and knives would be found on any which rediker argues was used to  slit the noses of captives  cut off ears  and used the  knife and gun against their early modern world was replete with various methods of coercion and violence that the state would utilize to impose its will on the lower rungs of society  not only did they lose the control over their lives  but many were subjected to various methods of torture and capital punishment  the institutionalization of these devices cultivated the notion of terror from according to marcus rediker  pirates consciously used terror to accomplish their aims  which varied from physical violence and intimidation to acquiring remunerations  pirates primarily sought easy gains that would allow them to acquire booty while avoiding actual 5,  14the  most pronounced tool pirates had at their disposal when confronting a potential prize was to employ the jolly roger  this symbol was easily identified and the consequences of resistance were equally as well known  sailors knew that  if in their attempt to defend their ship they failed  there was a great possibility that they could be tortured  the renown of pirates was not solely based on or confined to the co-opting  of disciplinary tactics commonly used by the men sailing with official commission  but also due to their habit of  destroying massive amounts of property  with impunity  the desecration of cargo and impairing of ships were standard occurrences in run-ins  with pirates  this is believed to be an  indirect terror  against those the pirates saw as their pirate s characteristic loot included various ships  cargo like slaves or tobacco  there were also very unconventional trophies  such as the wig of a captured captain that the famed pirate walter kennedy once took as the most sought after prize that pirates wanted to capture was  unquestionably  a ship  an ocean vessel that pirates could convert to suit their own needs  pirates would scrape a captured ship for guns  masts  rope  and other supplies that could repair or improve their current vessel  whereas capturing a ship that was more equipped and more powerful than their current craft was the ultimate prize  the issue was that  the pirate could only capture a prize which his vessel could a faster  larger ship with quality weaponry indicated that the pirate could capture other treasures more easily it was not tricky for pirates to steal "deep-sea  sailing ship  especially small  fast  and well-armed  craft such as the most common method of acquiring prizes was capture  capturing was a way in which a pirate could overcome a ship by boarding  gunnery  and possibly intimidation  another method within piracy was the  crime of opportunity   pirates would take their time identifying a target which was easy to capture  the  easy  targets were rare whilst on the high seas  this meant that pirates usually had to lie in wait for the opportunity to capture due to their opportunistic and sometimes patient methodologies  pirates for the most part were able to  capture their prizes without threatening violence was an effective way that pirates were able to plunder ships  and  force disclosure of information about where booty was in the atlantic were affected greatly as pirates captured  plundered  and burned  hundreds of merchant ships  with valuable cargo  however  the goal of the pirate was to rob the ship without fighting or blood 14  pirates faced losses from  resistant victims who hid or destroyed  loot  because of this  pirates made an effort to  maximize profit  and minimize conflict  which could be detrimental to the pirates  the profits  and the ship  though pirates wanted to avoid fighting  they still had to overcome the lost potential of hidden loot  two examples of loss could come when a captured ship s crew  destroyed booty to prevent pirates from taking it  or when a crew would hide  valuables to keep them out pirate hands   pirate theft was not only to gain money  papers with information like the route of government authorities or the location of another vessel with a larger booty were also important  once an item was found  a question of its worth and how to distribute it came next  if an object was  indivisible   then the pirates would sell the object or auction it off  and the profits would then be 106,  109–110,  67like  most people  pirates  were creatures of piracy allowed a crew to benefit from  every penny of its ship s ill-gotten  one s share of the plunder was directly proportionate to a crewman s job aboard the ship  and was outlined in the ship s articles  if a pirate were to take more than his share  hide in times of war  or was dishonest with the crew  he  risked being deposited  somewhere unpleasant and full of hardships  also  ships were not the only things that were able to be plundered  a select group of pirates also attacked a sierra leone fort and several fortresses used for the slave 75,  39,  139because  pirates were outlaw sailors  that does not mean they did not have their own form of government aboard their ships  the wooden world of piracy was very much structured when it came to shipboard relations  suffice to say  this structure did not mimic the oppression of a naval ship sailing under the king s crown   they wanted leadership by example  not leadership by ascribed status and hierarchy   before each voyage  or upon the election of a new captain  compacts were drawn up to which guidelines the ship would function  under these agreements were allocations of authority  distribution of plunder and rations  as well as discipline that were found on ordinary vessels of the seventeenth  and eighteenth century were found on pirate ships  they were a necessary part of working together efficiently to survive the perils of the failure of captains and other officers to condescend to seamen could result in the desire for the crew to mutiny  thus challenging the officers  right to deference  the late 18th  century s challenges to monarchical and aristocratic power structures bled over into shipboard were mostly former merchant seamen  or at least men who had sailed on vessels legitimately before turning to piracy  as a result  a pirate ship still had the usual terminology found on merchant ships  but the role each ranking sailor would play on the pirate ship was not the 91  a pirate ship still had a captain of the vessel  as the economist peter leeson argues  pirate captains were democratically elected by the entire crew  this was not a lifelong title and had less power than the merchant captain  as leeson provides evidence of pirate captains being removed from the position  in one case thirteen captains were removed during one voyage  for not performing at the level that was expected of them or for overstepping their bounds of the pirate captain had absolute command when pursuing a vessel or in military engagements  otherwise he was another member of the check the power of the captain even further  the crew would elect a quartermaster to make sure the men received the necessary rations and equal distribution of the he would also  adjudicate crew member conflicts   and  administer this was usually an experienced seaman who the crew trusted and knew leeson further states that a pirate captain could not take any action without the support of the one such was hendrick van der heul who sailed with william kidd  he had the fortune to have never been convicted of piracy and lived a full life beyond his days on the adventure prize other ranks include the boatswain  master  gunner  doctor  and the regular crewmen held the most power on the pirate ship in the council  from which all important decisions were made  and every pirate was given a vote  surgeons on some pirate vessels  because of their higher status in regular society and special training  were not allowed to vote when the council took to the ballot discipline aboard merchant and naval vessels was notoriously harsh  and  more often than not  violent  pirates  having suffered under these measures  used a more democratic process when determining how aberrant sailors would be punished  and there were fewer transgressions that were considered punishable  these punishments were still often violent  which was the norm in the early 18th  25,  154,  75a  part of becoming a pirate was to meet the expectation of uprooting their living environment and spending most of their time out at sea  the men were required to live in cramped  claustrophobic quarters within close proximity of others  the discomfort could have created a more hostile environment  but it did not  while on the ship the pirates  maintained a multicultural  multiracial  and multinational social order   this new social order established a profound sense of community amongst the men  they consistently showed solidarity for each other and developed strong feelings of group loyalty  the communities of pirates were willing to join forces  at sea and in port  even when the various crews were strangers to each 17,  94  the positive communal atmosphere aboard ship created a home-like  situation where there were limited social and physical boundaries within the standard issue uniforms for anyone on board a vessel were issued prior to 1748  in the british royal navy  clothing was somewhat standardized by 1623  when it was made possible for sailors to purchase clothing at fixed prices from the navy commissioners  the selection was not extensive  items included  monmouth capps  red caps  yarne stockings  irish stockings  blew shirts  white shirts  cotton waistcoats  cotton drawers  neats leather shoes  blew neck clothes  canvas suites  ruggs of one breadth  and blew suites  until 1664,  sailors that were pressed into the navy were not given any clothing  forced to use what clothes they had on their backs until accumulating several months of pay when they could then buy of the early eighteenth century and prior wore much the same clothing as any sailors  clothing  like any useful tangible good  when captured as booty  would be distributed out  calico jack rackham was known for his  flamboyant sir richard hawkins  the famous elizabethan privateer advocated wearing armor in battle while at sea  records indicate that there were not nearly enough pieces of armor for all to wear  so it likely was for his officers and woolen clothing was worn in more extreme in the stories of anne bonny and mary read  women  often when on a vessel would don men s clothing  this was immortalized in an english folk song   my yellow locks i will cut off  men s clothing will put on  and i will go along with you and be your academics like peter leeson and marcus rediker argue  a pirate was more often than not someone from a previous seagoing occupation  they were merchant seamen  sailors in the royal navy  and privateers  all of whom would form into a pirate they were not upper class  but the  dregs of george choundas argues in his book pirate primer that there was in fact a pirate language  but it was simply accents and the way of speech to which men of the seas were accustomed  they came from different ethnic backgrounds or political units  so pirate speech was simply the way these men could communicate  and what they all knew was the language of the it was the nautical speech of the seventeenth  eighteenth  and nineteenth centuries pirates of the atlantic ate much of the same foods as their mainstream mariner cohorts  often they would get more of it  but ideally  they would get far greater quality mariners in the merchant and naval service were often given meager amounts of low quality during a typical week five non-pirate  sailors might share four or five pounds (pre-salted  weight  of beef  and five pounds of scarcity of food might be the main reason some sailors turned to pirating  like pirate john phillips who  ranted and raved  about the merchant john wingfield  claiming that he starved his men  the primary difference between legal mariners and their unlawful counterparts is that they hoped to find an abundant supply of food with the capturing of vessels a defining difference in the food system on a pirate vessel is that they did not have to compete with officers like sailors in the navy or merchant and alcohol were treated similarly to each other  split equally  the necessaries of life were distributed equally  unlike booty  which was usually given in higher proportions to officers  as directed in their bread  butter  cheese  and meat were items that were considered luxuries by many low level mariners  but items that a pirate would look forward to as often as there is evidence pirates specifically hoped to find edibles in their loot over specie  one pirate  joseph mansfield  claimed that the  love of drink  were greater motives than this policy of strict equality does not seem to be applicable to earlier privateers  as kris lane points out in pillaging the empire  piracy in the americas  1500-1750.

lowthar s crew secretly inspected the cargo and found items of interest  once making their intentions known to the boarded crew  they ended up taking thirty casks of brandy and five hogshead of wine

fish such like snapper  shark  catfish  grouper  albacore were caught and often barbecued  though one would have to be certain not to let the deck on when food was scarce  a rationing system may be put in place similar to legal sailors  in some cases  the only items there were requested of the looted victim from pirates was food and when gold or silver was found  food was a popular item to barter for when bartering was easier than was essential  but difficult to keep usable for very alcohol  like beer and especially wines would keep much longer  like food  pirate crews were given equal

overindulgence had  long been regarded as one of the distinguishing characteristics of seafaring r  burg writes extensively about the debauchery and riotous behavior of pirates when they got a hold of quantities of alcohol  there are numerous cases where pirates were too drunk to capture ships  defend their own ships  negotiate for prisoner exchanges  control crews   preventing mutinies and sometimes even to just navigate  in one case ending up with 118  men of a 200-person  crew perishing because of a shipwreck  blackbeard  after a  prolonged drinking bout  and while  uproariously

better off than those who worked on merchant or naval ships as  food was superior    pay was higher    shifts were shorter   and the crew s powers of  decision making was greater   epidemics and scurvy led some to desert  naval vessels for pirates   in the event of disabilities occurring while in service to the ship  some pirates set up a  common wealth  plan to be paid to any man in the

a porringer which may have been used in bloodletting treatments  and a cast brass mortar and used in preparing were doctors and surgeons present on some pirate vessels  any surgeon or doctor who sailed with pirates  according to rediker  was considered by their peers  to be surgeons doctors were paid more shares  between  one and a quarter  and  one and a half   than other men on pirate however  doctors and surgeons weren t always trusted as they were not allowed to vote with the crew  because their class background  or forced surrounding women on ships were 29  being on board a pirate ship demanded  physical strength and stamina   few women were able to do the work to the standard  it was widely believed aboard ships that women were detrimental to both work and social order  women were  objects of fantasy   yet they were also seen as cause of poor circumstances  disagreement  and  potential breaches in the male order of seagoing rare occurrence in which a woman was persuaded to board a pirate ship comes from the story of captain eric cobham and a prostitute named maria  even though the ship s articles stated boys and women were not permitted on the ship  cobham faced no repercussions from the crew when he brought her aboard  while on the ship  maria proved that she was  as callous as the worst of them   maria s actions made cobham  more nervous than ever   so much so that she effectively scared him from :110,  111anne  bonny  after meeting  calico jack  rackham  came aboard his ship and gave him the necessary votes he needed to be elected captain  anne

fantasy  which allowed her to escape unharmed from possible battles through duplicity and  a good measure of read was less rash and spontaneous than her counterpart  bonny  read was also admired for  her virtue and sense of justice   both read and bonny dressed as women aboard the ship but would change into trousers for battle  these women were accepted by the crew due to their management ability  navigational skills  and by their continued perseverance to outperform the rest of the 192,  206–207  bonny and read were independently established as fierce  swashbuckling women  and were defined as genuine pirates in every sense  nonetheless  women as pirates were virtually needed the pirates  world  like other seafarers   was homosocial  historian b  r  burg interprets this male-only  world as being a choice these men made to live where there were many opportunities for sodomitical conduct  burg argues that sodomitical behavior was not proscribed in the late 17th  and early 18th  centuries  and this allowed seamen to have the choice to live in sodomitical communities  while pirates  as described by defoe johnson  did occasionally take wives and rape female captives  burg argues that this was unusual and not indicative of a heterosexual 1–41,  112–121hans  turley  using literary evidence  suggests that the deviant nature of piracy went hand-in-hand  with their perceived both turley and burg note that this homosexual behavior in no way implied that these men were effeminate  on the contrary  their contemporaries considered them eastman also finds that pirates were represented as hypermasculine characters from the 18th  century forward  and she also notes that they were depicted as sexual transgressors  she argues that this imagery of piracy appealed to elite men  who enjoyed the thought of an alternate masculinity without the restraint required of men in the upper scourge of the high seas pirates were cast as  hostis humani generis   a term which was derived from roman this title was rendered onto them in part by sir edward coke in his effort to renovate existing legislation which dealt with as a consequence of this label  an admiralty judge by the name of sir charles hedge would issue a sweeping proclamation which would grant the power of  jurisdiction over all people – anywhere on earth – who interfered with english the last great epoch of piracy gave rise to individuals who as a cohort were defined by   their almost universal rejection of national and religious the book rum  sodomy  and the lash  hans turley delves into the implications of the multidimensional threat pirates posed to the social and economic establishment within british realm  turley states that there was an argument to be made in which pirates were perceived to  belong to no class at all  and that they had  turned their backs to normative society   furthermore  to solidify the rendering of the term hostis humani generis to pirates  turley connects the economic and legal implications stating that pirates were  criminal merchants  who were  opposed to law-abiding  seafaring mather  a puritan minister wrote that the coast had been plagued by pirates and his congregation wished they could be rid of this nuisance  mather believed that his prayers were answered when six pirates were captured and taken prisoner  before their execution took place  he both  bestowed the best instructions  he could and prayed with 729,  488  after preaching to the pirates mather  wanted them to  provide examples and warnings  to the crowd awaiting the executions to  affirm the values of christianity  ministers advocated that children should be  protected  from this rebellious lifestyle and should be  kept from going to sea   many ministers felt that pursuing religion while at sea would be  impossible to sustain as long as sailors took the name of the lord in minister john flavel also made the point that the sea was a place  with strange creatures  where sins proliferated and  death was omnipresent   flavel continued that seamen were  to be numbered neither with the living nor the dead  their lives hanging continually in suspense before at sea was tough  which could cause men to feel their  own insignificance and dependence upon the almighty there were even societies and organizations that promoted religion to sailors along the waterfronts  such as  the marine bible society of new york  the seamen in the port of new york  spgas   and the american seamen s friend society were viewed as godless individuals  and yet  the closest thing to  a  pirate constitution  was new england  puritan church ‘covenants    just without the acceptance of the "god-fearing  people  claimed that pirates were  devils   bound for hell   some pirates  such as blackbeard  embraced this belief by inverting  the values of christianity   casting themselves in a way that  society understood to be evil   and even to the embrace of legal system of the english during the late seventeenth century was built upon common law (28  henry viii  c  15).  this allowed circumstantial evidence to be admissible  but also forced the captured to be transferred to england where the law was enforceable  this made it burdensome for the colonial governments to enforce extradition during the seventeenth century  after jamaica had become a haven for pirates  henry morgan was selected as deputy governor  during this period  there was debate among english scholars about the extent of jurisdiction of the 1536  acts  jamaica had one of the first laws to deliver justice with royal legitimacy  it became known as  the jamaica act   1683  would mark the beginning of aggressive anti-piracy  the increasingly anti-piratical  policy by the jamaican government started an exodus from jamaica  this law was the only one of its kind in the caribbean or north american colonies and it simply forced the buccaneers and pirates out  into the carolinas  new york  and the nutting makes the argument that it was the early golden age pirates raping and pillaging of several muslim pilgrims in 1695  that was initially responsible for the flood of legislation in the early eighteenth century  following henry avery s capture of the mogul ship quote  the east india company petitioned the privy council in 1696  to issue a proclamation of arrest  a reward of fifty pounds was offered for avery s crew  while five-hundred  pounds was offered for avery himself  those incidences lead to the piracy act of 1700.  the legislation took two years to pass after repeated pressures from the east india company and the board of trade  there was now authorization to set up vice-admiralty  courts throughout the colonies with legal authority to carry out sentencing  the first notable pirate to be brought to trial with this new set of laws was captain kidd  kidd was denied an adequate defense  as well as the ability to review documents he claimed would exonerate him  ironically  he was acquitted of piracy  but convicted of murder  regardless  he was executed and his body was hung in chains over the river thames for the end of the war of spanish succession (1702–1713)  and the peace of ultrecht legal privateers working for a legitimately recognized government simple turned to piracy  as many politicians feared  the privateering strategy of war corruption of local officials was also a problem for authorities  edward teach  blackbeard  bribed the colonial governor of north carolina to avoid increased effort to combat piracy with naval forces  effectively stamped out piracy  this combination of laws and naval efforts was responsible for thousands of deaths of pirates and alleged pirates  in a time when royal mercy and pardons in england routinely commuted death penalties to lesser sentences  especially one or another form of bound labor  after the transportation act of 1718),  pirates rarely had their sentences lessened and instead were hanged in huge numbers and high was not until the signing of the treaty of utrecht was signed in 1713  settling the war with france that britain could make a serious attempt to deploy its navy against piracy  by 1718  the royal naval was refit for action against the pirates and with third  fourth  and fifth rate war ships armed with some seventy plus guns  it was more firepower than any pirate ship of the time could have withstood  as david cordingly argues  the pirates were  no match for naval squadrons of this strength   and that the only reason piracy had been so successful was because the british government had not put this level of effort into hunting pirates well known naval actions against pirates are the successful destructions of edward teach  or blackbeard  and bartholomew roberts  in seventeen eighteen  off the coast of north carolina at the ocracoke inlet  teach s ship was at anchor and surprised by lieutenant maynard of the royal navy  maynard and teach engaged each other with small arms and cannon until the ships were close enough to board  maynard boarded the pirate ship to fight teach  and the notorious pirate eventually fell  blackbeard s death became the stuff of legend and was used by the royal navy in its propaganda campaign in eliminating 200–201in  1721  the infamous pirate captain roberts was cornered off the coast of africa by a captain ogle in the hms swallow  a powerful fifty gun warship  roberts was converting a group of french ships that he had captured for his own use when the swallow sailed up to engage  roberts would fight ogle despite being outmanned and outgunned  he fell during the 214–215  with arguably the most famous pirates of the time gone  and the american coast and caribbean swarming with the royal navy and privateers hired by governors of the american colonies  piracy was systematically hunted to near 220in  the atlantic world of the 17th  and 18th  centuries piracy was defined as any criminal act committed on the high seas  this means that many of those accused of piracy were criminals but not necessarily a crew of sailors capturing ships  william wood who was convicted and hanged for taking his captains money after he and another sailor got in an argument with him and threw him published the statute relating to piracy in the early 18th  century in a general history of the pyrates  the crime was differentiated from wartime privateering in the statute  and defined who was punishable in very specific terms  the prescribed punishment  if convicted  was  death without benefit of clergy  and forfeit land and goods   the statute was applicable to the american colonies  but scotland was excluded  a death sentence could be carried out on captured pirates at sea without benefit of trial  according to the statute  often clergy were called in to advise the prisoner in the time before his death  or someone else fulfilled this 350,  285throughout  his text  defoe johnson describes the punishments meted out on captured pirates  public execution by hanging was typical  although some were given lesser sentences such as indentures if the court was unconvinced of their complicity with the pirate mission  or if there were other extenuating circumstances  bodies were also sometimes displayed after the 369  executions in the early 18th  century were somewhat common throughout the atlantic world  and there were hundreds of crimes that could lead to admiralty courts and men like cotton mather would eventually wrest power from the rogue elements  with gruesome public acts taking place for all to see  pirates would be killed and displayed en masse at many of the ports they once looted or called home in the new term  ghost ship  is a long-standing  seafaring term for  any vessel found sailing without her crew   supernatural powers are bound to surface in any discussion of ghost ships  one well-known  ghost ship is the flying dutchman that is said to be continuously exploring for  safe harbor  and is condemned to eternally  haunt the was not unusual for a crew to abandon their ship in times of  sinking   by use of lifeboats or acquiring another vessel  occasionally whole crews might have been  swept overboard  in rough weather  but the vessel would be destroyed enough to explain the crew s fate  even less frequently  ships could be overtaken by pirates or from a mutiny within the crew  during this time  the crew would be  abducted and forced  to man other vessels in 1735,  the ship baltimore was found anchored in chebogue  nova scotia  the people of the town speculated about the  supernatural powers  that guided the vacant ship  after an investigation aboard the ship occurred  the men noticed the deck  was awash with blood   once inside  the men found a woman who described how  local indians  murdered the crew  after this  the ship was abandoned as not a single person  wanted to buy it  sail it  or even go aboard   some time passed before the locals learned the crew was actually murdered by the prisoners being carried in the vessel  and the woman was one of ten inmates who had an unknown ghost ship was seen in 1785;  the vessel had  no sails  and  no crew  with  fifteen africans on board   based upon their desolate condition  it was deemed their time on board the ship had been lengthy  a  shipboard rebellion  might have occurred in which the crew had perished along with some africans  in this scenario  it is possible that none of the survivors understood  how to sail the vessel and they slowly starved to in the twentieth century  the ship carroll a  deering was found in the atlantic with no crew aboard  the lifeboats were missing and the theories surrounding the ship included  piracy  mutiny  and insurance most notorious of all ghost ships is the mary celeste – it has been called  the greatest maritime mystery of all time   the ship was found wet after a storm by the crew of dei gratia  because the ship was opened to air out  one theory surrounding the vessel is that the crew needed to air out the ship from chemical fumes from the alcohol  the crew had left everything because they  expected to come back  to the vessel after the fumes had cleared  they got off the ship temporally and waited for the ship to air out in their  small yawl   but the weather changed before they were able to get back to the vessel  the crew of eight men  a mother and child  watched  helplessly  as the ghost ship sailed away without her 242–247on  every voyage a sailor would face the risk of falling overboard and drowning  starvation  disease  abuse  accidents in the rigging  and once a sailor abandoned his law-abiding  career to become a pirate he knowingly increased his chance of expediting his own death exponentially  once convicted as a pirate  a sailor faced an almost certain demise of being hanged at the execution on trial in charleston  the pirate job bayley was asked why he had attacked several warships that were sent to capture him  he answered that  we thought it had been a pirate   at yet another trial in london the pirate john bayley comically played dumb when the judge asked what he would have done if the warship that apprehended him was nothing more than a merchant ship answering   i don t know what i would have done   both men knew that their fate was sealed the moment they were apprehended and both in turn hanged at the 161the  story of pirate william fly  who was executed on july 12,  1726  in boston  illustrates how arrogantly many pirates viewed death  he showed no anxiety over his imminent demise  but rather tied his own noose and lectured the hangman about the proper way to tie the knot  right before he swung off to his death he delivered a warning to all ships captains and owners that in order to prevent their crews from mutinying and resorting to piracy  they would be wise to pay their crews on time and treat them humanly some pirates preferred to control their own fate  pairs of pirates would at times make oaths to one another that in order to insure that neither were captured they would shoot each other  the crew of bartholomew roberts preferred not to be taken alive and swore to blow themselves up rather than give the authorities the satisfaction of seeing them hanged  when roberts and his men were finally found an attempt was made to blow the ship up rather than face capture  however it proved in vain due to an insufficient gunpowder  edward teach s  blackbeard s  crew also failed to detonate their sloop when facing capture however  the pirate joseph cooper and his crew successfully blew themselves up and evaded capture by the the 17th  and 18th  centuries execution in the british realm was commonplace and a part of life  during the 17th  century alone around 800  people were hanged each year in the british empire  for a pirate however the odds of finding yourself on the gallows were much higher  in just the ten-year  span between 1716  and 1726  at least 418  pirates  and possibly as much as half again more  were hanged  in this world a pirate could be nearly certain that if caught he would end up with a short drop and sudden stop with a noose cinched around his gallows were an icon of the 17th  and 18th  century and could be readily found throughout the atlantic world  the gallows were particular visible in port cities that routinely featured an execution dock such as  hope point  the famous execution dock on the river thames in wapping  for many pirates this would be the place that their career was put to an end  for some  however  their body would serve one more function  as a reminder  hundreds of pirates were hanged and their bodies left to dangle in port cities around the world as a reminder that the maritime state would not tolerate a challenge from examples of this barbarous practice can be seen throughout pirate history  including those of william fly  whose body was hung in chains at the entrance of boston harbor to and calico jack  whose body was hung at the mouth of the harbor of port royal  than civil courts  pirate trials were overseen by the court of admiralty  the court of admiralty  held mass trials  with  large numbers of pirates at one time  as demonstrations to those interested in taking on a pirate s life  the trial transcripts were frequently published and confessions by those who were to be executed were  very popular   the publication of the trials was intended  to inform  enlighten  and entertain the reading public  as well as  make a profit for the book sellers   reprints of trials were a common occurrence in order to gain political strength  though the trials took place in english  they were transcribed in latin as a way to further remove the public from the transcription s truth and to use it as propaganda  much of these pamphlets felt repetitive in nature as many of the statements and arguments were the same  just with different trials were also a place of humor  as job bayley  who was facing execution for being a pirate  stated that he had not stopped for the government vessels because he had feared the ships were the trials took place in england  due to the fact that the  admiralty feared that officials in the far-flung  outposts of the empire could be bribed   however  an issue with holding trials in england was that the pirates would have to be transported  across vast distances   the law regarding piracy trials was changed at the beginning of the eighteenth century  granting more relaxed rules and allowing for trials to take place in english colonies  so long as a court of admiralty was available  pirates faced greater danger of being executed when the law changed  as it stated if a pirate was taken at sea  an official trial was not necessary  but the end result of execution was to be the an act in 1700  allowed for the expansion of the definition of piracy to include not just those  who committed robbery by sea   but also the  mutineer who ran away with the ship  as well as the  sailor who interfered with the defense of his vessel  under a pirate siege  in both 1717  and 1718,  pardons were granted in order to  rid the sea of robbers   for example  israel hands  blackbeard s henchman  was taken with fifteen other pirates to williamsburg  virginia to stand in exchange for a pardon  hands testified against corrupt north carolina officials with whom teach had consorted  the minutes of the north carolina governor’s council for may 27,  1719  state  hesikia master of capt thaches sloop

the same deposition acknowledgth that to be out of the reach of his he being all the time at the sd inlet which lyes at above thirty leagues distance from house and further the tobias knight doth pray your honours to observe that the aforsd hesikias hands was       for some time before the giving of the evidence kept in prison under the terrors of death a most severe prosecution       many stipulations came with these pardons  as they were only granted in certain instances and few surrendered  the few who  accepted the amnesty  would eventually return to their pirate ways  death was also promised to those found helping pirates  as well as  loss of wages  and  six months  imprisonment to those who refused to defend their ship   instead of having black pirates stand trial  colonial officials would profit  by selling them into slavery rather than hanging 53trials  for women pirates were not uniform in sentencing and punishment  mary harvey  whose alias was martha farlee  was sentenced in north carolina in the year 1726.  both mary and her husband thomas had joined a pirate gang  and shortly thereafter mary was captured  since north carolina lacked the infrastructure to try pirates  mary and three others were sent to williamsburg  mary  was acquitted and given money to return home  as the court deemed she had been coerced into joining the pirate gang  two of the other captives were not as lucky  and were  condemned to die   the third captive was three years later  another female pirate  mary crickett  along with five others  was ordered to be when mary read and anne bonny were captured  they faced execution  however  once their pregnancies were known  they were pardoned from the gallows  both women were sentenced to prison  where mary read eventually perished and anne bonny later 210in  1724,  the first edition of a general history of robberies and murders of the most notorious pirates was published  the author was listed as a captain charles johnson  there were three more editions published within two years of the first  all with the same captain johnson listed as author  questions surrounding the authorship of this seminal work have plagued a general history for decades  if not centuries  at the center of the question is the identity of captain johnson  the man who was originally named the author of this book has not been found to exist  there has been no record found of anyone with the name charles johnson serving as a captain in any capacity  save forty–two years before the publication of a general history  there was a playwright by that name in the early eighteenth century  but there are no ties to piracy found in his works  some have suggested that the  captain  was in fact a common pirate  but again  there is no record of this 1932,  a literary scholar and writer named john robert moore posited that daniel defoe be acknowledged the author of a general history  after years of research in connection with a collection of defoe s works  moore published a study of his findings  detailing his argument for defoe s authorship of this  and other  works  moore declared that a general history was  substantially  a work of defoe based on writing style and content similar to other pieces that have been attributed to defoe  moore argued that defoe s interest in subjects such as  seafaring  and criminals shows that a general history falls squarely into his repertoire  moore posited that not only could other works be used to confirm that defoe wrote a general history  but that a general history could be used to endorse his authorship of those same works  another point that moore counted on to validate his claims was that many authors  to include historians  had used a general history of the pyrates as a source of information for their own between different defoe biographers called his body of work into question  based on the accounts of these many biographers  defoe s attributed canon went from 101  different works to 570  between the years of 1790  and 1970.  most of these additions were made on the basis of internal   stylistic  evidence  moore s publication of his checklist of the writings of daniel defoe added almost 200  works alone  many questioned not only his attribution of a general history to defoe  but the general trend of biographers to continually add to the canon  one critic even suggested  based on this trend  that all anonymous works from the early eighteenth century be designated defoe s  philip furbank and w  r  owens  arguments against defoe s authorship of a general history address the parallels that are drawn to other works of the time  often also attributed to defoe  and the logical fallacies that are necessary to subscribe to such a large  diverse catalog  many of the ideas and phrases that moore points to as parallels  and therefore as proof of defoe s continuity in his works  were commonplace in the eighteenth century  according to furbank and owens  moore s attribution of a general history to defoe was based on no external evidence and only those few circumstantial 102–108modern  historians have very different ideas regarding the authorship of a general history and what this attribution means for historiography  as many historians point out  a general history of the pyrates set the tone for every work on pirates that has been written since  since the attribution  there have been three schools of thought concerning the subject  those who agree with moore s conclusions  those who do not  and even some who do not think that it matters  prior to furbank and owens  work on defoe s canon  some scholars accepted that defoe authored a general history  while others postulated that authorship does not matter  interestingly  however  some people  still believed that defoe was the some scholars compared the work to other records and sources from the time and concluded that a general history is highly significant for its amount of accuracy  regardless of attribution  what is most important about this work is not who penned it  but that it represents what people thought about pirates in the early eighteenth with any historical subject  opinions are seen to change with time and evidence  some scholars once believed that defoe was undoubtedly the author of a general history  but more recently have sided with those who attribute the work to johnson  or at least someone else using this 179–80n24  most scholars now agree that it is most likely that defoe is not the author of a general history  one academic calls for the abandonment of the  attractive theory  that gives this credit to whoever the true author of a general history of the pyrates  his was a major work destined to influence writers and scholars for centuries to come pirates were not members of society  they were outside the social norms that would allow buccaneers and privateers to remain within the infrastructure of a the key reason they cannot be grouped with any social order is because they embraced terror  and particularly as marcus rediker phrased it   a terror of the strong against the the historian hans turley used the phrase  hostis humani generis   translated as the enemy of all mankind  to provide an image of pirates have thus become the  antiheroes  of history  and this they did so consciously  eventually the governments of the known world would make villains of these sea raiders calling them  blood lusting monsters   whose sole purpose was  destroying the social pirate would attack every element of the modern society to form his own identity  they would attack merchant shipping from any nation  plundering the wealth of the ship  and most of the time sinking or burning a great number who fell into their hands  pirates did not take prisoners  and would kill all who resisted capture with their jolly rodger signifying surrender or die mentality  revenge was sought against merchant captains and officers who were known to have been cruel or unreasonable in the treatment of their crew  often through torture and slow death  not to limit themselves on the amount of wealth available to them  pirates would attack slave ships and slave fortresses on the african coast to take slaves  for whom they knew some governments would pay for in gold coin  most notably the 14,  83,  139hans  turley looks to the literary evidence of pirates  and in particular captain avery  when drawing the conclusion of the pirate as the  antihero   avery s story became the stuff of legend to the masses  and the  fictional exaggeration  of avery cemented in the minds of the readers the image of a brute bent on theft  ransom  and power  turley assures us that the stories were lifted beyond the realm of reality but it is impossible to know for sure who the real captain avery was  and it was legitimate to believe the stories due to the lack of any evidence to the 62–63,  72an  attack on commerce and shipping meant an attack on the governments to who these ships belonged  it is worth noting however that governments would stop turning a blind eye to these bandits when the costs of ignoring them outweighed attacking the pirate  and so a  campaign to cleanse the seas   was put into effect by governments  lawyers  businessmen  writers  and other members of legitimate 127marcus  rediker argues that religion was another point of contention for the pirate  who saw the church as a piece of the system he wanted to escape  the pirate was seen as existing in sin by those who lived in normal social constructs  and he relished the separation  likening himself to hellish images and satan  as an example blackbeard and his use of smoke  fire  and ash bellowing from his large bead to give the impression of a demon from hell itself  as johnson defoe describes him  pirates would mock and ridicule men of the cloth who they came in contact with  and did not observe christian their attacks on private property  belief systems  and governments pirates became outcasts to the realm of the unknown and dangerous  this realm  the sea as rediker suggests  aided in the view of the pirate as a danger  a threat of invasion  and uncontrollable entity  just as the sea was to those who both knew the sea and had only heard tales  it was the sea that was separated from authority  and thus was the pirate who could attack those who entered the 134,  135scholars  consider many sources of information during their research  primary sources are documents and records that are original to the time that is being studied  secondary sources are written later  and can include commentary on and interpretation of primary sources  firsthand information about piracy is relatively rare  and scholars often pull from the same texts when compiling their data  during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries  narratives of sea captains and pirate adventures took many forms the dime novel is sensationalist fiction originating in the 1860s.  irwin p  beadle   company standardized the books into a format that contemporary readers could easily identify at newsstands and in book catalogs  they had a yellowish orange cover that often feature a woodcut illustration  dime novels were very popular with a wide readership  during the civil war beadle   company shipped the books by the crate to the army and by mid-1965  they had published between 35,000–80,000  72,  74  there are several comprehensive indices of published titles  but the most prominent is the work of albert this is a two volume work with detailed information and the publishers beadle and adams  lists of titles and authorial biographies  popular themes for dime novels included stories of the wild west  the american revolution

for the city s may day celebration and the legend of jose gaspar fit the over the years rumors have circulated that jose gaspar was not indeed an actual person  but that means little to the tampa community  tampa historian karl grismer counters criticisms of the factuality of jose gaspar  aka gasparilla  with the statement that the doubters have  no romance in their marcel d ans argues that perhaps gasparilla s most successful invasion is the one he has made into the memory of tampans  becoming in their mind  the main cultural identity factor  while the historical truth of gasparilla lies in the existence of the legend and its fact or fiction  tampans have celebrated the invasion of jose gaspar with enthusiasm for over a century  gasparilla had a bit of a rocky start and was  at first  attached to other community events  the inaugural invasion in 1904  was part of the city s may day celebration and in 1905  and 1906  was tied to the florida state interest in the festival fizzled a bit between 1906  and 1910,  but the completion of the panama canal gave tampans a good reason for reviving the pirate festival  rosanna ensley argues that the 1910  gasparilla festival was a celebration of american imperialism and community growth  but that the festival always  featured piracy as its organizational for the 1916  celebration ye mystic krewe of gasparilla managed to borrow a  pirate ship  and thus began the tradition of invading tampa through the harbor rather than on the festival is a reflection of civic and national events that have shaped the tampa bay area and therefore was put on hiatus during both world however  in 1947  the city resumes the festival and for the first time  the concept goes national with the gasparilla queen dolly sutton robson participating in the memphis cotton by 1974  the pirate identity and jose gaspar were so ingrained into tampa s civic identity that the only logical name for the new nfl franchise was the celebratory air surrounding gasparilla  the event has not been without controversy  in 1991  ye mystic krewe of gasparilla came into the spotlight amid accusations of elitism and the all white krewe was part of the inaugural celebration and over the years has become one of the most elite  secretive associations in the tampa bay tampa mayor sandy freedman demanded that the krewe initiate at least 25  black members or the city would withdraw support for the 1991  parade  which was set to coincide with super bowl xxv  the krewe refused to meet the city s demand and withdrew their support for the event  in a last minute effort the city pulled off an alternative parade the following year ye mystic krewe of gasparilla had accepted four black members and resumed their traditional sponsorship of the parade  in the wake of the controversy surrounding ye mystic krewe of gasparilla many new krewes were created that reflected the diversity of the tampa bay in london in 1715,  the whydah gally was a 300-ton  galley originally commissioned for use in the slave trade  the whydah left on her maiden voyage to the coast of africa in after selling a cargo of slaves to in jamaica  the whydah was heading home to london with a new cargo of gold and silver when she was captured by black sam bellamy in 1717.  in the spring of 1717,  sam bellamy and his crew sailed north with the intent to clean the ship  divide the spoils and determine the future of the crew  the whydah was caught in a storm and capsized off the coast of cape 9–10  the whydah was rediscovered in 1984  by barry clifford  a salvage diver and cape cod surrounded the whydah long before clifford brought up the first artifacts  in 1982  the state of massachusetts filed a claim of ownership on the whydah after a long battle through a succession of courts  sole ownership of the whydah was granted to clifford in this was only the beginning of the troubles for the whydah artifacts  new troubles arose when silver screen entertainment directors  tom bernstein and roland betts proposed the concept for developing a large-scale  museum complex devoted to the whydah  the museum was offered to the city of boston  where controversy surrounding the whydah s history as a slave ship had already made waves with local government officials  the proposal for the museum included plans for a full-scale  replica of the ship  a holographic image of sam bellamy  a conservation viewing area  interpretation of artifacts  a play acting out pirate hangings  and an exploration of the whydah s history as a slave ship  concern was raised that a  theme park  was being built around the concept of a slave ship  state representative byron rushing compared this concept to building a  theme park based on a concentration camp   ultimately developers bernstein and betts decided that the political atmosphere of boston was to unsteady on the issue  having ended negotiations with boston  bernstein and betts looked to tampa as a possible location for the 214–216the  tampa debate unwound in a similar manner to the one in boston  opposition to the whydah complex was spearheaded by tampa lawyer warren dawson  who voiced concerns that slavery was trivialized through an association with a panel of historians was convened to discuss the issue of interpreting the whydah s slave history  after careful review of the project the panel decided that the whydah complex could effectively interpret slavery  but the decision created more controversy from the public  after months of negotiations and compromises the tampa community was still divided over the potential implications of a whydah museum  in mid-july  1993,  the developers officially announced that they were pulling the project from tampa community s feelings about the whydah have mellowed little  in 2006  the controversy flared again when the museum of science and industry  mosi  attempted to host the traveling exhibit of the whydah artifacts sponsored by national geographic  after several conferences with area leaders  mosi decided not to host the philip levy argues that the whydah exhibit would have provided opportunity to explore connections between atlantic pirates and slavery  the actions of atlantic pirates  who often attacked slave ships and forts  created a crisis in the european slave trade  these actions were so detrimental that britain viewed pirates as a  fearsome enemy  and a  great the subject of piracy  writings in the nineteenth century mostly consisted of the reprinting of source materials with little  if any commentary or interpretation  reprinting ensured that historians remained objective  and that the grand pirate narratives remained intact  the big names of buccaneers and pirates like captain morgan and blackbeard were major players in those stories  in the first part of the twentieth century  scholars who did not present faithful reprints published books on piracy that were little more than rewriting the same well-known  stories the evolution of the history of piracy mirrors that of many other subjects  as historians began to stray from the strict retelling of these stories  piracy became more significant  in the latter part of the twentieth century  historians began to see the atlantic world in early modern times as an important frame in telling stories of colonialism  capitalism  slavery  and modernity in recent historiographical works  pirates have been viewed through various lenses  modern scholars have posited many reasons for the rise in piracy in the early eighteenth century  from a growing social emphasis on economics and to rebellion against an oppressive upper recent academic books on piracy in the atlantic world focus on the pirates and their relationships with the wider world
