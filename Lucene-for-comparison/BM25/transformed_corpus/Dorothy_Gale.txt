speak in childlike contractions with ozma of oz  which she continues to do throughout the series   this aspect of her character was somewhat lessened by her companionship of ozma  in whom baum placed the greater level of wisdom and dignity  yet even this is complicated by her associations with her cousin  zeb of hugson s ranch  a rugged  manly boy who does not take well to oz and cannot think of anything much more interesting than defeating the munchkins  wrestling champion  which he proves unable to do dorothy has several other pets  including her white pink purple kitten  eureka  popular in

essentially marrying the is a standard character  having at least a cameo role in thirteen of the fourteen oz books written by l  frank baum  while she did not appear at all in the marvelous land of oz  she is mentioned several times in that story  as it was her actions in the wonderful wizard of oz that led to the events in the former  and is at least a frequent figure in the nineteen that followed by author ruth plumly thompson  getting at least a cameo in all her books except captain salt in oz  in which neither oz nor any of its inhabitants appear  though they are mentioned   major subsequent appearances by dorothy in the  famous forty  are in the lost princess of oz  glinda of oz  the royal book of oz  grampa in oz  the lost king of oz  the wishing horse of oz  ozoplaning with the wizard of oz  and the magical mimics in oz  most of the other books focus on different child protagonists  some ozite  some from other nonestican realms  and some from the united states  and as such  her appearances in the main series become more and more limited  in jack snow s the magical mimics in oz (1946),  ozma places dorothy on the throne of oz while she is away visiting queen lurline

was an evil witch like her old enemy  the wicked witch of the west   in the wishing horse of oz  she makes unsavory comments about the dark coloration gloma and her subjects take on as a disguise  making them somewhat resemble black people  this behavior is not characteristic of dorothy in baum s oz books  in the patchwork girl of oz  she pushes and slaps through crowds of black tottenhots to rescue the scarecrow  whom they are tossing around  but this is more an example of her gumption than any sort of prejudice  as she is otherwise kind and polite to the tottenhots  and accepts that their ways are different from those who dwell in the emerald city the authorized sequels of sherwood smith  the emerald wand of oz and trouble under oz  center on the child characters dori and em  who live with their aunt susan  all three are indirect descendants of dorothy  though their specific relationship to her is unclear philip josé farmer s 1982  science-fiction  novel a barnstormer in oz tells the story of aviator henry  hank  stover — who is not surprised one beautiful spring day in 1923  when he flies his curtiss jenny biplane through a strange green cloud and finds himself in oz  hank knows that he is in oz because his mother  dorothy gale-stover,  had been there back in 1890  and later told him of her experiences  farmer s premise is that dorothy only visited oz once and told her story to a journalist called frank baum  this journalist would later create a series of books from dorothy s only adventure in oz  farmer s oz is on the brink of both a civil war and an invasion by the united states army dorothy s last name is never mentioned in the wonderful wizard of oz or the marvelous land of oz  the first two oz books  it is disclosed in the third book ozma of oz (1907).  the last name of gale was originally mentioned in baum s script for the 1902  broadway stage version of the wizard of oz  in which it was originally a setup for a punning joke   dorothy   i am dorothy  and i am one of the kansas gales   scarecrow   that accounts for your breezy manner   an influence on the creation of dorothy appears to be the alice books of lewis carroll  although baum reportedly found these plots incoherent  he identified their source of popularity as alice herself  a character with whom child readers could identify  this influenced his choice of a protagonist for his own character was probably named after baum s own niece  dorothy louise gage  who died in infancy  baum s wife was very attached to her and was deeply grieved by her death  so there is speculation that baum inserted her name into his stories as a memorial  elements of dorothy gale s character are possibly derived from matilda joslyn gage  dorothy gage s grandmother  dorothy gage is buried in evergreen cemetery in bloomington  sandlin writes that l  frank baum read a disaster report of a tornado in irving  kansas  in may 1879  which included the name of a victim  dorothy gale  who was  found buried face down in a mud baum s 1902  stage musical adaptation  dorothy was played by anna laughlin  in 1908  l  frank baum adapted his early oz novels as the fairylogue and radio-plays,  with romola remus as dorothy  this was followed by the wonderful wizard of oz  a motion picture short that otis turner  one of the directors of fairylogue  made without baum as part of a contract

but whether daniels participated is unknown  baum subsequently loosely adapted the wonderful wizard of oz into a 1914  motion picture directed by j  farrell macdonald titled his majesty  the scarecrow of oz with violet macmillan as dorothy dorothy does not appear in the patchwork girl of oz (1914),  although some film books claim that mildred harris  who had yet to sign her contract with the oz film manufacturing company  played the role  the character  is  in fact  eliminated from the film version  although she has a fairly large role in the novel dorothy dwan portrayed dorothy in the 1925  film wizard of oz  in this film  aunt em  mary carr  informs her on her eighteenth birthday that she was left on their doorstep and is really a princess of oz destined to marry prince kynd  bryant
