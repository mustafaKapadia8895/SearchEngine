 planetary science -  wikipediaplanetary science or  more rarely  planetology  is the scientific study of planets  including earth   moons  and planetary systems  in particular those of the solar system  and the processes that form them  it studies objects ranging in size from micrometeoroids to gas giants  aiming to determine their composition  dynamics  formation  interrelations and history  it is a strongly interdisciplinary field  originally growing from astronomy and earth but which now incorporates many disciplines  including planetary geology  together with geochemistry and geophysics   cosmochemistry  atmospheric science  oceanography  hydrology  theoretical planetary science  glaciology  and allied disciplines include space physics  when concerned with the effects of the sun on the bodies of the solar system  and astrobiology there are interrelated observational and theoretical branches of planetary science  observational research can involve a combination of space exploration  predominantly with robotic spacecraft missions using remote sensing  and comparative  experimental work in earth-based  laboratories  the theoretical component involves considerable computer simulation and mathematical modelling planetary scientists are generally located in the astronomy and physics or earth sciences departments of universities or research centres  though there are several purely planetary science institutes worldwide  there are several major conferences each year  and a wide range of peer-reviewed  journals  in the case of some exclusive planetary scientists  many of whom are in relation to the study of dark matter  they will seek a private research centre and often initiate partnership research tasks the history of planetary science may be said to have begun with the ancient greek philosopher democritus  who is reported by hippolytus as sayingthe ordered worlds are boundless and differ in size  and that in some there is neither sun nor moon  but that in others  both are greater than with us  and yet with others more in number  and that the intervals between the ordered worlds are unequal  here more and there less  and that some increase  others flourish and others decay  and here they come into being and there they are eclipsed  but that they are destroyed by colliding with one another  and that some ordered worlds are bare of animals and plants and all more modern times  planetary science began in astronomy  from studies of the unresolved planets  in this sense  the original planetary astronomer would be galileo  who discovered the four largest moons of jupiter  the mountains on the moon  and first observed the rings of saturn  all objects of intense later study  galileo s study of the lunar mountains in 1609  also began the study of extraterrestrial landscapes  his observation  that the moon certainly does not possess a smooth and polished surface  suggested that it and other worlds might appear  just like the face of the earth in telescope construction and instrumental resolution gradually allowed increased identification of the atmospheric and surface details of the planets  the moon was initially the most heavily studied  as it always exhibited details on its surface  due to its proximity to the earth  and the technological improvements gradually produced more detailed lunar geological knowledge  in this scientific process  the main instruments were astronomical optical telescopes  and later radio telescopes  and finally robotic exploratory spacecraft the solar system has now been relatively well-studied,  and a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system exists  however  there are large numbers of unsolved and the rate of new discoveries is very high  partly due to the large number of interplanetary spacecraft currently exploring the solar system this is both an observational and a theoretical science  observational researchers are predominantly concerned with the study of the small bodies of the solar system  those that are observed by telescopes  both optical and radio  so that characteristics of these bodies such as shape  spin  surface materials and weathering are determined  and the history of their formation and evolution can be understood theoretical planetary astronomy is concerned with dynamics  the application of the principles of celestial mechanics to the solar system and extrasolar planetary systems the best known research topics of planetary geology deal with the planetary bodies in the near vicinity of the earth  the moon  and the two neighbouring planets  venus and mars  of these  the moon was studied first  using methods developed earlier on the earth geomorphology studies the features on planetary surfaces and reconstructs the history of their formation  inferring the physical processes that acted on the surface  planetary geomorphology includes the study of several classes of surface features the history of a planetary surface can be deciphered by mapping features from top to bottom according to their deposition sequence  as first determined on terrestrial strata by nicolas steno  for example  stratigraphic mapping prepared the apollo astronauts for the field geology they would encounter on their lunar missions  overlapping sequences were identified on images taken by the lunar orbiter program  and these were used to prepare a lunar stratigraphic column and geological map of the moon one of the main problems when generating hypotheses on the formation and evolution of objects in the solar system is the lack of samples that can be analysed in the laboratory  where a large suite of tools are available and the full body of knowledge derived from terrestrial geology can be brought to bear  fortunately  direct samples from the moon  asteroids and mars are present on earth  removed from their parent bodies and delivered as meteorites  some of these have suffered contamination from the oxidising effect of earth s atmosphere and the infiltration of the biosphere  but those meteorites collected in the last few decades from antarctica are almost entirely pristine the different types of meteorites that originate from the asteroid belt cover almost all parts of the structure of differentiated bodies  meteorites even exist that come from the core-mantle  boundary  pallasites   the combination of geochemistry and observational astronomy has also made it possible to trace the hed meteorites back to a specific asteroid in the main belt  4  vesta the comparatively few known martian meteorites have provided insight into the geochemical composition of the martian crust  although the unavoidable lack of information about their points of origin on the diverse martian surface has meant that they do not provide more detailed constraints on theories of the evolution of the martian as of july 24,  2013  65  samples of martian meteorites have been discovered on earth  many were found in either antarctica or the sahara desert during the apollo era  in the apollo program  384  kilograms of lunar samples were collected and transported to the earth  and 3  soviet luna robots also delivered regolith samples from the moon  these samples provide the most comprehensive record of the composition of any solar system body beside the earth  the numbers of lunar meteorites are growing quickly in the last few years as of april 2008  there are 54  meteorites that have been officially classified as lunar  eleven of these are from the us antarctic meteorite collection  6  are from the japanese antarctic meteorite collection  and the other 37  are from hot desert localities in africa  australia  and the middle east  the total mass of recognized lunar meteorites is close to 50  kg space probes made it possible to collect data in not only the visible light region  but in other areas of the electromagnetic spectrum  the planets can be characterized by their force fields  gravity and their magnetic fields  which are studied through geophysics and space physics measuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the gravity fields of the planets to be mapped  for example  in the 1970s,  the gravity field disturbances above lunar maria were measured through lunar orbiters  which led to the discovery of concentrations of mass  mascons  beneath the imbrium  serenitatis  crisium  nectaris and humorum basins if a planet s magnetic field is sufficiently strong  its interaction with the solar wind forms a magnetosphere around a planet  early space probes discovered the gross dimensions of the terrestrial magnetic field  which extends about 10  earth radii towards the sun  the solar wind  a stream of charged particles  streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field  and continues behind the magnetic tail  hundreds of earth radii downstream  inside the magnetosphere  there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles  the van allen radiation belts geophysics includes seismology and tectonophysics  geophysical fluid dynamics  mineral physics  geodynamics  mathematical geophysics  and geophysical surveying geodesy  also called geodetics  deals with the measurement and representation of the planets of the solar system  their gravitational fields and geodynamic phenomena  polar motion in three-dimensional,  time-varying  space  the science of geodesy has elements of both astrophysics and planetary sciences  the shape of the earth is to a large extent the result of its rotation  which causes its equatorial bulge  and the competition of geologic processes such as the collision of plates and of vulcanism  resisted by the earth s gravity field  these principles can be applied to the solid surface of earth  orogeny  few mountains are higher than 10  km (6  mi   few deep sea trenches deeper than that because quite simply  a mountain as tall as  for example  15  km (9  mi   would develop so much pressure at its base  due to gravity  that the rock there would become plastic  and the mountain would slump back to a height of roughly 10  km (6  mi  in a geologically insignificant time  some or all of these geologic principles can be applied to other planets besides earth  for instance on mars  whose surface gravity is much less  the largest volcano  olympus mons  is 27  km (17  mi  high at its peak  a height that could not be maintained on earth  the earth geoid is essentially the figure of the earth abstracted from its topographic features  therefore  the mars geoid is essentially the figure of mars abstracted from its topographic features  surveying and mapping are two important fields of application of geodesy the atmosphere is an important transitional zone between the solid planetary surface and the higher rarefied ionizing and radiation belts  not all planets have atmospheres  their existence depends on the mass of the planet  and the planet s distance from the sun — too distant and frozen atmospheres occur  besides the four gas giant planets  almost all of the terrestrial planets  earth  venus  and mars  have significant atmospheres  two moons have significant atmospheres  saturn s moon titan and neptune s moon triton  a tenuous atmosphere exists around mercury the effects of the rotation rate of a planet about its axis can be seen in atmospheric streams and currents  seen from space  these features show as bands and eddies in the cloud system  and are particularly visible on jupiter and saturn planetary science frequently makes use of the method of comparison to give a greater understanding of the object of study  this can involve comparing the dense atmospheres of earth and saturn s moon titan  the evolution of outer solar system objects at different distances from the sun  or the geomorphology of the surfaces of the terrestrial planets  to give only a few examples the main comparison that can be made is to features on the earth  as it is much more accessible and allows a much greater range of measurements to be made  earth analogue studies are particularly common in planetary geology  geomorphology  and also in atmospheric science smaller workshops and conferences on particular fields occur worldwide throughout the year this non-exhaustive  list includes those institutions and universities with major groups of people working in planetary science  alphabetical order is used
