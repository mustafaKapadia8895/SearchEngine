 settlement of the americas -  wikipediathe continents of north and south america were settled by natives from asia between 10  and 20  thousand years ago after they crossed a land bridge that formed between alaska and far northeastern siberia due to the lowering of sea level during the last ice age  available scientific evidence indicates that modern humans emerged from africa over 100,000  years ago  yet did not arrive in the americas until less than 20,000  years ago  current understanding of the settlement of the americas derives from advances in four interrelated disciplines  archaeology  pleistocene geology  physical anthropology  and dna analysis  while there is general agreement that the americas were first settled from asia  the pattern of migration  its timing  and the place s  of origin in asia of the peoples who migrated to the americas remain in the 2000s,  researchers sought to use familiar tools to validate or reject established theories  such as clovis the archeological evidence suggests that the paleo-indians'  first dispersal into the americas occurred near the end of the last glacial period or  more specifically  what is known as the last glacial maximum  lgm   around 16,500–13,000  years settlement of the americas is of intense interest to archaeologists and anthropologists  modern biochemical techniques  as well as the accumulation of archaeological and geological evidence  have shed progressively more light on the subject  however  significant questions remain an introduction to the radiocarbon dating techniques used by archaeologists and geologists

that these cycles after about 45k  years bp lasted anywhere from hundreds to between one and two thousand years  with greater duration of cold periods starting around 32k  cal years the pollen record

agreement that the americas were settled by migrants from northeastern asian populations  the chronology of the migrations  the source populations that contributed to the migrations  and their migration routes remain uncertain  the uncertainty is fed by a lack of archaeological evidence along migration routes that date to the periods when those migrations are proposed to have occurred  uncertainties in the dating and interpretation of the oldest proposed archaeosites in the americas  and uncertainties of assumptions underlying chronological and source models of migration derived from studies of modern native american genetics in the early 21st  century  the models of the chronology of migration are divided into two general the first is the short chronology theory  that the first migration occurred after the last glacial maximum  which went into decline after about 19,000  years and was then followed by successive waves of the second theory is the long chronology theory  which proposes that the first group of people entered the americas at a much earlier date  possibly 21,000–40,000  years followed by a much later second wave of further controversy has been generated as age-dating  of archaeosites in the and the timing of the opening of the ice-free  have challenged the clovis first theory  which dominated thinking on new world anthropology for much of the 20th  century.pre-last  glacial maximum migration across beringia into the americas has been proposed to explain purported pre-lgm  ages of archaeosites in the americas such as bluefish and old crow in the yukon territory  and meadowcroft rock shelter in the earlier 14c  date from a bone artifact at the old crow flats site has been supplanted by an accelerator mass spectrometry 14c  date that indicates a holocene the interpretations of butcher marks and the geologic association of bones at the bluefish cave and old crow flats sites have been called into the ages of the earliest positively identified artifacts at the meadowcroft site are constrained by a compiled age estimate from 14c  in the range of 12k-15k  14c  years bp (13.8k-18.5k  cal years the meadowcroft rockshelter site and the monte

hammerstones and anvils  have been found in southern california  at the cerutti mastodon site  that are associated with a mastodon skeleton which appeared to have been processed by humans  the mastodon skeleton was dated by thorium-230/uranium  radiometric analysis  using diffusion–adsorption–decay dating models  to 130.7  ± 9.4  thousand years no human bones were found  and the claims of tools and bone processing have been described as  not michael r  waters commented that  to demonstrate such early occupation of the americas requires the presence of unequivocal stone artefacts  there are no unequivocal stone tools associated with the bones    this site is likely just an interesting paleontological locality   chris stringer said that  extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence -  each aspect requires the strongest scrutiny   adding that  high and concentrated forces must have been required to smash the thickest mastodon bones  and the low energy depositional environment seemingly provides no obvious alternative to humans using the heavy cobbles found with the yana river rhino horn site  rhs  has dated human occupation of eastern arctic siberia to 27k  14c

date to 12k  14c  years bp (14k  cal years it is possible that a small founder population had entered beringia before that time  however  archaeosites that date closer to the last glacial maximum on either the siberian or the alaskan side of beringia are lacking recent studies of amerindian genetics have used high resolution analytical techniques applied to dna samples from modern native americans and asian populations regarded as their source populations to reconstruct the development of human y-chromosome  dna haplogroups  ydna haplogroups  and human mitochondrial dna haplogroups  mtdna haplogroups  characteristic of native american models of molecular evolution rates are used to estimate the ages at which native american dna lineages branched off from their parent lineages in asia and to deduce the ages of demographic events  one model based on native american mtdna haplotypes  figure 2)  proposes that migration into beringia occurred between 30k  and 25k  cal years bp  with migration into the americas occurring around 10k  to 15k  years after isolation of the small founding another model  figure 3)  proposes that migration into beringia occurred approximately 36k  cal years bp  followed by 20k  years of isolation in yet another model proposes that migration into beringia occurred between 40k  and 30k  cal years bp  with a pre-lgm  migration into the americas followed by isolation of the northern population following closure of the ice-free  the three native american mtdna evolution rate models all fall within the long chronology theory of migration into the americas a study of the diversification of mtdna haplogroups c and d from southern siberia and eastern asia  respectively  suggests that the parent lineage  subhaplogroup d4h)  of subhaplogroup d4h3,  a lineage found among native americans and han emerged around 20k  cal years bp  constraining the emergence of d4h3  to age estimates based on y-chromosome  micro-satellite  diversity place origin of the american haplogroup q1a3a  (y-dna)  at around 10k  to 15k  cal years greater consistency of dna molecular evolution rate models with each other and with archaeological data may be gained by the use of dated fossil dna to calibrate molecular evolution is general agreement among anthropologists that the source populations for the migration into the americas originated from an area somewhere east of the yenisei river  the common occurrence of the mtdna haplogroups a  b  c  and d among eastern asian and native american populations has long been recognized  along with the presence of haplogroup as a whole  the greatest frequency of the four native american associated haplogroups occurs in the altai-baikal  region of southern some subclades of c and d closer to the native american subclades occur among mongolian  amur  japanese  korean  and ainu development of high-resolution  genomic analysis has provided opportunities to further define native american subclades and narrow the range of asian subclades that may be parent or sister subclades  for example  the broad geographic range of haplogroup x has been interpreted as allowing the possibility of a western eurasian  or even a european source population for native americans  as in the solutrean hypothesis  or suggesting a pre-last  glacial maximum migration into the the analysis of an ancient variant of haplogroup x among aboriginals of the altai region indicates common ancestry with the european strain rather than descent from the european further division of x subclades has allowed identification of subhaplogroup x2a,  which is regarded as specific to native with further definition of subclades related to native american populations  the requirements for sampling asian populations to find the most closely related subclades grow more specific  subhaplogroups d1  and d4h3  have been regarded as native american specific based on their absence among a large sampling of populations regarded as potential descendants of source populations  over a wide area of among the 3764  samples  the sakhalin -  lower amur region was represented by 61  in another study  subhaplogroup d1a  has been identified among the ulchis of the lower amur river region(4  among 87  sampled  or 4.6%),  along with subhaplogroup c1a  (1  among 87,  or subhaplogroup c1a  is regarded as a close sister clade of the native american subhaplogroup subhaplogroup d1a  has also been found among ancient jōmon skeletons from the modern ainu are regarded as descendants of the the occurrence of the subhaplogroups d1a  and c1a  in the lower amur region suggests a source population from that region distinct from the altai-baikal  source populations  where sampling did not reveal those two particular the conclusions regarding subhaplogroup d1  indicating potential source populations in the lower and areas stand in contrast to the single-source  migration d4h3  has been identified among han subhaplogroup d4h3  from china does not have the same geographic implication as subhaplotype d1a  from amur-hokkaido,  so its implications for source models are more speculative  its parent lineage  subhaplotype d4h,  is believed to have emerged in east asia  rather than siberia  around 20k  cal years subhaplogroup d4h2,  a sister clade of d4h3,  has also been found among jōmon skeletons from d4h3  has a coastal trace in the contrast between the genetic profiles of the hokkaido jōmon skeletons and the modern ainu illustrates another uncertainty in source models derived from modern dna probably due to the small sample size or close consanguinity among the members of the site  the frequencies of the haplogroups in funadomari skeletons were quite different from any modern populations  including hokkaido ainu  who have been regarded as the direct descendant of the hokkaido jomon people the descendants of source populations with the closest relationship to the genetic profile from the time when differentiation occurred are not obvious  source population models can be expected to become more robust as more results are compiled  the heritage of modern proxy candidates becomes better understood  and fossil dna in the regions of interest is found and considered the human t cell lymphotrophic virus 1  (htlv-1)  is a virus transmitted through exchange of bodily fluids and from mother to child through breast milk  the mother-to-child  transmission mimics a hereditary trait  although such transmission from maternal carriers is less than the htlv virus genome has been mapped  allowing identification of four major strains and analysis of their antiquity through mutations  the highest geographic concentrations of the strain hltv-1  are in sub-saharan  africa and in japan  it occurs in its highest concentration on it is also present among african descendants and native populations in the caribbean region and south it is rare in central america and north its distribution in the americas has been regarded as due to importation with the slave ainu have developed antibodies to htlv-1,  indicating its endemicity to the ainu and its antiquity in a subtype  a  has been defined and identified among the japanese  including ainu   and among caribbean and south american a subtype  b  has been identified in japan and in 1995,  native americans in coastal british columbia were found to have both subtypes a and bone marrow specimens from an andean mummy about 1500  years old were reported to have shown the presence of the a the finding ignited controversy  with contention that the sample dna was insufficiently complete for the conclusion and that the result reflected modern however  a re-analysis  indicated that the dna sequences were consistent with  but not definitely from  the  cosmopolitan clade   subtype the presence of subtypes a and b in the americas is suggestive of a native american source population related to the ainu ancestors  the jōmon paleoamerican skeletons in the americas such as kennewick man  washington state   hoya negro skeleton  yucatán   luzia woman and other skulls from the lagoa santa site  brazil   buhl woman  idaho   peñon woman two skulls from the tlapacoya site  mexico and 33  skulls from baja have exhibited craniofacial traits distinct from most modern native americans  leading physical anthropologists to the opinion that some paleoamericans were of an australoid rather than siberian the most basic measured distinguishing trait is the dolichocephaly of the skull  some modern isolates such as the pericúes of baja california and the fuegians of tierra del fuego exhibit that same morphological other anthropologists advocate an alternative hypothesis that evolution of an original beringian phenotype gave rise to a distinct morphology that was similar in all known paleoamerican skulls  followed by later convergence towards the modern native american resolution of the issue awaits the identification of a beringian phenotype among paleoamerican skulls or evidence of a genetic clustering among examples of the australoid phenotype a report published in the american journal of physical anthropology in january 2015  reviewed craniofacial variation focussing on differences between early and late native americans and explanations for these based on either skull morphology or molecular genetics  arguments based on molecular genetics have in the main  according to the authors  accepted a single migration from asia with a probable pause in berengia  plus later bi-directional  gene flow  studies focussing on craniofacial morphology have argued that paleoamerican remains have  been described as much closer to african and australo-melanesians  populations than to the modern series of native americans   suggesting two entries into the americas  an early one occurring before a distinctive east asian morphology developed  referred to in the paper as the  two components model   a third model  the  recurrent gene flow  model  attempts to reconcile the two  arguing that circumarctic gene flow after the initial migration could account for morphological changes  it specifically re-evaluates  the original report on the hoya negro skeleton which supported the rgf model  the authors disagreed with the original conclusion which suggested that the skull shape did not match those of modern native americans  arguing that the  skull falls into a subregion of the morphospace occupied by both paleoamericans and some modern native points are a lithic technology distinct from beringian and clovis types  they have a distribution ranging from coastal east asia to the pacific coast of south the emergence of stemmed points has been traced to korea during the upper the origin and distribution of stemmed points have been interpreted as a cultural marker related to a source population from coastal east theories about migration into the americas have centered on migration from beringia through the interior of north america  the discovery of artifacts in association with pleistocene faunal remains near clovis  new mexico in the early 1930s  required extension of the timeframe for the settlement of north america to the period during which glaciers were still extensive  that led to the hypothesis of a migration route between the laurentide and cordilleran ice sheets to explain the early settlement  the clovis site was host to a lithic technology characterized by spear points with an indentation  or flute  where the point was attached to the shaft  a lithic complex characterized by the clovis point technology was subsequently identified over much of north america and in south america  the association of clovis complex technology with late pleistocene faunal remains led to the theory that it marked the arrival of big game hunters that migrated out of beringia then dispersed throughout the americas  otherwise known as the clovis first theory recent radiocarbon dating of clovis sites has yielded ages of 11.1k  to 10.7k  14c  years bp (13k  to 12.6k  cal years bp   somewhat later than dates derived from older the re-evaluation  of earlier radiocarbon dates led to the conclusion that no fewer than 11  of the 22  clovis sites with radiocarbon dates are  problematic  and should be disregarded  including the type site in clovis  new mexico  numerical dating of clovis sites has allowed comparison of clovis dates with dates of other archaeosites throughout the americas  and of the opening of the ice-free  corridor  both lead to significant challenges to the clovis first theory  the monte verde site of southern chile has been dated at 14.8k  cal years the paisley cave site in eastern oregon yielded a 14c  date of 12.4k  years (14.5k  cal years  bp  on a coprolite with human dna and 14c  dates of 11.3k-11k  (13.2k-12.9k  cal years  bp on horizons containing western stemmed artifact horizons with non-clovis  lithic assemblages and pre-clovis  ages occur in eastern north america  although the maximum ages tend to be poorly findings on the timing of the ice-free  corridor also challenge the notion that clovis and pre-clovis  human occupation of the americas was a result of migration through that route following the last glacial maximum  pre-lgm  closing of the corridor may approach 30k  cal years bp and estimates of ice retreat from the corridor are in the range of 12  to 13k  cal years viability of the corridor as a human migration route has been estimated at 11.5k  cal years bp  later than the ages of the clovis and pre-clovis  dated clovis archaeosites suggest a south-to-north  spread of the clovis glacial maximum migration into the interior has been proposed to explain pre-clovis  ages for archaeosites in the although pre-clovis  sites such as meadowcroft rock monte and paisley cave have not yielded confirmed pre-lgm  ages the interior route is consistent with the spread of the na dene language group and subhaplogroup x2a  into the americas after the earliest paleoamerican models propose that people first reached the americas via water travel  following coastlines from northeast asia into the americas  coastlines are unusually productive environments because they provide humans with access to a diverse array of plants and animals from both terrestrial and marine ecosystems  while not exclusive of land-based  migrations  the pacific  coastal migration theory  helps explain how early colonists reached areas extremely distant from the bering strait region  including sites such as monte verde in southern chile and taima-taima  in western venezuela  two cultural components were discovered at monte verde near the pacific coast of chile  the youngest layer is radiocarbon dated at 12,500

33,000  years  but few scholars currently accept this very early needed as the chronology of deglaciation in the interior and coastal regions of north america became better understood  the coastal migration hypothesis was advanced by knute fladmark as an alternative to the ice-free  corridor debate on coastal versus interior migration for initial settlement has centered on evidence for chronology of initial settlement of interior north the pacific coast of the and timing of the opening of coastal versus interior migration routes indicated by geological complicating the debate has been the absence of archaeological data from the coastal and interior migration routes from the periods when the initial migration is proposed to have occurred  a recent variation of the coastal migration hypothesis is the marine migration hypothesis  which proposes that migrants with boats settled in coastal refugia during deglaciation of the the proposed use of boats adds a measure of flexibility to the chronology of coastal migration  as a continuous ice-free  coast (16k-15k  cal years bp  would no longer be required  a coastal east asian source population is integral to the marine migration 2014,  the autosomal dna of a toddler from montana  dated at 10.7k  14c  years (12.5-12.7  cal years  bp was the dna was taken from a skeleton referred to as anzick-1,  found in close association with several clovis artifacts  the analysis yielded identification of the mtdna as belonging to subhaplogroup d4h3a,  a rare subclade of d4h3  occurring along the west coast of the americas  as well as geneflow related to the siberian mal ta population  the data indicate that anzick-1  is from a population directly ancestral to present south american and central american native american populations  anzick-1  is less closely related to present north american native american populations  d4h3a  has been identified as a clade associated with coastal problems associated with finding archaeological evidence for migration during a period of lowered sea level are well sites related to the first migration are usually submerged  so the location of such sites is obscured  certain types of evidence dependent on organic material  such as radiocarbon dating  may be destroyed by submergence  wave action can destroy site structures and scatter artifacts along a prograding shoreline  additionally  pacific coastal conditions tend to be unstable due to steep unstable terrain  earthquakes  tsunamis  and volcanoes  strategies for finding earliest migration sites include identifying potential sites on submerged paleoshorelines  seeking sites in areas uplifted either by tectonics or isostatic rebound  and looking for riverine sites in areas that may have attracted coastal otherwise  coastal archaeology is dependent on secondary evidence related to lifestyles and technologies of maritime peoples from sites similar to those that would be associated with the original migration other coastal models  dealing specifically with the peopling of the pacific northwest and california coasts  have been advocated by archaeologists knut fladmark  roy carlson  james dixon  jon erlandson  ruth gruhn  and daryl fedje  in a 2007  article in the journal of island and coastal archaeology  erlandson and his colleagues proposed a corollary to the coastal migration theory—the  kelp highway hypothesis —arguing that productive kelp forests supporting similar suites of plants and animals would have existed near the end of the pleistocene around much of the pacific rim from japan to beringia  the pacific northwest  and california  as well as the andean coast of south america  once the coastlines of alaska and british columbia had deglaciated about 16,000  years ago  these kelp forest  along with estuarine  mangrove  and coral reef  habitats would have provided an ecologically similar migration corridor  entirely at sea level  and essentially unobstructed a

 could have then skirted the tidewater glaciers in canada right on down the coast  64]'the  coastal migration models provide a different perspective on migration to the new world  but they are not without their own problems  one of the biggest needed  is that global sea levels have risen over 120  metres (390  since the end of the last glacial period  and this has submerged the ancient coastlines that maritime people would have followed into the americas  finding sites associated with early coastal migrations is extremely difficult—and systematic excavation of any sites found in deeper waters is challenging and expensive  on the other hand  there is evidence of marine technologies found in the hills of the channel islands of california  circa 10,000  if there was an early pre-clovis  coastal migration  there is always the possibility of a  failed colonization   another problem that arises is the lack of hard evidence found for a  long chronology  theory  no sites have yet produced a consistent chronology older than about 12,500  radiocarbon years (~14,500  calendar needed   but research has been limited in south america related to the possibility of early coastal migrations the micro-satellite  diversity and distribution of a y lineage specific to south america suggest that certain amerindian populations became isolated after the initial colonization of their
