 1932  atlantic hurricane season -  wikipediathe 1932  atlantic hurricane season was the period during 1932  in which tropical cyclones formed in the atlantic basin  it was a relatively active season  with fifteen known storms  six hurricanes  and four major 1]  two storms attained category 5  intensity  the first known occurrence in which multiple category 5  hurricanes formed in the same year  the season began with the formation of tropical storm one on may 5,  and ended with the dissipation of hurricane fourteen  also known as the 1932  cuba hurricane  on november 14.  tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes  especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration  may have remained undetected  because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s,  historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable  the atlantic hurricane reanalysis project discovered four new tropical cyclones  all of which were tropical storms  that occurred during the year  these storms were later added to the hurdat total  the season resulted in at least 3,384  fatalities and at least $77.706  million in 2]  a strong hurricane struck freeport  texas in mid–august  severely affecting a large swath of the coast  a category 5  hurricane  the first of the season  devastated areas of the bahamas  especially the abaco islands  another strong category 4  hurricane struck puerto rico in late september  leaving catastrophic damage and causing $30  million in damages  a second category 5  hurricane in early november became one of the deadliest hurricanes of the 20th  century after making landfall on cuba and killing at least 3,103  people  a hurricane and four other tropical storms made landfalls during the season a tropical depression formed on may 5  in the south-central  caribbean  moving slowly northeast  the system became a tropical storm the next day and gradually strengthened before making landfall on hispaniola with winds of 50  miles per hour (80  km h  on may 7.  the system crossed the dominican republic  emerging into the western atlantic on may 8  as it continued to strengthen  reaching its peak intensity of 65  mph (105  km h  on may 10  while centered south-southwest  of bermuda  the diffuse system later transitioned into an extratropical storm the same day  later dissipating on may 11  well to the northwest of bermuda after merging with a frontal freeport hurricane of 1932a  tropical storm formed on august 11  in the southern gulf of mexico near the yucatán peninsula  moving northward over the southern gulf of mexico on the 12th,  it rapidly intensified from a category 1  to a category 4  hurricane with winds estimated at 150  mph (240  km h  and an estimated central pressure of 935  mb (27.6  inhg  shortly before making landfall near freeport  texas  on august the eye of the compact storm crossed the coast about 10  p m  cdt on august 13,  creating a 40–30  mi (64–48  km  wide path of heavy destruction in brazoria county  texas  the lowest barometric pressure recorded was 27.83  inches (938  mbar  in velasco in brazoria county  official warning on the storm began just four hours prior to the storm s landfall  and many people evacuating inland were forced to abandon their cars in high winds and heavy galveston  texas  power to electrical and phone service was cut off  temporarily reducing communications  the passage between galveston island and mainland texas was flooded  temporarily cutting off galveston from the mainland  heavy rains occurred  and a foot of rain fell as the storm moved north towards the 40  people were killed by the hurricane  the greatest single death toll for any town was seven in west columbia  texas  where sustained winds over 100  mph (160  km h  flattened several homes  two neighborhoods that had been constructed for oil industry workers there were nearly destroyed by the high tides and storm surge  freeport  angleton and galveston suffered extensive wind damage  and the inland towns of brazoria  west columbia  damon and needville  all in the path of the eye  were also devastated  damages associated with the hurricane were estimated to total to $7.5  tropical disturbance was first identified north of hispaniola on august 26.  slowly moving towards the west-northwest,  it intensified to tropical storm strength before making landfall on south florida early on august 30.  after crossing the florida peninsula and entering the gulf of mexico  the system reached peak intensity as a category 1  hurricane with winds of 85  mph (137  km h   before subsequently making its final landfall near the mississippi–alabama border on september 1  at peak over land  the hurricane weakened  and after becoming an extratropical cyclone on september 2,  the storm merged with another extratropical system over quebec on september the storm s initial landfall in southern florida  heavy rains and strong winds caused extensive damage to crops  particularly to avocado and citrus  as the strengthening hurricane moved northwestwards through the gulf of mexico  it generated strong surf that caused severe damage to coastal areas across western before making its second landfall  where it produced hurricane force winds across a wide swath of the agricultural lands in coastal regions of mississippi and alabama were damaged by strong winds and heavy the hurricane caused one indirect death and $226,000  in total damages across its path the great bahamas hurricane of 1932  or hurricane san ciprián of 1932a  tropical depression was first detected north of the virgin islands late on august 30.  moving towards the west-northwest,  the depression steadily intensified  reaching tropical storm strength and later hurricane strength on september 2,  as it passed near the turks and caicos after reaching hurricane intensity  the hurricane began to rapidly becoming a major hurricane on september 4.  the intensifying hurricane moved through the bahamas and reached peak intensity as a category 5  hurricane  the first of the season  with maximum sustained winds of 160  mph (260  km h   afterwards  the hurricane slowly weakened as it recurved towards the north and subsequently northeast  bypassing new england before becoming extratropical on september 9.  the extratropical cyclone traversed across iceland and later dissipated on september hurricane caused extensive devastation across much of the bahamas  where it killed 16  people and injured an additional 300  strong winds destroyed numerous homes and hampered water and food supplies  the large hurricane also generated a strong storm surge which inundated the abaco effects of the hurricane in the united states were much less severe  due to the far proximity of the hurricane  however  strong gales still swept through much of new september 4,  an area of low pressure developed from a stationary front over the open atlantic ocean  at the time  a warm front and cold front were connected to the system  but further observations revealed minimal temperature deviations  the following day  the disturbance appeared to have acquired subtropical characteristics  but became tropical after observations showed that winds associated with the storm were near the center  the storm later weakened and was absorbed by a frontal boundary at 1800  utc on september tropical storm first formed in the bay of campeche on september moving slowly the tropical storm reached its peak intensity of 60  mph (97  km h  while located south of the mississippi river beginning on september 14,  the storm began to accelerate as it turned towards the and subsequently made landfall at peak intensity near st  marks in the big bend of florida at 0400  utc on september 15.  the storm crossed the peninsula in only six hours  before becoming extratropical at 12000  utc later that the extratropical cyclone quickly accelerated parallel to the united states east coast  before being absorbed by another extratropical system over due to the tropical storm s quick passage over the florida peninsula  damage was relatively a train crossed over a washout on its railroad  causing it to in apalachicola  there was considerable damage to crops  and torrential rains caused $2,000  in electric power in the city was also disabled  and some buildings suffered structural damage  totaling to $8,000  in september 16,  a tropical storm with winds of 40  mph (64  km h  developed out of a frontal boundary in the central north moving slowly towards the gales were reported by ships in the region as the tropical storm slowly on september 20,  the storm began to move towards the southwest  the system reached peak intensity on september 21,  with winds of 65  mph (105  km h   before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone as it recurved northwards on september the extratropical cyclone later made landfall on nova scotia the following day  before dissipating over greenland on september tropical depression was first identified on september 18  in the bay of campeche  moving quickly towards the north-northeast,  the depression intensified to a tropical storm and reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65  mph (105  km h  and a minimum pressure of 998  mbar (29.5  inhg  early the next the storm subsequently made landfall near morgan city  louisiana at 1900  utc on september weakening over land  the tropical storm degenerated to a tropical depression at 1200  utc on september 20,  before becoming extratropical the next day west of louisville  kentucky and later dissipating after it was absorbed by an approaching the storm made landfall in a sparsely populated region of louisiana  only minimal damage was reported  prior to the storm s landfall  however  hedge selling of cotton were offset in late dealings caused by fears of the storm s potential a tornado was reported in west baton rouge parish  blowing down sugarcane along a path 8  mi (13  km  further inland  heavy rains associated with the system were reported  peaking at 3.01  in (76  mm  in vicksburg  san ciprián of 1932on  september 25,  ships first noted a tropical storm east of the leeward islands  the tropical storm quickly intensified as it moved towards the west due to a nearby high pressure system  reaching hurricane strength at 0600  utc that day  as it approached puerto rico  the hurricane continued to rapidly intensify  before reaching its peak intensity as a category 4  hurricane with winds of 145  mph (233  km h  and a minimum pressure of 943  mbar (27.8  inhg  on september 27,  before making landfall near ceiba  puerto rico at 0300  the hurricane slightly weakened over the island  and after crossing the mona passage  made a second landfall in southern areas of the dominican republic as a category 2  hurricane  its passage of hispaniola significantly weakened the hurricane  downgrading it to tropical strength  after brushing jamaica to the south  the tropical storm struggled to organize  and did not strengthen up until landfall on british honduras with winds of 45  mph (72  km h  and an estimated minimum pressure of 1,003  mbar (29.6  inhg  october there  the storm quickly weakened  and dissipated over southeastern mexico on october hurricane was considered the worst to affect puerto rico since the 1928  okeechobee strong storm surge and winds devastated areas of the island winds also knocked out communications systems  hampering relief additional rainfall also inundated numerous in puerto rico  the hurricane killed 257  hurricane  and caused $30  million in tropical storm was first identified in the eastern atlantic on september 28  as a small  compact with winds of 40  mph (64  km h   moving slowly towards the southeast  the storm was able to slightly intensify to a peak intensity of 45  mph (72  before interacting with an extratropical cyclone and later being absorbed by it by 0600  utc on september tropical depression first formed on october 7  from a broad low-pressure  area in the central caribbean sea northeast of moving slowly to the the depression steadily intensified  reaching tropical storm strength at 1200  utc the same day  the storm continued to intensify as it moved towards the yucatán peninsula  reaching peak intensity late on october 9,  with maximum sustained wind speeds of 70  mph (110  the storm made landfall near playa del carmen at 0400  utc the next day  while still at peak over land  the storm degenerated into a tropical depression on october 11  as it began to curve towards the north  the depression later reentered the gulf of mexico the following  where it began to restrengthen  by 1200  utc on october 13,  the elongated system regained tropical storm strength  before reaching a secondary peak intensity of 60  mph (97  however  baroclinic forces caused the storm to become extratropical prior to making landfall on the louisiana coast in the afternoon of october 15.  the extratropical remnants of the storm continued to trek to the northeast  before it merged with another extratropical approaching storm forced storm warnings to be issued for several areas of the gulf coast from brownsville  texas to apalachicola  florida  its extratropical remnants brought gale–force winds to portions of offshore  a cargo ship carrying asphalt sunk due to strong waves  causing $30,000  in in addition heavy rains caused rivers to exceed flood stage  particularly east of where the storm made isolating homes and interrupting traffic  black warrior river exceeded its flood stage by 14  ft (4.3  m   and the catawba river also a peak rainfall of 8.5  in (220  mm  was reported during a 17‑hour  period in tuscaloosa  alabama  the storm also brought widespread rainfall across the south atlantic states through orographic lift  peaking at 9.3  in (240  mm  in rock house  north washout from the rains also caused a train tropical depression was first identified on october 8  northeast of the virgin islands and quickly intensified to a tropical storm  moving towards the west and then northwest  the storm intensified to its peak intensity of 60  mph (97  km h  at 1800  utc on october 10  as it neared the lowest pressure recorded in bermuda was 1,002  mbar (29.6  inhg   which was associated with minimal tropical storm force the storm weakened as it progressed further northwards and curved towards the northeast  before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone by 0600  utc on october the system was absorbed by a strong cold frontal boundary later that october 17,  a stationary front positioned over the eastern atlantic began to dissipate  and a large area of low pressure began to form along the front boundary  the disturbance intensified to tropical storm strength at 0000  utc on october 18,  after losing baroclinity  as it moved towards the the system slowly intensified to an estimated peak intensity of 70  mph (110  km h  at 0600  utc on october 19,  as suggested by a nearby ship that also reported 70  mph (110  km h  at the same time  the tropical storm also began to curve more towards the east  and subsequently began to weaken  the system degenerated to tropical depression strength on october 21,  and shortly after great cuba hurricane of 1932a  tropical storm formed on october 30  in the atlantic ocean east of the virgin islands  it was upgraded to hurricane strength on november 1  as it headed southwest into the caribbean  it was upgraded to category 2  status on november 3  with winds of 100  mph (160  km h   the storm strengthened into a major hurricane on november 4,  and continued to intensify  peaking as an intense category 5  hurricane with a central pressure at or below 915  mb (27.02  inhg  on november 5  in the western caribbean  the storm later weakened slightly and struck central cuba on november 9  with winds of 150  mph (240  km h  and a central pressure of 918  mb (27.11  inhg   later weakening to a category 3  hurricane after crossing the the storm continued to slowly weaken as it moved through the bahamas the following day  later weakening to a tropical storm and becoming an extratropical storm the next day over the central north atlantic  the storm caused severe damage and a total of 3,033  deaths in tropical storm was first identified in the central atlantic at 0600  utc on november with ships reporting moderate gales in its vicinity  throughout its existence  the storm moved in an erratic path  generally to the steadily intensifying  the tropical storm attained hurricane strength at 1800  utc on november 6,  as it began to move towards the northeast towards the azores  the hurricane continued to intensify  attaining category 2  intensity on november 8  and at the same time reaching its peak intensity with winds of 100  mph (160  km h   after reaching peak intensity  a weakening trend began as the storm accelerated towards the northeast  early on november 10,  it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone  while still maintaining winds of hurricane the extratropical system continued to quickly move towards the northeast  until it coalesced with another extratropical cyclone on november following table lists all of the storms that formed in the 1932  atlantic hurricane season  it includes their duration  names  areas affected  damages  and death totals  deaths in parentheses are indirect  an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident   but were still related to that storm  damage and deaths include totals from the storm s precursor and its remnants  and all of the damage figures are in 1932  usd at peak intensity
