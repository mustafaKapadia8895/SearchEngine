 eastern oyster -  wikipediathe eastern oyster  crassostrea virginica —also called wellfleet atlantic oyster  virginia oyster  or american oyster—is a species of true oyster native to the eastern seaboard and gulf of mexico coast of north america  it is also farmed in puget sound  washington  where it is known as the totten inlet eastern oysters are and have been very popular commercially  today  less than 1%  of the original 17th-century  population  when the original colonists arrived  is thought to remain in the chesapeake bay and its although population estimates from any era are uncertain  the eastern oyster is the state shellfish of its shell is the state shell of virginia and mississippi  and its shell in cabochon form is the state gem of all oysters  crassostrea virginica is a bivalve mollusk with a hard calcium-carbonaceous  shell  its shell provides protection from predation this particular type of oyster has an important environmental value  like all oysters  c  virginica is a filter feeder  they suck in water and filter out the plankton and detritus to swallow  then spit the water back out  thus cleaning the water around them  one oyster can filter more than 50  gallons of water in 24  eastern oysters also provide a key structural element within their ecosystem  making them a foundation species in many environments  and they serve as ecosystem engineers in western atlantic similar to coral reefs  oyster beds provide key habitat for a variety of different species by creating hard substrate for attachment and oyster beds have an estimated 50  times the surface area of an equally sized flat bottom  the beds also attract a high concentration of larger predators looking for eastern oyster  like all members of the family ostreidae  can make small pearls to surround particles that enter the shell  these pearls  however  are insignificant in size and of no value  the pearl oyster  from which commercial pearls are harvested  is of a different family the lifecycle of c  virginica is  spawning  floating fertilized egg  trochophore  swimming straight-hinge  veliger  swimming late veliger  swimming and crawling pediveliger  early spat  later spat  and adult spawning of c  virginica is controlled by water temperatures and varies from north to south  northern oysters spawn at temperatures between 60  and 68  °f (15.5  and 20  °c   whereas southern oysters spawn at temperatures above 68  °f (20  °c   spawning can also occur throughout the warm oysters can reach sexual maturity at four months the eastern oyster has a complex reproductive cycle  the cycle begins during late summer and autumn months with the storage of glycogen energy this glycogen is then used to support gametogenesis during the next winter and early spring when food intake is at a the gametes begin to mature in late spring and then  from june to august they are spawned into the water column  where fertilization each female produces from 75  to 150  million eggs  but only one in 1000  then  fertilized eggs develop into planktonic  free-swimming,  trochophore larvae  also known as the early umbo stage  which have cilia and a small shell  in about six the trochophore larvae depend on their internal yolk supply for they then develop into a fully shelled veliger larvae  also known as the late umbo stage  which have a hinged side and a velum  formed within 12  to 24  during this time  the shelled veliger larvae use their ciliated vela to capture food and the larvae remain planktonic for about 2  to 3  weeks  depending on food and temperature conditions  and towards the end of this period  they develop into pediveliger larvae  also known as eyed larvae  which have an umbo  an eyespot  and a during this time  the pediveliger larvae  settle to the bottom of the water column where they seek a hard ideally  the pediveliger larvae try to locate an adult oyster shell to which they attach  but other hard surfaces will suffice  lastly   after careful selection of the proper attachment site  in or during relatively still water  the pediveliger larvae cement themselves to a firm clean surface and metamorphose to the adult form  these newly attached oysters are known as upon being stimulated to settle  a larva cements its left valve to the substrate and metamorphoses into an oyster spat by discarding its velum  reabsorbing its foot  and enlarging its during the first year of life  c  virginica oysters are protandric  most spat are male  but once they reach sexual maturity  within four months in southern waters  some males change to females after the first or second then  some females can even change back to males prodissoconch  the shell of the free-swimming  veliger larval stage of c  virginica  is composed of aragonite  as opposed to the calcite composition of a postlarval adult oyster the epithelium of the oyster s mantle secretes both the prodissoconch and the postlarval shells  but at different tests were conducted to try to determine why larval and adult shells have different compositions  at the biological laboratory of the u s  bureau of commercial fisheries in milford  connecticut  larvae from the eastern oyster were reared in breeding tanks and were then collected  washed with distilled water  and dried as they the sample included a variety of larval stages  starting with the straight-hinge  veliger larva with its shell  the protostracum  to the last stage of the umbo larva with its shell  the prodissoconch  both of these larval stages have very thin  hyaline  and translucent the study showed the specific gravity of aragonite is 2.95  and calcite is 2.72,  so as far as weight is concerned  no advantage results for a larval oyster to have a shell made of one composition over the then  oyster larval shells were compared not with adult shells  but instead with other bivalve larval all  or almost all  bivalves have aragonitic larval shells because the majority of them have aragonitic adult shells  and c  virginica oyster larvae are assumed to have an aragonitic shell simply to conform to the general pattern in the no adaptive need is seen for free-swimming  larvae to have shells of a composition other than aragonite  they have that composition because their ancestors adaptations for a thicker shell are required for defense against predators because the oysters are permanently immobilized and therefore live in different environments than those of the free-swimming  columbus and the rise of industrial oyster operations  oysters abounded in the bay  oysters first arrived in the chesapeake 5,000  years ago  and shortly after  local indians began eating them  archaeologists found evidence the local native americans returned to the same place to collect oysters for 3,000  years  john smith  on a voyage up the chesapeake  stated oysters   lay as thick as in fact  the word chesapeake derives from an algonquian word meaning  great shellfish because of the abundance of oysters filtering the waters of the chesapeake  the water was much clearer than it is now  visibility would sometimes reach 20  feet  when the english began settling the area  they evidently had a localized impact of the oyster population  one archaeological site measured oyster sizes near maryland s old capital st  mary s city from 1640  to 1710.  in 1640,  when the city was still small  oysters measured 80  mm  and in the city s maximum population in 1690,  they measured to 40  mm  when the capital moved to annapolis  the population moved with it  and by 1710,  the oysters were back up to 80  however  the effect of local overharvesting would remain local until after the civil war  when a combination of new technologies led to the removal of nearly all the bay oysters during the industrial revolution  several new technologies were introduced to the chesapeake bay area  which allowed for more intensive oyster harvesting  first was the invention of canning  this allowed oysters to be preserved much longer  and created demand for oysters across the world  secondly  the invention of the dredge enabled oyster harvesters to reach untouched depths of the chesapeake  and finally  the proliferation of steam-powered  ships and railroads made transportation more reliable  enabling merchants to sell oysters far and wide  estimates for the harvest in 1839  give a figure of 700,000  bushels  after the civil war  dredges were legalized  and harvesting exploded to 5  million bushels that year  by 1875,  17  million bushels were taken from the bay  the harvesting would reach its peak in the 1880s,  with 20  million bushels being harvested from the bay each not only were they being taken for food  but also oyster reefs  where oysters had built hills of their dead shells over thousands of generations  were being dredged out  surplus oyster shells had many uses then  they were ground into mortar  used as filler in roads  and used as a source of lime in agricultural fertilizer  by the 1920s,  harvests would be down to just 3–5  million bushels per year because of overharvesting overharvesting would eventually deplete the remaining oyster population in the bay to just 1%  of its historical level  where it stands today  oyster harvests began to decline in the 1890s.  they were being taken much faster than they could reproduce  also  many of the shells and reefs were being taken and not being replaced  oyster spat need a hard surface on which to attach  and these were vanishing because of the destruction of oyster reefs  by the 1920s,  harvests were down to 3–5  million bushels per stabilized for a time by returning oyster shells back to the bay  but in the 1950s,  the weakened oyster population had to deal with the diseases  dermo  and msx  these decimated the remaining oyster population  the parasites which carried the disease are alien to eastern waters  and they were thought to have been brought to the chesapeake by asian oysters  currently  oyster harvests average less than 200,000  bushels a year the eastern oyster used to be of great commercial value  due to the steep decline in the number of oysters in various traditionally harvested areas  primarily because of overfishing and the annual catch has declined significantly  in maryland  the 2006–2007  catch was 165,059  bushels  about 7600  m³  of other regions of the east coast of the united states have successful oyster farms  including most notably cotuit and wellfleet  massachusetts  on cape cod harvestable size of a c  virginica oyster is 75  mm  which can take from 12  to 36  months  depending on temperature  salinity of the water  and food salinity is a very important climatological variable that affects spatfall  oysters do best where salinities range from 10  to 30  ppt  the range of 15  to 18  ppt is considered typically  when salinity levels are less than 6  ppt  larvae will not settle and metamorphose into in 2010,  665  miles of coastline were affected by the deepwater horizon oil to keep the oil at bay and to spare the oystermen  the authorities of louisiana made an unprecedented decision to maximize the fresh water flow through the region s canals to three times usual at the mouth of the canals  salinity fell to almost zero  which was probably why most of the oysters sujata gupta ventured into the marshlands and gulf of mexico with brad robin  a man from a line of generations of oystermen in southeastern louisiana  robin and his crew threw a net over the side to haul in a there were dozens of palm-sized  oysters  but 75%  of them were  boxes  or empty however  as they traveled further towards the gulf of mexico  where the water was less salinity-stressed  by the flush  only 20%  of the haul came back as boxes  a promising sign the oysters are trying to come gupta reported   now since there are so many empty shells scattered on the sea floor  the larvae have more to latch onto  improving their however  salinity levels are not the only concern  eastern oysters are filter feeders  so they are greatly affected by their surroundings since they are sessile organisms  this means if the water around them was contaminated with oil and the dispersant used to get rid of the oil  then these chemicals were collected by the oysters as they filtered the this is cause for great concern that the oysters are being killed by the toxins in the dispersant  as an added dilemma is oysters are in their weakest state after spawning season  which may have caused some of them to close their shells  resulting in death by suffocation within just a few days due to warm temperatures in the gulf if the shells remain the toxins in the oil and dispersants can also kill the to highlight the recovery of the state s oyster industry  the shell of c  virginica cut into cabochons was made louisiana s official state gem in  perkinsus marinus  is a marine disease of oysters  caused by a protozoan parasite  it is a prevalent pathogen of oysters  causing massive mortality in oyster populations  and poses a significant economic threat to the oyster industry multinucleated sphere x  msx   haplosporidium nelsoni   another protozoan  was first described along the mid-atlantic  coast in mortalities can reach 90%  to 95%  of the oyster population within 2  to 3  years of being msx slows the feeding rates of infected oysters  leading to a reduction in the amount of stored carbohydrates  which in turn inhibits normal gametogenesis during spawning  resulting in reduced fecundity
