 exoplanet -  wikipediaan exoplanet  uk   ˈɛk soʊˌplæn ɪt   us  or extrasolar planet is a planet outside of our solar system that orbits a star  the first evidence of an exoplanet was noted as early as 1917,  but was not recognized as however  the first scientific detection of an exoplanet was in 1988.  shortly afterwards  the first confirmed detection was in 1992.  as of 1  november 2017,  there are 3,693  planets in 2,768  systems  with 620  systems having more than one  since 2004)  has discovered about a hundred exoplanets while the kepler space telescope  since 2009)  has found more than two thousand  kepler has also detected a few candidate of which about 11%  may be false in several cases  multiple planets have been observed around a about 1  in 5  sun-like  have an planet in the habitable assuming there are 200  billion stars in the milky one can hypothesize that there are 11  billion potentially habitable earth-sized  planets in the milky way  rising to 40  billion if planets orbiting the numerous red dwarfs are least massive planet known is draugr  also known as psr b1257+12  a or psr b1257+12  b   which is about twice the mass of the moon  the most massive planet listed on the nasa exoplanet archive is denis-p  j082303.1-491201  about 29  times the mass of jupiter  although according to some definitions of a planet  it is too massive to be a planet and may be a brown dwarf instead  there are planets that are so near to their star that they take only a few hours to orbit and there are others so far away that they take thousands of years to orbit  some are so far out that it is difficult to tell whether they are gravitationally bound to the star  almost all of the planets detected so far are within the milky way  but there have also been a few possible detections of extragalactic planets  the nearest exoplanet is proxima centauri b  located 4.2  light-years  (1.3  parsecs  from earth and orbiting proxima centauri  the closest star to the discovery of exoplanets has intensified interest in the search for extraterrestrial life  there is special interest in planets that orbit in a star s habitable zone  where it is possible for liquid water  a prerequisite for life on earth  to exist on the surface  the study of planetary habitability also considers a wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting exoplanets  there are also rogue planets  which do not orbit any star and which tend to be considered separately  especially if they are gas giants  in which case they are often counted  like wise 0855−0714,  as sub-brown  the rogue planets in the milky way possibly number in the billions  or convention for designating exoplanets is an extension of the system used for designating multiple-star  systems as adopted by the international astronomical union  iau   for exoplanets orbiting a single star  the designation is normally formed by taking the name or  more commonly  designation of its parent star and adding a lower case the first planet discovered in a system is given the designation  b   the parent star is considered to be  a   and later planets are given subsequent letters  if several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time  the closest one to the star gets the next letter  followed by the other planets in order of orbital size  a provisional iau-sanctioned  standard exists to accommodate the designation of circumbinary planets  a limited number of exoplanets have iau-sanctioned  proper names  other naming systems exist for centuries scientists  philosophers  and science fiction writers suspected that extrasolar planets but there was no way of detecting them or of knowing their frequency or how similar they might be to the planets of the solar system  various detection claims made in the nineteenth century were rejected by astronomers  the first evidence of an exoplanet was noted as early as 1917,  but was not recognized as however  the first scientific detection of an exoplanet began in 1988.  shortly afterwards  the first confirmed detection came in 1992,  with the discovery of several terrestrial-mass  planets orbiting the pulsar psr the first confirmation of an exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence  star was made in 1995,  when a giant planet was found in a four-day  orbit around the nearby star 51  pegasi  some exoplanets have been imaged directly by telescopes  but the vast majority have been detected through indirect methods  such as the transit method and the radial-velocity  method in the sixteenth century the italian philosopher giordano bruno  an early supporter of the copernican theory that earth and other planets orbit the sun  heliocentrism   put forward the view that the fixed stars are similar to the sun and are likewise accompanied by planets in the eighteenth century the same possibility was mentioned by isaac newton in the  general scholium  that concludes his principia  making a comparison to the sun s planets  he wrote  and if the fixed stars are the centres of similar systems  they will all be constructed according to a similar design and subject to the dominion of 1952,  more than 40  years before the first hot jupiter was discovered  otto struve wrote that there is no compelling reason why planets could not be much closer to their parent star than is the case in the solar system  and proposed that doppler spectroscopy and the transit method could detect super-jupiters  in short of exoplanet detections have been made since the nineteenth century  some of the earliest involve the binary star 70  ophiuchi  in 1855  william stephen jacob at the east india company s madras observatory reported that orbital anomalies made it  highly probable  that there was a  planetary body  in this in the 1890s,  thomas j  j  see of the university of chicago and the united states naval observatory stated that the orbital anomalies proved the existence of a dark body in the 70  ophiuchi system with a 36-year  period around one of the however  forest ray moulton published a paper proving that a three-body  system with those orbital parameters would be highly during the 1950s  and 1960s,  peter van de kamp of swarthmore college made another prominent series of detection claims  this time for planets orbiting barnard s astronomers now generally regard all the early reports of detection as 1991  andrew lyne  m  bailes and s  l  shemar claimed to have discovered a pulsar planet in orbit around psr 1829-10,  using pulsar timing the claim briefly received intense attention  but lyne and his team soon retracted of 1  november 2017,  a total of 3,693  confirmed exoplanets are listed in the extrasolar planets encyclopaedia  including a few that were confirmations of controversial claims from the late the first published discovery to receive subsequent confirmation was made in 1988  by the canadian astronomers bruce campbell  g  a  h  walker  and stephenson yang of the university of victoria and the university of british although they were cautious about claiming a planetary detection  their radial-velocity  observations suggested that a planet orbits the star gamma cephei  partly because the observations were at the very limits of instrumental capabilities at the time  astronomers remained skeptical for several years about this and other similar observations  it was thought some of the apparent planets might instead have been brown dwarfs  objects intermediate in mass between planets and stars  in 1990  additional observations were published that supported the existence of the planet orbiting gamma but subsequent work in 1992  again raised serious finally  in 2003,  improved techniques allowed the planet s existence to be 9  january 1992,  radio astronomers aleksander wolszczan and dale frail announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsar psr this discovery was confirmed  and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets  follow-up  observations solidified these results  and confirmation of a third planet in 1994  revived the topic in the popular these pulsar planets are thought to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar  in a second round of planet formation  or else to be the remaining rocky cores of gas giants that somehow survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits on 6  october 1995,  michel mayor and didier queloz of the university of geneva announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence  star  namely the nearby g-type  star 51  this discovery  made at the observatoire de haute-provence,  ushered in the modern era of exoplanetary discovery  technological advances  most notably in high-resolution  spectroscopy  led to the rapid detection of many new exoplanets  astronomers could detect exoplanets indirectly by measuring their gravitational influence on the motion of their host stars  more extrasolar planets were later detected by observing the variation in a star s apparent luminosity as an orbiting planet passed in front of it initially  most known exoplanets were massive planets that orbited very close to their parent stars  astronomers were surprised by these  hot jupiters   because theories of planetary formation had indicated that giant planets should only form at large distances from stars  but eventually more planets of other sorts were found  and it is now clear that hot jupiters make up the minority of exoplanets  in 1999,  upsilon andromedae became the first main-sequence  star known to have multiple kepler-16  contains the first discovered planet that orbits around a binary main-sequence  star 26  february 2014,  nasa announced the discovery of 715  newly verified exoplanets around 305  stars by the kepler space telescope  these exoplanets were checked using a statistical technique called  verification by prior to these results  most confirmed planets were gas giants comparable in size to jupiter or larger as they are more easily detected  but the kepler planets are mostly between the size of neptune and the size of 23  july 2015,  nasa announced kepler-452b,  a near-earth-size  planet orbiting the habitable zone of a g2-type  of june 2017,  nasa s kepler mission had identified more than 5,000  planetary several of them being nearly earth-sized  and located in the habitable zone  some around sun-like  first exoplanet was detected on 6  october 1995,  and was named 51  pegasi when an extrasolar planet is observed to transit its parent star  astronomers are able to assess some physical properties of the planet from an interstellar distance  including planetary mass and size  which in turn provide fundamental constraints on models of their physical furthermore  such events afford the opportunity to study the dynamics and chemistry of its surveys and individual characterization are the keys to addressing the fundamental questions in as of august 2016,  varying techniques have been used to discover 3,502  documenting the properties of a large sample exoplanets at various ages  orbiting their parent stars of various types  will contribute to increased understanding —or better models— of planetary formation  accretion   geological evolution  orbit and their potential characterizing the atmospheres of extrasolar planets is the new frontier in exoplanetary 97%  of all the confirmed exoplanets have been discovered by indirect techniques of detection  mainly by radial velocity measurements and transit monitoring the following methods have proved successful for discovering a new planet or confirming an already discovered form within a few tens of millions of years of their star and there are stars that are forming today and other stars that are ten billion years old  studying exoplanets allows the observation of planets at different stages of their evolution  whereas the planets of the solar system can be observed only as they are today  when planets form  they have hydrogen envelopes that cool and contract over time and  depending on the mass of the planet  some or all of the hydrogen is eventually lost to space  this means that even terrestrial planets can start off with large an example is kepler-51b  which has only about twice the mass of earth but is almost the size of saturn which is a hundred times the mass of earth  kepler-51b  is quite young at a few hundred million years is at least one planet on average per about 1  in 5  sun-like  have an planet in the habitable known exoplanets orbit stars roughly similar to the sun  i e  main-sequence  stars of spectral categories f  g  or k  lower-mass  stars  red dwarfs  of spectral category m  are less likely to have planets massive enough to be detected by the radial-velocity  despite this  several tens of planets around red dwarfs have been discovered by the kepler spacecraft  which uses the transit method to detect smaller planets stars with a higher metallicity than the sun are more likely to have planets  especially giant planets  than stars with lower planets orbit one member of a binary star and several circumbinary planets have been discovered which orbit around both members of binary star  a few planets in triple star systems are and one in the quadruple system kepler-64.in  2013  the color of an exoplanet was determined for the first time  the best-fit  albedo measurements of hd 189733b  suggest that it is deep dark gj 504  b would have a magenta andromedae b  if seen up close  would appear reddish in apparent brightness  apparent magnitude  of a planet depends on how far away the observer is  how reflective the planet is  albedo   and how much light the planet receives from its star  which depends on how far the planet is from the star and how bright the star is  so  a planet with a low albedo that is close to its star can appear brighter than a planet with high albedo that is far from the darkest known planet in terms of geometric albedo is tres-2b,  a hot jupiter that reflects less than 1%  of the light from its star  making it less reflective than coal or black acrylic paint  hot jupiters are expected to be quite dark due to sodium and potassium in their atmospheres but it is not known why tres-2b  is so dark—it could be due to an unknown gas giants  geometric albedo generally decreases with increasing metallicity or atmospheric temperature unless there are clouds to modify this effect  increased cloud-column  depth increases the albedo at optical wavelengths  but decreases it at some infrared wavelengths  optical albedo increases with age  because older planets have higher cloud-column  depths  optical albedo decreases with increasing mass  because higher-mass  giant planets have higher surface gravities  which produces lower cloud-column  depths  also  elliptical orbits can cause major fluctuations in atmospheric composition  which can have a significant is more thermal emission than reflection at some near-infrared  wavelengths for massive and or young gas giants  so  although optical brightness is fully phase-dependent,  this is not always the case in the near of gas giants reduce over time and with distance from their star  lowering the temperature increases optical albedo even without clouds  at a sufficiently low temperature  water clouds form  which further increase optical albedo  at even lower temperatures ammonia clouds form  resulting in the highest albedos at most optical and near-infrared  2014,  a magnetic field around hd 209458  b was inferred from the way hydrogen was evaporating from the planet  it is the first  indirect  detection of a magnetic field on an exoplanet  the magnetic field is estimated to be about one tenth as strong as between a close-in  planet s magnetic field and a star can produce spots on the star in a similar way to how the galilean moons produce aurorae on auroral radio emissions could be detected with radio telescopes such as the radio emissions could enable determination of the rotation rate of a planet which is difficult to detect magnetic field results from its flowing liquid metallic core  but in massive super-earths  with high pressure  different compounds may form which do not match those created under terrestrial conditions  compounds may form with greater viscosities and high melting temperatures which could prevent the interiors from separating into different layers and so result in undifferentiated coreless mantles  forms of magnesium oxide such as mgsi3o12  could be a liquid metal at the pressures and temperatures found in super-earths  and could generate a magnetic field in the mantles of jupiters have been observed to have a larger radius than expected  this could be caused by the interaction between the stellar wind and the planet s magnetosphere creating an electric current through the planet that heats it up causing it to expand  the more magnetically active a star is the greater the stellar wind and the larger the electric current leading to more heating and expansion of the planet  this theory matches the observation that stellar activity is correlated with inflated planetary 2007  two independent teams of researchers came to opposing conclusions about the likelihood of plate tectonics on larger with one team saying that plate tectonics would be episodic or and the other team saying that plate tectonics is very likely on super-earths  even if the planet is super-earths  have more than 80  times as much water as earth then they become ocean planets with all land completely submerged  however  if there is less water than this limit  then the deep water cycle will move enough water between the oceans and mantle to allow continents to surface temperature variations on 55  cancri e have been attributed to possible volcanic activity releasing large clouds of dust which blanket the planet and block thermal star 1swasp  j140747.93-394542.6  is orbited by an object that is circled by a ring system much larger than saturn s rings  however  the mass of the object is not known  it could be a brown dwarf or low-mass  star instead of a brightness of optical images of fomalhaut b could be due to starlight reflecting off a circumplanetary ring system with a radius between 20  and 40  times that of jupiter s radius  about the size of the orbits of the galilean rings of the solar system s gas giants are aligned with their planet s equator  however  for exoplanets that orbit close to their star  tidal forces from the star would lead to the outermost rings of a planet being aligned with the planet s orbital plane around the star  a planet s innermost rings would still be aligned with the planet s equator so that if the planet has a tilted rotational axis  then the different alignments between the inner and outer rings would create a warped ring december 2013  a candidate exomoon of a rogue planet was no exomoons have been confirmed so far atmospheres have been detected around several exoplanets  the first to be observed was hd 209458  b in 12557548  b is a small rocky planet  very close to its star  that is evaporating and leaving a trailing tail of cloud and dust like a the dust could be ash erupting from volcanos and escaping due to the small planet s low surface-gravity,  or it could be from metals that are vaporized by the high temperatures of being so close to the star with the metal vapor then condensing into june 2015,  scientists reported that the atmosphere of gj 436  b was evaporating  resulting in a giant cloud around the planet and  due to radiation from the host star  a long trailing tail 14×10^6  km (9×10^6  mi  may 2017,  glints of light from earth  seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away  were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the the technology used to determine this may be useful in studying the atmospheres of distant worlds  including those of exoplanets tidally locked planets in a 1:1  spin–orbit resonance would have their star always shining directly overhead on one spot which would be hot with the opposite hemisphere receiving no light and being freezing cold  such a planet could resemble an eyeball with the hotspot being the planets with an eccentric orbit could be locked in other resonances  3:2  and 5:2  resonances would result in a double-eyeball  pattern with hotspots in both eastern and western planets with both an eccentric orbit and a tilted axis of rotation would have more complicated insolation more planets are discovered  the field of exoplanetology continues to grow into a deeper study of extrasolar worlds  and will ultimately tackle the prospect of life on planets beyond the solar at cosmic distances  life can only be detected if it is developed at a planetary scale and strongly modified the planetary environment  in such a way that the modifications cannot be explained by classical physico-chemical  processes  out of equilibrium for example  molecular oxygen  o 2)  in the atmosphere of earth is a result of photosynthesis by living plants and many kinds of microorganisms  so it can be used as an indication of life on exoplanets  although small amounts of oxygen could also be produced by non-biological  furthermore  a potentially habitable planet must orbit a stable star at a distance within which planetary-mass  objects with sufficient atmospheric pressure can support liquid water at their 9  may 2013,  a congressional hearing by two united states house of representatives subcommittees discussed  exoplanet discoveries  have we found other earths    prompted by the discovery of exoplanet kepler-62f,  along with kepler-62e  and kepler-62c.  a related special issue of the journal science  published earlier  described the discovery of the
