 collapse of the atlantic northwest cod fishery -  wikipediain 1992  the canadian federal minister of fisheries and oceans  john crosbie  declared a moratorium on the northern cod fishery  which for the preceding 500  years had largely shaped the lives and communities of canada s eastern coast  fishing societies interplay with the resources which they depend on  fisheries transform the ecosystem  which pushes the fishery and society to in the summer of 1992,  when the northern cod biomass fell to 1%  of its earlier canada s federal government saw that this relationship had been pushed to the breaking point  and declared a moratorium  ending the region s 500-year  run with the northern cod observations on the reduced number and size of cod  and concerns of fishermen and amateur marine was offered  but generally ignored in favour of the uncertain science and harmful federal policies of canada s department of fisheries and oceans until the undeniable complete collapse of the fishery  according to any reasonable analysis  the collapse was first due to massive overfishing  second  the dependence for maintenance of the fishery itself on the nutrient cycle that was being disrupted by removal of megatons of biomass from a closed system resulted in the starvation of the residual academics have highlighted these following four contributing factors in the eventual collapse of the cod fishery a major factor that contributed to the depletion of the cod stocks off the shores of newfoundland included the introduction and proliferation of equipment and technology that increased the volume of landed fish  for centuries local fishermen used technology that limited the volume of their catch  the area they fished  and let them target specific species and ages of from the 1950s  onwards  as was common in all industries at the time  new technology was introduced that allowed fishermen to trawl a larger area  fish to a deeper depth and for a longer time  by the 1960s,  powerful trawlers equipped with radar  electronic navigation systems and sonar allowed crews to pursue fish with unparalleled success  and canadian catches peaked in the late 1970s  and early the new technologies adversely affected the northern cod population in two important ways  by increasing the area and depth that was fished  the cod were being depleted until the surviving fish could not replenish the stock lost each and secondly  the trawlers caught enormous amounts of non-commercial  fish  which were economically unimportant but very important ecologically  incidental catch undermines the whole ecosystem  depleting stocks of important predator and prey species  with the northern cod  significant amounts of capelin – an important prey species for the cod – were caught as bycatch  further undermining the survival of the remaining cod stock another factor important to consider in understanding the fishery s collapse is uncertainty in assessing the cod as a resource  management of a resource is an extremely complex task  with a multitude of interests  perspectives  and sources of information to take into account  when knowledge regarding the resource is limited  or clouded by imprecision  the task of managing it becomes even more difficult  the management of fisheries is associated with an especially high degree of uncertainty due to problems inherent in the nature of the resource  newfoundland s cod fisheries were no exception  an imperfect understanding of the ocean ecosystem  technical and environmental challenges associated with observation techniques  which led to incomplete data on the resource  the cod   and the naturally high levels of variability in the population due to dynamic environmental factors  such as ocean temperature  combined to make it arduous to discern the effects of unfortunately  this led to predictions about the cod stock that were mired in uncertainty  making it more difficult for the government to choose the appropriate course of action in addition to ecological considerations  decisions regarding the future of the fisheries were also influenced by social and economic factors  throughout atlantic canada  but especially in newfoundland  the cod fishery was a source of social and cultural for many families  it also represented their livelihood  most families were connected either directly or indirectly with the fishery as fishers  fish plant workers  fish sellers  fish transporters  or as employees in related additionally  many companies  both foreign and domestic  as well as individuals  had invested heavily in the boats  equipment and the infrastructure of the fishery  and therefore felt it was in their best interest to maintain an open-access  policy to the ocean and its resources  this alludes to the unfortunate paradox that often accompanies open-access  resources and is known by most as the tragedy of the commons  what is in the individual s best interest is not always in the best interest of a society at whole  in the case of newfoundland and the northern cod fishery this meant that from the perspective of the individual participating in the fishing industry  maximizing their catch was in their best interest  however when the government failed to intervene – due largely to the highly sensitive nature of the political discourse created by the expansive group of stakeholders – the ecosystem was brought past its threshold and collapsed  leaving everyone worse needed newfoundland s fishery fell under the management of the department of fisheries and oceans in 1949,  when newfoundland joined canada as a province  unfortunately  the department mismanaged the resource and allowed even today  should international fishing and exploitation of the residual resource resume in force  canada has no capacity at all to enforce or police any limits to the practices of foreign fishing activity  canada also has no policy plan  nor naval capacity to guard its own territorial rights and resources the number of fishing trawlers in the 1960s  increased  and inshore fishers complained to the this resulted in the government redefining the offshore fishery boundaries several times  and eventually extended its limits from 3  mi to 200  mi as part of its claim for an exclusive economic zone under the unclos  in 1976,  the government declared the right to manage the fisheries in an exclusive economic zone that extended to 200  mi offshore  the government wanted to reverse declining fish stocks by removing foreign fishing within the new inshore fishery with the absence of foreign fishing many canadian and u s fishing trawlers took their place and the number of cod kept diminishing past a point of local fishermen noticed the drastic decrease of cod and tried to inform local government officials  in 1986,  scientists did a review of calculations and data after which they determined  in order to conserve cod fishing the total allowable catch rate had to be cut in half  however  even with these new statistics brought to light no changes were made in regards to the allotted yearly catch of only a limited knowledge of cod biology  scientists predicted that the population of the species would rebound from its low point in 1975  and when canada extended its fishing boundaries in 1976,  fish mortality decreased this was not due to a rise in cod stocks  it was because foreign trawlers could no longer fish the waters  therefore  when fisheries and oceans set quotas  they overestimated the total stock  and increased the total allowable 1992,  john crosbie  the minister of fisheries and oceans at the time  set the quota for cod at 187  969  tonnes  even though only 129  033  tonnes had been caught the previous year  that same year  the government announced a moratorium on cod the government finally acted  it was too late  the 1992  moratorium was at first meant to last two years  hoping that the northern cod population would recover  and along with it the fishery  the damage done to newfoundland s coastal ecosystem proved irreversible  even after twenty years  the northern cod population has not and the cod fishery remains closed.35,000  fishers and fish plant workers lost their jobs due to the collapse of the cod fisheries  many people had to find new jobs or further their education to be able to find jobs  it was devastating for many communities and certainly impacted newfoundland in a profound way  local fisherman noticed the decrease of fish however  scientists reported needed   new technologies  such as trawlers  made this possible because more fish were being caught than ever before which was chalked up to the stock collapse of the northern cod fishery marked a profound change in the ecological  economic and socio-cultural  structure of atlantic canada  the moratorium in 1992  marked the largest industrial closure in canadian and it was expressed most acutely in newfoundland  whose continental shelf lay under the region most heavily fished  over 35,000  fishers and plant workers from over 400  coastal communities became in response to dire warnings of social and economic consequences  the federal government intervened  initially providing income assistance through the northern cod adjustment and recovery program  and later through the atlantic groundfish strategy  which included money specifically for the retraining of those workers displaced by the closing of the newfoundland has since experienced a dramatic environmental  industrial  economic  and social restructuring  including considerable but also increased economic diversification  an increased emphasis on education  and the emergence of a thriving invertebrates fishing industry  as the predatory groundfish population declined  snow crab and northern shrimp proliferated  providing the basis for a new industry that is roughly equivalent in economic value as the cod fishery it by the grand banks cod fishery collapse  the marine stewardship council was founded in 1997  to set global standards for sustainable fishing in november 2006,  fisheries and oceans canada released an article suggesting that the unexpectedly slow recovery of the cod stock is due to inadequate food cooling of the north atlantic  and a poor genetic stock due to the overfishing of larger during the summer of 2011,  a study was announced that showed east coast cod stocks around nova scotia showed promises of recovery  despite earlier thoughts of complete it was found that initial stages of recovery began around 2005,  though more time and studies were needed to study the long-term  stability of the stock increase  in addition  in 2010  a study by the northwest atlantic fisheries organization found that stocks in the grand banks near newfoundland and labrador had recovered by 69%  since 2007,  though that number only equated to 10%  of the original a letter to nature in 2011,  a team of canadian scientists reported that cod in the scotian shelf ecosystem off canada are showing signs of brian petrie  a member of the team  said  cod is about a third of the way to full recovery  and haddock is already back to historical biomass despite such positive reports  cod landings have continued to decline since 2009  according to fisheries and oceans canada statistics through this decline appeared to be continuing through 2015,  two reports on cod fishery recovery offered hopeful and cautionary a canadian scientist that in particular areas  cod are increasing in numbers  health  normalising in maturity and behaviour  and offers a promising estimate of increased biomass  however  past assessments of  cod stock  have been greatly overestimated by generalisation beyond areas measured  which was a great part of the incompetent policymaking  and mismanagement of the canadian department of fisheries and a us suggests that a failure to consider reduced resilience of cod population due to increased mortality in warming surface water of the gulf of maine has led to overfishing despite regulation  thus overestimates of stock biomass due to generalisation of local estimates  and ignorance of environmental factors in growth or recovery potential of a cod fishery will lead to mismanagement and further collapse of stocks  through further unsustainable quotas as in the past
