 oceanography -  wikipediaoceanography  compound of the greek words ὠκεανός meaning  ocean  and γράφω meaning  write    also known as oceanology  is the study of the physical and the biological aspects of the ocean  it is an earth science covering a wide range of topics  including ecosystem dynamics  ocean currents  waves  and geophysical fluid dynamics  plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor  and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries  these diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within  astronomy  biology  chemistry  climatology  geography  geology  hydrology  meteorology and physics  paleoceanography studies the history of the oceans in the geologic past humans first acquired knowledge of the waves and currents of the seas and oceans in pre-historic  times  observations on tides were recorded by aristotle and strabo  early exploration of the oceans was primarily for cartography and mainly limited to its surfaces and of the animals that fishermen brought up in nets  though depth soundings by lead line were taken although juan ponce de león in 1513  first identified the gulf stream  and the current was well-known  to mariners  benjamin franklin made the first scientific study of it and gave it its name  franklin measured water temperatures during several atlantic crossings and correctly explained the gulf stream s cause  franklin and timothy folger printed the first map of the gulf stream in on the currents of the pacific ocean was gathered by explorers of the late 18th  century  including james cook and louis antoine de bougainville  james rennell wrote the first scientific textbooks on oceanography  detailing the current flows of the atlantic and indian oceans  during a voyage around the cape of good hope in 1777,  he mapped  the banks and currents at the lagullas   he was also the first to understand the nature of the intermittent current near the isles of scilly   now known as rennell s james clark ross took the first modern sounding in deep sea in 1840,  and charles darwin published a paper on reefs and the formation of atolls as a result of the second voyage of hms beagle in 1831-6.  robert fitzroy published a four-volume  report of the beagle s three voyages  in 1841–1842  edward forbes undertook dredging in the aegean sea that founded marine ecology the first superintendent of the united states naval observatory (1842–1861),  matthew fontaine maury devoted his time to the study of marine meteorology  navigation  and charting prevailing winds and currents  his 1855  textbook physical geography of the sea was one of the first comprehensive oceanography studies  many nations sent oceanographic observations to maury at the naval observatory  where he and his colleagues evaluated the information and distributed the results all this  human knowledge of the oceans remained confined to the topmost few fathoms of the water and a small amount of the bottom  mainly in shallow areas  almost nothing was known of the ocean depths  the royal navy s efforts to chart all of the world s coastlines in the mid-19th  century reinforced the vague idea that most of the ocean was very deep  although little more was known  as exploration ignited both popular and scientific interest in the polar regions and africa  so too did the mysteries of the unexplored oceans the seminal event in the founding of the modern science of oceanography was the 1872-76  challenger expedition  as the first true oceanographic cruise  this expedition laid the groundwork for an entire academic and research in response to a recommendation from the royal society  the british government announced in 1871  an expedition to explore world s oceans and conduct appropriate scientific investigation  charles wyville thompson and sir john murray launched the challenger expedition  the challenger  leased from the royal navy  was modified for scientific work and equipped with separate laboratories for natural history and under the scientific supervision of thomson  challenger travelled nearly 70,000  nautical miles (130,000  km  surveying and exploring  on her journey circumnavigating the 492  deep sea soundings  133  bottom dredges  151  open water trawls and 263  serial water temperature observations were around 4,700  new species of marine life were discovered  the result was the report of the scientific results of the exploring voyage of h m s  challenger during the years 1873-76.  murray  who supervised the publication  described the report as  the greatest advance in the knowledge of our planet since the celebrated discoveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries   he went on to found the academic discipline of oceanography at the university of edinburgh  which remained the centre for oceanographic research well into the 20th  murray was the first to study marine trenches and in particular the mid-atlantic  ridge  and map the sedimentary deposits in the oceans  he tried to map out the world s ocean currents based on salinity and temperature observations  and was the first to correctly understand the nature of coral reef development in the late 19th  century  other western nations also sent out scientific expeditions  as did private individuals and institutions   the first purpose built oceanographic ship  the albatros  was built in 1882.  in 1893,  fridtjof nansen allowed his ship  fram  to be frozen in the arctic ice  this enabled him to obtain oceanographic  meteorological and astronomical data at a stationary spot over an extended period in 1881  the geographer john francon williams published a seminal book  geography of the between 1907  and 1911  otto krümmel published the handbuch der ozeanographie  which became influential in awakening public interest in the four-month  1910  north atlantic expedition headed by john murray and johan hjort was the most ambitious research oceanographic and marine zoological project ever mounted until then  and led to the classic 1912  book the depths of the ocean the first acoustic measurement of sea depth was made in 1914.  between 1925  and 1927  the  meteor  expedition gathered 70,000  ocean depth measurements using an echo sounder  surveying the mid-atlantic  ridge sverdrup  johnson and fleming published the oceans in which was a major landmark  the sea  in three volumes  covering physical oceanography  seawater and geology  edited by m n  hill was published in 1962,  while rhodes fairbridge s encyclopedia of oceanography was published in 1966.the  great global rift  running along the mid atlantic ridge  was discovered by maurice ewing and bruce heezen in 1953;  in 1954  a mountain range under the arctic ocean was found by the arctic institute of the ussr  the theory of seafloor spreading was developed in 1960  by harry hammond hess  the ocean drilling program started in 1966.  deep sea vents were discovered in 1977  by john corlis and robert ballard in the submersible dsv alvin in the 1950s,  auguste piccard invented the bathyscaphe and used the trieste to investigate the ocean s depths  the united states nuclear submarine nautilus made the first journey under the ice to the north pole in 1958.  in 1962  the flip  floating instrument platform   a 355-foot  spar buoy  was first deployed from the 1970s,  there has been much emphasis on the application of large scale computers to oceanography to allow numerical predictions of ocean conditions and as a part of overall environmental change prediction  an oceanographic buoy array was established in the pacific to allow prediction of el niño events.1990  saw the start of the world ocean circulation experiment  woce  which continued until 2002.  geosat seafloor mapping data became available in 1995.in  recent years studies advanced particular knowledge on ocean acidification  ocean heat content  ocean currents  the el niño phenomenon  mapping of methane hydrate deposits  the carbon cycle  coastal erosion  weathering and climate feedbacks in regards to climate change interactions study of the oceans is linked to understanding global climate changes  potential global warming and related biosphere concerns  the atmosphere and ocean are linked because of evaporation and precipitation as well as thermal flux  and solar insolation   wind stress is a major driver of ocean currents while the ocean is a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide  all these factors relate to the ocean s biogeochemical setup the study of oceanography is divided into these four branches ocean acidification describes the decrease in ocean ph that is caused by anthropogenic carbon dioxide (co2)  emissions into the seawater is slightly alkaline and had a preindustrial ph of about 8.2.  more recently  anthropogenic activities have steadily increased the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere  about 30–40%  of the added co2  is absorbed by the oceans  forming carbonic acid and lowering the ph  now below through ocean the ph is expected to reach 7.7  by the year important element for the skeletons of marine animals is calcium  but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure  so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below the carbonate compensation calcium carbonate becomes more soluble at lower ph  so ocean acidification is likely to affect marine organisms with calcareous shells  such as oysters  clams  sea urchins and and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface  affected planktonic organisms will include pteropods  coccolithophorids and foraminifera  all important in the food chain  in tropical regions  corals are likely to be severely affected as they become less able to build their calcium carbonate in turn adversely impacting other reef current rate of ocean chemistry change seems to be unprecedented in earth s geological history  making it unclear how well marine ecosystems will adapt to the shifting conditions of the near of particular concern is the manner in which the combination of acidification with the expected additional stressors of higher temperatures and lower oxygen levels will impact the the early ocean expeditions in oceanography  a major interest was the study of the ocean currents and temperature measurements  the tides  the coriolis effect  changes in direction and strength of wind  salinity and temperature are the main factors determining ocean currents  the thermohaline circulation  thc  thermo-  referring to temperature and -haline  referring to salt content connects 4  of 5  ocean basins and is primarily dependent on the density of sea water  ocean currents such as the gulf stream are wind-driven  surface currents oceanic heat content  ohc  refers to the heat stored in the ocean  the changes in the ocean heat play an important role in sea level rise  because of thermal expansion  ocean warming accounts for 90%  of the energy accumulation from global warming between 1971  and first international organization of oceanography was created in 1902  as the international council for the exploration of the sea  in 1903  the scripps institution of oceanography was founded  followed by woods hole oceanographic institution in 1930,  virginia institute of marine science in 1938,  and later the lamont-doherty  earth observatory at columbia university  and the school of oceanography at university of washington  in britain  the national oceanography centre  an institute of the natural environment research council  is the successor to the uk s institute of oceanographic sciences  in australia  csiro marine and atmospheric research  cmar   is a leading centre  in 1921  the international hydrographic bureau  ihb  was formed in monaco
