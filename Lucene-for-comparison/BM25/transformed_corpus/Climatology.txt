 climatology -  wikipediaatmospheric physics atmospheric dynamics  category weather  category  ·  portal climate  category  climate change  category climatology  from greek κλίμα  klima   place  zone   and -λογία,  -logia)  or climate science is the study of climate  scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of this modern field of study is regarded as a branch of the atmospheric sciences and a subfield of physical geography  which is one of the earth sciences  climatology now includes aspects of oceanography and biogeochemistry  basic knowledge of climate can be used within shorter term weather forecasting using analog techniques such as the el niño–southern oscillation  enso   the madden–julian oscillation  mjo   the north atlantic oscillation  nao   the northern annular mode  nam  which is also known as the arctic oscillation  ao   the northern pacific  np  index  the pacific decadal oscillation  pdo   and the interdecadal pacific oscillation  ipo   climate models are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system to projections of future climate  weather is known as the condition of the atmosphere over a period of time  while climate has to do with the atmospheric condition over an extended to indefinite period of scientist shen kuo (1031–1095)  inferred that climates naturally shifted over an enormous span of time  after observing petrified bamboos found underground near yanzhou  modern day yan an  shaanxi province   a dry-climate  area unsuitable for the growth of climate researchers include edmund halley  who published a map of the trade winds in 1686  after a voyage to the southern hemisphere  benjamin franklin (1706–1790)  first mapped the course of the gulf stream for use in sending mail from the united states to europe  francis galton (1822–1911)  invented the term helmut landsberg (1906–1985)  fostered the use of statistical analysis in climatology  which led to its evolution into a physical science climatology is approached in various ways such as paleoclimatology  which seeks to reconstruct past climates by examining records such as ice cores and tree rings  dendroclimatology   paleotempestology uses these same records to help determine hurricane frequency over millennia  the study of contemporary climates incorporates meteorological data accumulated over many years  such as records of rainfall  temperature and atmospheric composition  knowledge of the atmosphere and its dynamics is also embodied in models  either statistical or mathematical  which help by integrating different observations and testing how they fit together  modeling is used for understanding past  present and potential future climates  historical climatology is the study of climate as related to human history and thus focuses only on the last few thousand years climate research is made difficult by the large scale  long time periods  and complex processes which govern climate  climate is governed by physical laws which can be expressed as differential equations  these equations are coupled and nonlinear  so that approximate solutions are obtained by using numerical methods to create global climate models  climate is sometimes modeled as a stochastic process but this is generally accepted as an approximation to processes that are otherwise too complicated to analyze scientists use climate indices based on several climate patterns  known as modes of variability  in their attempt to characterize and understand the various climate mechanisms that culminate in our daily weather  much in the way the dow jones industrial average  which is based on the stock prices of 30  companies  is used to represent the fluctuations in the stock market as a whole  climate indices are used to represent the essential elements of climate  climate indices are generally devised with the twin objectives of simplicity and completeness  and each index typically represents the status and timing of the climate factor it represents  by their very nature  indices are simple  and combine many details into a generalized  overall description of the atmosphere or ocean which can be used to characterize the factors which impact the global climate system el niño–southern oscillation  enso  is a global coupled ocean-atmosphere  phenomenon  the pacific ocean signatures  el niño and la niña are important temperature fluctuations in surface waters of the tropical eastern pacific ocean  the name el niño  from the spanish for  the little boy   refers to the christ child  because the phenomenon is usually noticed around christmas time in the pacific ocean off the west coast of south la niña means  the little their effect on climate in the subtropics and the tropics are profound  the atmospheric signature  the southern oscillation  so  reflects the monthly or seasonal fluctuations in the air pressure difference between tahiti and darwin  the most recent occurrence of el niño started in september and lasted until early is a set of interacting parts of a single global system of coupled ocean-atmosphere  climate fluctuations that come about as a consequence of oceanic and atmospheric circulation  enso is the most prominent known source of inter-annual  variability in weather and climate around the world  the cycle occurs every two to seven years  with el niño lasting nine months to two years within the longer term though not all areas globally are affected  enso has signatures in the pacific  atlantic and indian oceans in the pacific  during major warm events  el niño warming extends over much of the tropical pacific and becomes clearly linked to the so intensity  while enso events are basically in phase between the pacific and indian oceans  enso events in the atlantic ocean lag behind those in the pacific by 12–18  months  many of the countries most affected by enso events are developing countries within tropical sections of continents with economies that are largely dependent upon their agricultural and fishery sectors as a major source of food supply  employment  and foreign new capabilities to predict the onset of enso events in the three oceans can have global socio-economic  impacts  while enso is a global and natural part of the earth s climate  whether its intensity or frequency may change as a result of global warming is an important concern  low-frequency  variability has been evidenced  the quasi-decadal  oscillation  qdo   inter-decadal   id  modulation of enso  from pdo or ipo  might exist  this could explain the so-called  protracted enso of the early 1990s.the  madden–julian oscillation  mjo  is an equatorial traveling pattern of anomalous rainfall that is planetary in scale  it is characterized by an eastward progression of large regions of both enhanced and suppressed tropical rainfall  observed mainly over the indian and pacific oceans  the anomalous rainfall is usually first evident over the western indian ocean  and remains evident as it propagates over the very warm ocean waters of the western and central tropical pacific  this pattern of tropical rainfall then generally becomes very nondescript as it moves over the cooler ocean waters of the eastern pacific but reappears over the tropical atlantic and indian oceans  the wet phase of enhanced convection and precipitation is followed by a dry phase where convection is suppressed  each cycle lasts approximately 30–60  days  the mjo is also known as the 30-  to 60-day  oscillation  30-  to 60-day  wave  or the intraseasonal oscillation indices of the nao are based on the difference of normalized sea level pressure  slp  between ponta delgada  azores and stykkisholmur reykjavik  iceland  the slp anomalies at each station were normalized by division of each seasonal mean pressure by the long-term  mean (1865–1984)  standard deviation  normalization is done to avoid the series of being dominated by the greater variability of the northern of the two stations  positive values of the index indicate stronger-than-average  westerlies over the middle nam  or ao  is defined as the first eof of northern hemisphere winter slp data from the tropics and subtropics  it explains 23%  of the average winter  december–march  variance  and it is dominated by the nao structure in the atlantic  although there are some subtle differences from the regional pattern over the atlantic and arctic  the main difference is larger amplitude anomalies over the north pacific of the same sign as those over the atlantic  this feature gives the nam a more annular  or zonally symmetric  np index is the area-weighted  sea level pressure over the region 30n–65n,  pdo is a pattern of pacific climate variability that shifts phases on at least inter-decadal  time scale  usually about 20  to 30  years  the pdo is detected as warm or cool surface waters in the pacific ocean  north of 20°  n  during a  warm   or  positive   phase  the west pacific becomes cool and part of the eastern ocean warms  during a  cool  or  negative  phase  the opposite pattern occurs  the mechanism by which the pattern lasts over several years has not been identified  one suggestion is that a thin layer of warm water during summer may shield deeper cold waters  a pdo signal has been reconstructed to 1661  through tree-ring  chronologies in the baja california area the interdecadal pacific oscillation  ipo or id  display similar sea surface temperature  sst  and sea level pressure patterns to the pdo  with a cycle of 15–30  years  but affects both the north and south pacific  in the tropical pacific  maximum sst anomalies are found away from the equator  this is quite different from the quasi-decadal  oscillation  qdo  with a period of 8–12  years and maximum sst anomalies straddling the equator  thus resembling enso climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere  oceans  land surface  and ice  they are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system to projections of future climate  all climate models balance  or very nearly balance  incoming energy as short wave  including visible  electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave  infrared  electromagnetic radiation from the earth  any unbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth the most talked-about  models of recent years have been those relating temperature to emissions of carbon dioxide  see greenhouse gas   these models predict an upward trend in the surface temperature record  as well as a more rapid increase in temperature at higher latitudes models can range from relatively simple to quite complex in contrast to meteorology  which focuses on short term weather systems lasting up to a few weeks  climatology studies the frequency and trends of those systems  it studies the periodicity of weather events over years to millennia  as well as changes in long-term  average weather patterns  in relation to atmospheric conditions  climatologists study both the nature of climates – local  regional or global – and the natural or human-induced  factors that cause climates to change  climatology considers the past and can help predict future climate change phenomena of climatological interest include the atmospheric boundary layer  circulation patterns  heat transfer  radiative  convective and latent   interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans and land surface  particularly vegetation  land use and topography   and the chemical and physical composition of the atmosphere a more complicated way of making a forecast  the analog technique requires remembering a previous weather event which is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event  what makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition  which remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans with knowledge of how satellite imagery relates to precipitation rates over as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future  a variation on this theme is used in medium range forecasting  which is known as teleconnections  when you use systems in other locations to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding one method of using teleconnections are by using climate indices such as enso-related
