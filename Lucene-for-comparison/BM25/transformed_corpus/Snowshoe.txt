 snowshoe -  wikipediaa snowshoe is footwear for walking over snow  snowshoes work by distributing the weight of the person over a larger area so that the person s foot does not sink completely into the snow  a quality called  flotation   snowshoeing is a form of hiking traditional snowshoes have a hardwood frame with rawhide lacings  some modern snowshoes are similar  but most are made of materials such as lightweight metal  plastic  and synthetic fabric  in addition to distributing the weight  snowshoes are generally raised at the toe for maneuverability  they must not accumulate snow  hence the latticework  and require bindings to attach them to the feet in the past  snowshoes were essential tools for fur traders  trappers and anyone whose life or living depended on the ability to get around in areas of deep and frequent snowfall  and they remain necessary equipment for forest rangers and others who must be able to get around areas inaccessible to motorized vehicles when the snow is deep  however  snowshoes are mainly used today for recreation  primarily by hikers and runners who like to continue their hobby in wintertime  snowshoeing is easy to learn and in appropriate conditions is a relatively safe and inexpensive recreational activity  however  snowshoeing in icy  steep terrain can be more dangerous before people built snowshoes  nature provided examples  several animals  most notably the snowshoe hare  had evolved over the years with oversized feet enabling them to move more quickly through deep snow the origin and age of snowshoes are not precisely known  although historians believe they were invented from 4,000  to 6,000  years ago  probably starting in central british archaeologist jacqui wood hypothesized that the equipment interpreted to be the frame of a backpack of the chalcolithic mummy ötzi was actually part of a strabo wrote that the inhabitants of the caucasus used to attach flat surfaces of leather under their feet and that its inhabitants used round wooden surfaces  something akin to blocks  instead  however  the  traditional  webbed snowshoe as we know it today had direct origins to north american indigenous people  e g   the huron  cree  and so samuel de champlain wrote  referencing the huron and algonquin first nations  in his travel memoirs  v iii  pg  164),   winter  when there is much snow  they  the indians  make a kind of snowshoe that are two to three times larger than those in france  that they tie to their feet  and thus go on the snow  without sinking into it  otherwise they would not be able to hunt or go from one location to the other  two groups of snowshoe pioneers diverged early on  setting patterns that can still be seen today  one group abandoned the snowshoe as it migrated north to what is now scandinavia  eventually turning the design into the forerunners of the nordic ski  the other went northeast  eventually crossing the bering strait into north needed in 2016,  italian scientists reported  the oldest snowshoe in the world  discovered in the dolomites and dated to between 3800  and 3700  indigenous people of north america developed the most advanced and diverse snowshoes prior to the 20th  century  nearly every north american aboriginal culture developed its own particular shape of shoe  the simplest and most primitive being those of the far north  the inuit have two styles  one being triangular in shape and about 18  inches (46  cm  in length  and the other almost circular  both reflecting the need for high flotation in deep  loose and powdery snow  however  contrary to popular perception  the inuit did not use their snowshoes much since they did most of their foot travel in winter over sea ice or on the tundra  where snow does not pile up deeply southward the shoe becomes gradually narrower and longer  the largest being the hunting snow-shoe  of the cree  which is nearly 6  ft (1.8  m  long and turned up at the toe  even smaller models  developed most notably by the iroquois  are narrower and shorter  reflecting the need for maneuverability in forested areas the plains indians wore snowshoes on their winter season bison hunts before horses were introduced  despite their great diversity in form  snowshoes were  in fact  one of the few cultural elements common to all tribes that lived where the winters were snowy  in particular  the northern regions snowshoes were slowly adopted by europeans in what became canada and the united states  with the french voyageurs and coureur des bois well in advance of british settlers  according to the encyclopædia britannica  french voyageurs were primarily 18th  and 19th  century french canadian fur traders who explored the frontier waterways by canoe  the europeans adopted the use of snowshoes through the french and indian wars  superior french snowshoeing skill almost turned the french and indian war  a conflict that saw two engagements named the battle on snowshoes  to their favor however  the british were quick learners  the oxford english dictionary reports the term being used by the english as early as 1674.  sixteen years later  after a french-indian  raiding party attacked a british settlement near what is today schenectady  new york  the british took to their own snowshoes and pursued the attackers for almost 50  miles (80  km   ultimately recovering both people and goods taken by their attackers the  teardrop  snowshoes worn by lumberjacks are about 40  inches (1.0  m  long and broad in proportion  while the tracker s shoe is over 5  feet (1.5  m  long and very narrow  this form  the stereotypical snowshoe  resembles a tennis racquet  and indeed the french term is raquette de neige this form was copied by the canadian snowshoe clubs of the late 18th  century  founded for military training purposes  they became the earliest recreational users of snowshoes the snowshoe clubs such as the montreal snow shoe club (1840)  shortened the teardrop to about 40  inches (100  cm  long and 15  to 18  inches (380  to 460  mm  broad  slightly turned up at the toe and terminating in a kind of tail behind  this is made very light for racing purposes  but much stouter for touring or hunting  the tail keeps the shoe straight while walking another variant  the  bearpaw   ends in a curved heel instead of a tail  while many early enthusiasts found this more difficult to learn on  as they were thicker in the middle and rather cumbersome  they did have the advantage of being easier to pack and nimbler in tight spaces  two forms of traditional bearpaw snowshoes developed  an eastern version used by  spruce gummers  consisting of an oval frame with wooden cross braces  and a western version with a rounded triangular frame and no wooden bracing traditional snowshoes are made of a single strip of some tough wood  usually white ash  curved round and fastened together at the ends and supported in the middle by a light cross-bar.  the space within the frame is filled with a close webbing of dressed caribou or neat's-hide  strips  leaving a small opening just behind the cross-bar  for the toe of the moccasined foot  they are fastened to the moccasin by leather thongs  sometimes by buckles  such shoes are still made and sold by native peoples outside of indigenous populations and some competitions such as arctic winter games  very few of the old-fashioned  snowshoes are actually used by enthusiasts anymore  although some value them for the artisanship involved in their construction  they are sometimes seen as decorations  mounted on walls or on mantels in ski lodges even though many enthusiasts prefer aluminum snowshoes  there is still a large group of snowshoe enthusiasts who prefer wooden snowshoes  wooden frames do not freeze as readily  many enthusiasts also prefer wood snowshoes because they are very quiet while recreational use of snowshoes began with snowshoe clubs in quebec  canada  who held events where races and hikes were combined with fine food and drink   the manufacture of snowshoes for recreational purposes really began in the late 19th  century  when serious recreational use became more widespread in the late 20th  century the snowshoe underwent a radical redesign  it started in the 1950s  when the vermont-based  tubbs company created the green mountain bearpaw  which combined the shortness of that style with an even narrower width than had previously been used  pospisil 1979).  this rapidly became one of the most popular snowshoes of its day in 1972,  experimenting with new designs in washington s cascade mountains  gene and bill prater created the snowshoe known today  they began using aluminum tubing and replaced the lace with neoprene and nylon decking  to make them easier to use in mountaineering  the praters developed a hinged binding and added cleats to the bottom of the shoe the sherpa snowshoe company started manufacturing these  western  shoes and they proved very popular  eastern snowshoers were a bit more skeptical at first  believing that the style was unnecessary in the east  until the praters demonstrated their improved effectiveness on new hampshire s mount washington these use an aluminum or stainless steel frame and take advantage of technical advances in plastics and injection molding to make a lighter and more durable shoe  they require little maintenance  and usually incorporate aggressive crampons some  such as the  denali  model made by mountain safety research  use no metal frame and can be fitted with optional detachable tail extenders  newer models have heel-lifters,  called  ascenders   that flip up to facilitate hill climbing the use of solid decking in place of the standard latticework of lacing came as a surprise to many enthusiasts  since it challenged a long-held  belief that the lattice was necessary to prevent snow from accumulating on the shoe  in practice  however  it seems that very little snow comes through the openings in either type of shoe neoprene nylon decks also displayed superior water resistance  neither stretching as rawhide will when wet nor requiring annual treatment with spar varnish  features that were immediately appreciated  eventually they were replaced with even lighter materials such as polypropylene  this tendency also gave way to the creation of inflatable snowshoes made of different fabrics such as cordura and thermoplatic polyurethane  tpu  these more athletic designs have helped the sport enjoy a renaissance after a period of eclipse when winter recreationists showed more interest in skiing  in the u s   the number of snowshoers tripled during the 1990s.in  fact  ski resorts with available land are beginning to offer snowshoe trails to visitors  and some popular hiking areas are almost as busy in the colder months as they are on warm summer weekends as many winter recreationists rediscover snowshoeing  many more new models of snowshoe are becoming available  ski areas and outdoor equipment stores are offering snowshoes for rent snowshoes today are divided into three types sizes are often given in inches  even though snowshoes are nowhere near perfectly rectangular  mountaineering shoes can be at least 30  inches (76  cm  long by 10  inches (25  cm  wide  a lighter pair of racing shoes can be slightly narrower and 25  inches (64  cm  or shorter regardless of configuration  all wooden shoes are referred to as  traditional  and all shoes made of other materials are called  modern  notwithstanding these variations in planned use  larger users should plan on buying larger snowshoes  a common formula is that for every pound of body weight  there should be one square inch of snowshoe surface (14.5  cm² kg  per snowshoe to adequately support the wearer  users should also consider the weight of any gear they will be packing  especially if they expect to break trail  those planning to travel into deep powder look for even larger shoes many manufacturers now include weight-based  flotation ratings for their shoes  although there is no standard for setting this yet as is often the case with downhill skis  wood-frame  snowshoes and suitable bindings are typically marketed and purchased separately rather than as a single piece  one common style is termed the  h  binding  as it consists of a strap around the heel crossing a strap around the toe and one at the instep  forming a rough version of the eponymous letter on modern shoes  there are two styles of binding  fixed-rotation   also known as "limited-rotation")  bindings  and full-rotation   also known as  pivot   with either binding system  the heel is left free  and the difference is in how the ball of the foot is attached to the snowshoe in fixed-rotation  bindings  the binding is attached to the snowshoe with an elastic strap that brings the tail of the snowshoe up with each step  the snowshoe therefore moves with the foot and the tail does not drag  fixed-rotation  bindings are preferred for full-rotation  bindings allow the user s toes to pivot below the deck of the snowshoe  they allow the crampon cleats that are under the foot to be kicked into a slope for grip in climbing  but are relatively awkward for stepping sideways and backwards as the tail of the snowshoe can drag  fixed-rotation  bindings often cause snow to be kicked up the back of the wearer s legs  this does not tend to happen with full-rotation  bindings a series of straps  usually three  are used to fasten the foot to the snowshoe  some styles of binding use a cup for the toe  it is important that a user be able to manipulate these straps easily  as removing or securing the foot often must be done outdoors in cold weather with bare hands  exposing him or her to the possibility of frostbite  when putting on snowshoes  left is distinguished from right by which way the loose ends of the binding straps point  always outward  to avoid stepping on them repeatedly in 1994,  bill torres and a younger associate developed the step-in  binding  designed to make it easier for snowshoers wearing hard-shelled  plastic boots  serious mountaineers  to change from snowshoes to crampons and back again as needed snowshoers often use trekking poles as an accessory to help them keep their balance on the snow  some manufacturers have begun making special snowshoeing models of their poles  with larger baskets more like those found on ski poles  which can also be used  other than that  no other special accessories are required  most types of footwear can be worn with snowshoes  although hiking boots are the preferred choice among most recreational users  except racers  who prefer running shoes   ski boots  however  will only work with certain snowshoes such as the msr denali  otherwise requiring backcountry skiers to carry other footwear for the snowshoe portion of their trip if going into deep snow  snowshoers will often take along gaiters to keep snow from getting into their boots from above  some manufacturers make their snowshoes with boot or toe covers to provide the same protection a carrier of some type is also advisable  particularly if the trip will not take place entirely on snowshoes  some backpack manufacturers have designed special packs with  daisy chains   strips of looped nylon webbing on which the shoes can be secured  snowshoe manufacturers  too  have begun including carriers and tote bags for their products  if for no other reason than to prevent the often-sharp  cleats on the bottom from damaging surfaces they come in contact with since snowshoeing is commonly done in cold weather  users typically prepare for it by dressing in layers and carrying the appropriate equipment snowshoes function best when there is enough snow beneath them to pack a layer between them and the ground  usually at a depth of 8  inches (20  cm  or more  however  contrary to popular belief  snowshoes perform poorly on very icy and steep terrain  compared to crampons  snowshoes give relatively little grip on ice  it is common for novice snowshoers to climb up a steep slope to a summit and then have difficulty climbing back down  which tends to be more difficult than ascending  in icy conditions  summer hiking routes may require mountaineering skills and equipment  not is often said by snowshoers that if you can walk  you can snowshoe  this is true in optimal conditions  but snowshoeing properly requires some slight adjustments to walking  the method of walking is to lift the shoes slightly and slide the inner edges over each other  thus avoiding the unnatural and fatiguing "straddle-gait"  that would otherwise be necessary  a snowshoer must be willing to roll his or her feet slightly as well  an exaggerated stride works best when starting out  particularly with larger or traditional shoes walking skills are easily transferable to straightforward snowshoe travel  but this is not always the case with turning around  while a snowshoer with space to do so can  and usually does  simply walk in a small semicircle  on a steep slope or in close quarters such as a boreal forest this may be impractical or impossible  it is thus necessary in such circumstances to execute a  kick turn  similar to the one employed on skis  lifting one foot high enough to keep the entire snowshoe in the air while keeping the other planted  putting the foot at a right angle to the other  or as close as possible for the situation and the snowshoer s physical comfort   then planting it on the snow and quickly repeating the action with the other foot  this is much easier to accomplish with poles while the cleating and traction improvements to modern snowshoes have greatly enhanced snowshoers  climbing abilities  on very steep slopes it is still beneficial to make  kick steps   kicking the toes of the shoes into the snow to create a kind of snow stairs for the next traveler to use alternatively  snowshoers can use two techniques borrowed from skis  the herringbone  walking uphill with the shoes spread outward at an angle to increase their support  and the sidestep for those snowshoers who use poles  it can be easier to rely on the poles to  pull  oneself with regular stride  up the slope once a trail has been broken up a mountain or hill  snowshoers often find a way to speed up the return trip that manages to also be fun and rests the leg muscles  glissading the trail  or sliding down on their buttocks  this does not damage the trail  and in fact helps pack the snow better for later users in situations where they must break trail downhill and thus cannot glissade  snowshoers sometimes run downhill in exaggerated steps  sliding slightly on the snow as they do  an option sometimes called  step sliding   also effective  are poles placed in front as you descend in a regular stride  if carrying poles and properly experienced  they can also employ skiing techniques such as needed on newly fallen snow it is necessary for a snowshoer to  break  a trail  this is tiring  it may require up to 50%  more energy than simply following behind  even on level terrain  and frequently in groups this work is shared among all participants a trail breaker can improve the quality of the ensuing route by using a technique  similar to the hiking rest step  called  stamping   pausing momentarily after each step before putting full weight on the foot  this helps smooth the snow underneath and compacts it even better for the next user a well-broken  trail is usually a rut in the snow about 6–8  inches (15–20  cm  deep and 2  feet (61  cm  wide  while it may appear after heavy use as if it is possible to  bareboot  or walk it without benefit of snowshoes  this practice is frowned upon by serious snowshoers as it leads to  postholing   or roughening of the trail from places where boots have fallen through  initial appearances to the contrary  the snow in a broken trail is not sufficiently packed to support the more concentrated weight of a foot  in soft conditions  following trails broken by backcountry skiers can be difficult on snowshoes  in addition  since snowshoes destroy ski tracks  many areas ask that snowshoers observe traditional backcountry courtesy and stay out of ski tracks  ski trails are normally much narrower than a typical snowshoe trail  and less well packed because skis offer more flotation than snowshoes  if the snow is deep and soft  snowshoers may find themselves postholing right through the ski track  in most cases the ski track offers little advantage and putting in a separate snowshoe track allows both snowshoers and skiers to have a positive experience and avoids friction with skiers who often resent having their tracks obliterated and their skiing enjoyment greatly reduced snowshoeing expands the potential for exercise available in the wintertime  as of at least 500  american schools  mostly but not exclusively in the northeast have started offering snowshoe programs in their physical education classes to help combat obesity  it had the added benefit of being gentler on the feet than walking or running the equivalent routes  since snow cushions the foot s impact for the same reason  it is less detrimental to the environment  since the snow likewise buffers the earth against the impact of so many hikers and campers  cutting back on trail erosion and other effects of heavy use snowshoeing makes even familiar hikes different and new  if the snow is deep enough  obstacles such as large boulders and fallen logs can be more easily bypassed immoderate snowshoeing leads to serious lameness of the feet and ankles which canadian voyageurs called mal de raquette  modern snowshoes are much lighter and more comfortable so that lameness caused by snowshoeing is now very rare nonetheless  many snowshoers find that their legs  particularly their calf muscles  take some time to get used to snowshoeing again at the start of each winter  frequently the first serious trip leaves them sore for several days afterwards the resurgence of interest in snowshoeing in the late 20th  century was in some part due to snowboarders  who took to them as a way to reach backcountry powder bowls and other areas while they were still banned from most ski areas  their similarities to snowboards  in shape and binding  led many of them to continue use even after snowboarders were allowed to use most ski slopes  despite most ski areas now allowing snowboarders  there is a growing interest in backcountry and sidecountry snowboarding in the search for fresh powder  the recent development of splitboards has enabled snowboarders to access backcountry without the need for snowshoes downhill skiers  too  found snowshoes useful in reaching the same areas another popular expedition  particularly among hikers  is the "ski-shoe"  trip combining a cross-country  ski portion on a level  wide trail with a snowshoe up a less skiable section  usually to a mountain summit runners have found that using light snowshoes allows them to continue exercising and racing during winter  like their warm-weather  counterparts  events cover all distances  from sprints of 100  m to the 100  km  iditashoe   there are even hurdle events snowshoe segments have become common in many multi-sport  events and adventure races  including a required snowshoe segment in the winter quadrathlon  some competitors in those events like sally edwards and tom sobal have emerged as stars while snowshoe racing has probably been around as long as there have been snowshoes  as an organized sport it is relatively new  the united states snowshoe association was founded in 1977  to serve as a governing body for competitive snowshoeing  it is headquartered in corinth  new york  which considers itself the  snowshoe capital of the world  as a result  similar organizations  such as the european snowshoe committee and japan s chikyu network  exist in other countries and there is an international competitive level as well snowshoe races are part of the arctic winter games and the winter special olympics  however  they are not yet an olympic event the rawhide webbing of traditional snowshoes  as noted above  needs regular waterproofing  spar varnish is the preferred waterproofing for traditional snowshoes  a light sanding is preferred before 3  coats of spar varnish is applied  modern snowshoes need no regular maintenance save a sharpening of cleats if desired both kinds of snowshoe  however  can and do break  the most common damage suffered is to the frame  which can be splinted with a stick or piece of wood if necessary  decking rarely gets broken  but if it is punctured and the hole looks as if it might continue to grow  the best solution is the patching kits made for tents cable ties can serve many purposes in repairing snowshoes  they can splint frames in a pinch  replace a broken rivet  secure a tie or lace  and repair winter clothing as well
