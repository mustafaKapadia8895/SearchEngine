carpenters  craftsmen  artisans  sculptors  metallurgy  fire  and hephaestus  roman equivalent is vulcan  in greek mythology  hephaestus was the son of zeus and hera  the king and queen of the gods  in another version  he was hera s parthenogenous child  rejected by his mother because of his deformity and thrown off mount olympus and down to a smithing god  hephaestus made all the weapons of the gods in olympus  he served as the blacksmith of the gods  and was worshipped in the manufacturing and industrial centers of greece  particularly athens  the cult of hephaestus was based in hephaestus  symbols are a smith s hammer  anvil  and a pair of tongs hephaestus is probably associated with the linear b  mycenean greek  inscription êÄÄêÄûêÄÇêÄ¥êÄç  a-pa-i-ti-jo,  found at knossos  the inscription indirectly attests his worship at that time because it is believed that it reads the theophoric name haphaistios or the name of the god in greek  hƒìphaistos  has a root which can be observed in names of places of pre-greek  origin  like (pa-i-to  in linear is given many epithets  the meaning of each epithet had his own palace on olympus  containing his workshop with anvil and twenty bellows that worked at his hephaestus crafted much of the magnificent equipment of the gods  and almost any finely wrought metalwork imbued with powers that appears in greek myth is said to have been forged by hephaestus  he designed hermes  winged helmet and sandals  the aegis breastplate  aphrodite s famed girdle  agamemnon s staff of achilles  armor  heracles  bronze clappers  helios s chariot  the shoulder of pelops  and eros s bow and arrows  in later accounts  hephaestus worked with the help of the chthonic cyclopes‚Äîamong them his assistants in the forge  brontes  steropes and built automatons of metal to work for him  this included tripods that walked to and from mount olympus  he gave to the blinded orion his apprentice cedalion as a guide  in some versions of the needed   prometheus stole the fire that he gave to man from hephaestus s forge  hephaestus also created the gift that the gods gave to man  the woman pandora and her pithos  being a skilled blacksmith  hephaestus created all the thrones in the palace of greek myths and the homeric poems sanctified in stories that hephaestus had a special power to produce he made the golden and silver lions and dogs at the entrance of the palace of alkinoos in such a way that they could bite the the greeks maintained in their civilization an animistic idea that statues are in some sense alive  this kind of art and the animistic belief goes back to the minoan period  when daedalus  the builder of the labyrinth  made images which moved of their own a statue of the god was somehow the god himself  and the image on a man s tomb indicated somehow his odyssey and iliad have hephaestus being born of the union of zeus and in another tradition  attested by hesiod  hera bore hephaestus in hesiod s zeus-centered  cosmology  hera gave birth to hephaestus as revenge for zeus giving birth to athena without her  several later texts follow hesiod s account  including hyginus  and the preface to fabulae  in the account of attic vase painters  hephaestus was present at the birth of athena and wields the axe with which he split zeus  head to free her  in the latter account  hephaestus is there represented as older than athena  so the mythology of hephaestus is inconsistent in this respect in one branch of greek mythology  hera ejected hephaestus from the heavens because he was  shrivelled of foot   he fell into the ocean and was raised by thetis  mother of achilles  and the oceanid another account  hephaestus  attempting to rescue his mother from zeus  advances  was flung down from the heavens by zeus  he fell for an entire day and landed on the island of lemnos  where he was cared for and taught to be a master craftsman by the sintians ‚Äì an ancient tribe native to that later writers describe his lameness as the consequence of his second fall  while homer makes him lame and weak from his birth hephaestus was the only olympian to have returned to olympus after being exiled in an archaic hephaestus gained revenge against hera for rejecting him by making her a magical golden throne  which  when she sat on it  did not allow her to stand the other gods begged hephaestus to return to olympus to let her go  but he refused  saying  i have no last  dionysus fetched him  intoxicated him with wine  and took the subdued smith back to olympus on the back of a mule accompanied by revelers ‚Äì a scene that sometimes appears on painted pottery of attica and of in the painted scenes  the padded dancers and phallic figures of the dionysan throng leading the mule show that the procession was a part of the dithyrambic celebrations that were the forerunners of the satyr plays of fifth century theme of the return of hephaestus  popular among the attic vase-painters  whose wares were favored among the etruscans  may have introduced this theme to in the vase-painters'  portrayal of the procession  hephaestus was mounted on a mule or a horse  with dionysus holding the bridle and carrying hephaestus  tools  including a double-headed  axe  the traveller pausanias reported seeing a painting in the temple of dionysus in athens  which had been built in the 5th  century but may have been decorated at any time before the 2nd  century ce  when pausanias saw it  he said there are paintings here ‚Äì dionysus bringing hephaestus up to heaven  one of the greek legends is that hephaestus  when he was born  was thrown down by hera  in revenge he sent as a gift a golden chair with invisible fetters  when hera sat down she was held fast  and hephaestus refused to listen to any other of the gods except dionysus ‚Äì in him he reposed the fullest trust ‚Äì and after making him drunk dionysus brought him to heaven according to most versions  hephaestus s consort is aphrodite  who is unfaithful to hephaestus with a number of gods and mortals  including ares  however  in book xviii of homer s iliad  the consort of hephaestus is a lesser aphrodite  charis   the grace   or aglaia   the glorious   ‚Äì the youngest of the graces  as hesiod calls athens  there is a temple of hephaestus  the hephaesteum  miscalled the  theseum   near the agora  an athenian founding myth tells that the city s patron goddess  athena  refused a union with hephaestus because of his unsightly appearance and crippled nature  and that when he became angry and forceful with her  she disappeared from the bed  his ejaculate fell on the earth  impregnating gaia  who subsequently gave birth to erichthonius of a surrogate mother later gave the child to athena to foster  guarded by a serpent on the island of lemnos  hephaestus  consort was the sea nymph cabeiro  by whom he was the father of two metalworking gods named the cabeiri  in sicily  his consort was the nymph aetna  and his sons were two gods of sicilian geysers called palici  with thalia  hephaestus was sometimes considered the father of the palici hephaestus fathered several children with mortals and immortals alike  one of those children was the robber periphetes this is the full list of his consorts and children according to the various accounts in addition  the romans claim their equivalent god  vulcan  to have produced the following children though married to hephaestus  aphrodite had an affair with ares  the god of war  eventually  hephaestus discovered aphrodite‚Äôs affair through helios  the all-seeing  sun  and planned a trap during one of their trysts  while aphrodite and ares lay together in bed  hephaestus ensnared them in an unbreakable chain-link  net so small as to be invisible and dragged them to mount olympus to shame them in front of the other gods for retribution the gods laughed at the sight of these naked lovers  and poseidon persuaded hephaestus to free them in return for a guarantee that ares would pay the adulterer s fine  hephaestus states in the odyssey that he would return aphrodite to her father and demand back his bride price the thebans told that the union of ares and aphrodite produced harmonia  however  of the union of hephaestus with aphrodite  there was no issue unless virgil was serious when he said that eros was their later authors explain this statement by saying that eros was sired by ares but passed off to hephaestus as his own son hephaestus was somehow connected with the archaic  pre-greek  phrygian and thracian mystery cult of the kabeiroi  who were also called the hephaistoi   the hephaestus-men",  in lemnos  one of the three lemnian tribes also called themselves hephaestion and claimed direct descent from the god hephaestus is to the male gods as athena is to the females  for he gives skill to mortal artists and was believed to have taught men the arts alongside he was nevertheless believed to be far inferior to the sublime character of athena  at athens they had temples and festivals in both were believed to have great healing powers  and lemnian earth  terra lemnia  from the spot on which hephaestus had fallen was believed to cure madness  the bites of snakes  and haemorrhage  and priests of hephaestus knew how to cure wounds inflicted by was represented in the temple of athena chalcioecus  athena of the bronze at sparta  in the act of delivering his on the chest of cypselus  giving achilles s armour to and at athens there was the famous statue of hephaestus by alcamenes  in which his lameness was only subtly the greeks frequently placed small dwarf-like  statues of hephaestus near their hearths  and these figures are the oldest of all his during the best period of grecian art he was represented as a vigorous man with a beard  and is characterized by his hammer or some other crafting tool  his oval cap  and the chiton athena is sometimes thought to be  the ‚Äòsoul-mate‚Äô  of yet a kind of cloudy mysteriousness shrouds their relationship  no single tradition was ever clearly established on this subject  and so what confronts us is a blurred image based on rumors and conflicting reports   nonetheless  he  seeks impetuously and passionately to make love to athene  at the moment of climax she pushes him aside  and his semen falls to the earth where it impregnates was associated by greek colonists in southern italy with the volcano gods adranus  of mount etna  and vulcanus of the lipari islands  the first-century  sage apollonius of tyana is said to have observed   there are many other mountains all over the earth that are on fire  and yet we should never be done with it if we assigned to them giants and gods like the trojan war  hephaestus sided with the greeks  but was also worshiped by the trojans and saved one of their men from being killed by hephaestus‚Äô favourite place in the mortal world was the island of lemnos  where he liked to dwell among the but he also frequented other volcanic islands such as lipara  hiera  imbros and sicily  which were called his abodes or epithets and surnames by which hephaestus is known by the poets generally allude to his skill in the plastic arts or to his figure or lameness  the greeks frequently placed small dwarf-like  statues of hephaestus near their hearths  and these figures are the oldest of all his was sometimes portrayed as a vigorous man with a beard and was characterized by his hammer or some other crafting tool  his oval cap  and the chiton hephaestus is described in mythological sources as  lame   chol≈çs   and  halting  he was depicted with crippled feet and as misshapen  either from birth or as a result of his fall from olympus  in vase paintings  hephaestus is usually shown lame and bent over his anvil  hard at work on a metal creation  and sometimes with his feet back-to-front:  hephaistos amphigyƒìeis  he walked with the aid of a stick  the argonaut palaimonius   son of hephaestus   i e  a bronze-smith)  was also  sons of hephaestus  were the cabeiri on the island of samothrace  who were identified with the crab  karkinos  by the lexicographer hesychius  the adjective karkinopous ("crab-footed")  signified  lame   according to detienne and the cabeiri were also lame in some myths  hephaestus built himself a  wheeled chair  or chariot with which to move around  thus helping him overcome his lameness while demonstrating his skill to the other in the iliad 18.371,  it is stated that hephaestus built twenty bronze wheeled tripods in order assist him in moving ugly appearance and lameness is taken by some to represent arsenicosis  an effect of high levels of arsenic exposure that would result in lameness and skin cancers  in place of less easily available tin  arsenic was added to copper in the bronze age to harden it  like the hatters  crazed by their exposure to mercury  who inspired lewis carroll s famous character of the mad hatter  most smiths of the bronze age would have suffered from chronic poisoning as a result of their livelihood  consequently  the mythic image of the lame smith is widespread  as hephaestus was an iron-age  smith  not a bronze-age  smith  the connection is one from ancient folk in other mythological systems for hephaestus s symbolism include the minor planet 2212  hephaistos discovered in 1978  by soviet astronomer lyudmila chernykh was named in hephaestus
