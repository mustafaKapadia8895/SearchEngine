 stesichorus -  wikipediastesichorus  greek  στησίχορος  stēsikhoros  c  630  – 555  bc  was the first great lyric poet of the west  he is best known for telling epic stories in lyric but he is also famous for some ancient traditions about his life  such as his opposition to the tyrant phalaris  and the blindness he is said to have incurred and cured by composing verses first insulting and then flattering to helen of troy  he was ranked among the nine lyric poets esteemed by the scholars of hellenistic alexandria and yet his work attracted relatively little interest among ancient so that remarkably few fragments of his poetry now survive  as one scholar observed in 1967:   time has dealt more harshly with stesichorus than with any other major lyric recent discoveries  recorded on egyptian papyrus  notably and controversially  the lille have led to some improvements in our understanding of his work  confirming his role as a link between homer s epic narrative and the lyric narrative of poets like following description of the birthplace of the monster geryon  preserved as a quote by the geographer is characteristic of the  descriptive fulness  of his nineteenth century translation imaginatively fills in the gaps while communicating something of the richness of the language stesichorus exercised an important influence on the representation of myth in 6th  century and on the development of athenian dramatic was born in metauros  modern gioia tauro  in calabria  southern c  630  bc and died in katane  modern catania  in sicily in 555  bc  some say that he came from himera in sicily  but that was due to him moving from metauros to himera later in life  when exiled from pallantium in arcadia he came to katane  catania  and when he died there was buried in front of the gate which is called stesichorean after him  in date he was later than the lyric poet alcman  since he was born in the 37th  olympiad (632/28  bc   he died in the 56th  olympiad (556/2  bc   he had a brother mamertinus who was an expert in geometry and a second brother helianax  a law-giver.  he was a lyric poet  his poems are in the doric dialect and in 26  books  they say that he was blinded for writing abuse of helen and recovered his sight after writing an encomium of helen  the palinode  as the result of a dream  he was called stesichorus because he was the first to establish  stesai  a chorus of singers to the cithara  his name was originally tisias the specific dates given by the suda for stesichorus have been dismissed by one modern scholar as  specious — its dates for the floruit of alcman  the 27th  olympiad   the life of stesichorus (37th–56th  olympiads  and the birth of simonides  the 56th  olympiad  virtually lay these three poets end-to-end,  a coincidence that seems to underscore a convenient division between old and new styles of nevertheless  the suda s dates  fit reasonably well  with other indications of stesichorus s life-span  — for example  they are consistent with a claim elsewhere in suda that the poet sappho was his contemporary  along with alcaeus and pittacus  and also with the claim  attested by other sources  that phalaris was his aristotle quoted a speech the poet is supposed to have made to the people of himera warning them against the tyrannical ambitions of the byzantine grammarian tzetzes also listed him as a contemporary of the tyrant and yet made him a contemporary of the philosopher pythagoras as according to lucian  the poet lived to 85  years of hieronymus declared that his poems became sweeter and more swan-like  as he approached and cicero knew of a bronzed statue representing him as a bent old man holding a eusebius dated his floruit in olympiad 42.2  (611/10  bc  and his death in olympiad 55.1  (560/59  suda s claim that hesiod was the father of stesichorus can be dismissed as yet it is also mentioned by and the hesiodic scholiast  one of them however named the mother of stesichorus via hesiod as ctimene and the other as clymene   according to another tradition known to cicero  stesichorus was the grandson of yet even this verges on anachronism since hesiod was composing verses around 700  stesichorus might be regarded as hesiod s literary  heir   his treatment of helen in the palinode  for example  may have owed much to hesiod s catalogue of and maybe this was the source of confusion about a family according to stephanus of and the philosopher the poet s father was named euphemus  but an inscription on a herm from tivoli listed him as the poet s mathematically inclined brother was named mamertinus by the suda but a scholiast in a commentary on euclid named him lyrical treatment of epic themes was well-suited  to a western greek audience  owing to the popularity of hero-cults  in southern italy and magna graeca  as for example the cult of philoctetes at sybaris  diomedes at thurii and the atreidae at it was also a sympathetic environment for his most famous poem  the palinode  composed in praise of helen  an important cult figure in the doric on the other hand  the western greeks were not very different from their eastern counterparts and his poetry cannot be regarded exclusively as a product of the greek west his poetry reveals both doric and ionian influences and this is consistent with the suda a claim that his birthplace was either metauria or himera  both of which were founded by colonists of mixed ionian doric on the other hand  a doric ionian flavour was fashionable among later poets — it is found in the  choral  lyrics of the ionian poets simonides and bacchylides — and it might have been fashionable even in stesichorus s own his poetry included a description of the river as well as praise for the town named after and his poem geryoneis included a description of pallantium in his possible exile from arcadia is attributed by one modern scholar to rivalry between tegea and traditional accounts indicate that he was politically active in magna graeca  aristotle mentions two public speeches by stesichorus  one to the people of himera  warning them against phalaris  and another to the people of locri  warning them against presumption  possibly referring to their war against philodemus believed that the poet once stood between two armies  which two  he doesn t say  and reconciled them with a song — but there is a similar story about according to the 9th  century scholar photius  the term eight all  used by gamblers at dice  derives from an expensive burial the poet received outside catana  including a monument with eight pillars  eight steps and eight but the 3rd  century grammarian julius pollux attributed the same term to an  eight all ways  tomb given to the poet outside modern scholars don t accept the suda s claim that stesichorus was named for his innovations in choral poetry — there are good reasons to believe that his lyrical narratives were composed for solo performance  see works below   moreover the name wasn t unique — there seems to have been more than one poet of this  see spurious works below   the suda in yet another entry refers to the fact  now verified by papyrus fragments  that stesichorus composed verses in units of three stanzas  strophe  antistrophe and epode   a format later followed by poets such as bacchylides and pindar  suda claims this three-stanza  format was popularly referred to as the three of stesichorus in a proverbial saying rebuking cultural buffoons   you don t even know the three of stesichorus     according to one modern scholar  however  this saying could instead refer to the following three lines of his poem the palinode  addressed to helen of of troy s bad character was a common theme among poets such as sappho and and  according to various ancient accounts  stesichorus viewed her in the same light until she magically punished him with blindness for blaspheming her in one of his according to a colourful account recorded by pausanias  she later sent an explanation to stesichorus via a man from croton  who was on a pilgrimage to white island in the black sea  near the mouth of the blue danube   and it was in response to this that stesichorus composed the absolving her of all blame for the trojan war and thus restoring himself to full sight the ancients associated the lyrical qualities of stesichorus with the voice of the nightingale  as in this quote from the palatine anthology      at his birth  when he had just reached the light of day  a nightingale  travelling through the air from somewhere or other  perched unnoticed on his lips and struck up her clear the account is repeated by pliny the but it was the epic qualities of his work that most impressed ancient though with some reservations on the part of quintillian  the greatness of stesichorus  genius is shown among other things by his subject-matter:  he sings of the most important wars and the most famous commanders and sustains on his lyre the weight of epic poetry  in both their actions and their speeches he gives due dignity to his characters  and if only he had shown restraint he could possibly have been regarded as a close rival of homer  but he is redundant and diffuse  a fault to be sure but explained by the abundance of what he had to say   a similar vein  dionysius of halicarnassus commends stesichorus for     the magnificence of the settings of his subject matter  in them he has preserved the traits and reputations of his and longinus puts him in select company with herodotus  archilochus and plato as the  most homeric  of scholars tend to accept the general thrust of the ancient comments – even the  fault  noted by quintillian gets endorsement   longwindedness   as one modern scholar calls it  citing  as proof of it  the interval of 400  lines separating geryon s death from his eloquent anticipation of similarly   the repetitiveness and slackness of the style  of the recently discovered lille papyrus has even been interpreted by one modern scholar as proof of stesichorean – though others originally used it as an argument possibly stesichorus was even more homeric than ancient commentators realized – they had assumed that he composed verses for performance by choirs  the triadic structure of the stanzas  comprising strophe  antistrophe and epode  is consistent with choreographed movement  but a poem such as the geryoneis included some 1500  lines and it probably required about four hours to perform – longer than a chorus might reasonably be expected to moreover  the versatility of lyric meter is suited to solo performance with self-accompaniment  on the – which is how homer himself delivered poetry  whether or not it was a choral technique  the triadic structure of stesichorean lyrics allowed for novel arrangements of dactylic meter – the dominant meter in his poems and also the defining meter of homeric epic – thus allowing for homeric phrasing to be adapted to new settings  however  stesichorus did more than recast the form of epic poetry – works such as the palinode were also a recasting of epic material  in that version of the trojan war  the combatants fought over a phantom helen while the real helen either stayed home or went to egypt  see a summarybelow   the  lyric age  of greece was in part self-discovery  and self-expression  – as in the works of alcaeus and sappho – but a concern for heroic values and epic themes still endured  stesichorus  citharodic narrative points to the simultaneous coexistence of different literary genres and currents in an age of great artistic energy and experimentation  it is one of the exciting qualities of early greek culture that forms continue to evolve  but the old traditions still remain strong as points of stability and proud community  unifying but not suffocating   – charles homeric qualities of stesichorus  poetry are demonstrated in a fragment of his poem geryoneis describing the death of the monster geryon  a scholiast writing in a margin on hesiod s theogony noted that stesichorus gave the monster wings  six hands and six feet  whereas hesiod himself had only described it as yet stesichorus adapted homeric motifs to create a humanized portrait of the whose death in battle mirrors the death of gorgythion in homer s iliad  translated here by richard lattimore homer here transforms gorgythion s death in battle into a thing of beauty—the poppy has not wilted or stesichorus adapted the simile to restore death s ugliness while still retaining the poignancy of the mutual self-reflection  of the two passages is part of the novel aesthetic experience that stesichorus here puts into the enduring freshness of his art  in spite of its epic traditions  is borne out by ammianus marcellinus in an anecdote about socrates  happening to overhear  on the eve of his own execution  the rendition of a song of stesichorus  the old philosopher asked to be taught it   so that i may know something more when i depart from life   the queen s speech in the lille fragment for more on stesichorus s style his works  according to the suda  were collected in 26  books but each of these was probably a long  narrative poem  the titles of more than half of them are recorded by ancient poems were wrongly attributed to stesichorus by ancient sources  including bucolic poems and some love songs such as calyce and rhadine  it is possible that these are the works of another stesichorus belonging to the fourth century  mentioned in the marmor about twelve miles outside rome  was the original site of a monument dating from the augustan period and now located in the capitoline museum  the stone monument features scenes from the fall of troy  depicted in low relief  and an inscription  ιλίου πέρσις κατα στησίχορον   sack of troy according to scholars are divided as to whether or not it accurately depicts incidents described by stesichorus in his poem sack of troy  there is  for example  a scene showing aeneas and his father anchises departing  for hesperia  with  sacred objects   which might have more to do with the poetry of virgil than with that of media related to
