 holocene -  wikipediathe holocene    ˈhɒləˌsiːn  is the geological epoch that began after the at approximately 11,700  years before the holocene is part of the quaternary period  its name comes from the ancient greek words ὅλος  holos  whole or entire  and καινός  kainos  new   meaning  entirely it has been identified with the current warm period  known as mis 1,  and is considered by some to be an interglacial period the holocene encompasses the growth and impacts of the human species worldwide  including all its written history  development of major civilizations  and overall significant transition toward urban living in the present  human impacts on modern-era  earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for future evolution of living species  including approximately synchronous lithospheric evidence  or more recently atmospheric evidence of human impacts  the international commission on stratigraphy subcommission on quaternary stratigraphy’s working group on the  anthropocene   coined by paul crutzen and eugene stoermer in 2000)  note this term is used to denote the present time interval in which many geologically significant conditions and processes have been profoundly altered by human activities  the  anthropocene  is not a formally defined geological is accepted by the international commission on stratigraphy that the holocene started approximately 11,700  years the subcommission on quaternary stratigraphy quotes gibbard and van kolfschoten in gradstein ogg and smith in stating the term  recent  as an alternative to holocene is invalid and should not be used and also observe that the term flandrian  derived from marine transgression sediments on the flanders coast of belgium has been used as a synonym for holocene by authors who consider the last 10  000  years should have the same stage-status  as previous interglacial events and thus be included in the the international commission on stratigraphy however considers the holocene an epoch following the pleistocene and specifically the last glacial period  local names for the last glacial period include the wisconsinan in north the weichselian in the devensian in the llanquihue in and the otiran in new holocene can be subdivided into five time intervals  or chronozones  based on climatic blytt–sernander classification of climatic periods defined  initially  by plant remains in peat mosses  is now being explored currently by geologists working in different regions studying sea levels  peat bogs and ice core samples by a variety of methods  with a view toward further verifying and refining the blytt–sernander sequence  they find a general correspondence across eurasia and north america  though the method was once thought to be of no interest  the scheme was defined for northern europe  but the climate changes were claimed to occur more widely  the periods of the scheme include a few of the final pre-holocene  oscillations of the last glacial period and then classify climates of more recent needed paleontologists have not defined any faunal stages for the holocene  if subdivision is necessary  periods of human technological development  such as the mesolithic  neolithic  and bronze age  are usually used  however  the time periods referenced by these terms vary with the emergence of those technologies in different parts of the needed climatically  the holocene may be divided evenly into the hypsithermal and neoglacial periods  the boundary coincides with the start of the bronze age in europe  according to some scholars  a third division  the anthropocene  has now motions due to plate tectonics are less than a kilometre over a span of only 10,000  years  however  ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35  m (115  ft  in the early part of the holocene  in addition  many areas above about 40  degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180  m (590  ft  due to post-glacial  rebound over the late pleistocene and holocene  and are still rising sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea  holocene marine fossils are known  for example  from vermont and michigan  other than higher-latitude  temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression  holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed  floodplain  and cave deposits  holocene marine deposits along low-latitude  coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely tectonic uplift of non-glacial  needed]post-glacial  rebound in the scandinavia region resulted in the formation of the baltic sea  the region continues to rise  still causing weak earthquakes across northern europe  the equivalent event in north america was the rebound of hudson bay  as it shrank from its larger  immediate post-glacial  tyrrell sea phase  to near its present needed climate has been fairly stable over the holocene  ice core records show that before the holocene there was global warming after the end of the last ice age and cooling periods  but climate changes became more regional at the start of the younger dryas  during the transition from the last glacial to the holocene  the huelmo–mascardi cold reversal in the southern hemisphere began before the younger dryas  and the maximum warmth flowed south to north from 11,000  to 7,000  years ago  it appears that this was influenced by the residual glacial ice remaining in the northern hemisphere until the later needed the holocene climatic optimum  hco  was a period of warming in which the global climate became warmer  however  the warming was probably not uniform across the world  this period of warmth ended about 5,500  years ago with the descent into the neoglacial and concomitant neopluvial  at that time  the climate was not unlike today s  but there was a slightly warmer period from the 10th–14th  centuries known as the medieval warm period  this was followed by the little ice age  from the 13th  or 14th  century to the mid-19th  century  which was a period of needed compared to glacial conditions  habitable zones have expanded northwards  reaching their northernmost point during the hco  greater moisture in the polar regions has caused the disappearance of needed the temporal and spatial extent of holocene climate change is an area of considerable uncertainty  with radiative forcing recently proposed to be the origin of cycles identiﬁed in the north atlantic region  climate cyclicity through the holocene  bond events  has been observed in or near marine settings and is strongly controlled by glacial input to the north periodicities of ≈2500,  ≈1500,  and ≈1000  years are generally observed in the north at the same time spectral analyses of the continental record  which is remote from oceanic influence  reveal persistent periodicities of 1000  and 500  years that may correspond to solar activity variations during the holocene a 1500-year  cycle corresponding to the north atlantic oceanic circulation may have had widespread global distribution in the late and plant life have not evolved much during the relatively short holocene  but there have been major shifts in the distributions of plants and animals  a number of large animals including mammoths and mastodons  saber-toothed  cats like smilodon and homotherium  and giant sloths disappeared in the late pleistocene and early holocene—especially in north america  where animals that survived elsewhere  including horses and camels  became extinct  this extinction of american megafauna has been explained as caused by the arrival of the ancestors of amerindians  though most scientists assert that climatic change also contributed  in addition  a controversial bolide impact over north america has been hypothesized to have triggered the younger the world  ecosystems in cooler climates that were previously regional have been isolated in higher altitude ecological 8.2  ka event  an abrupt cold spell recorded as a negative excursion in the δ18o  record lasting 400  years  is the most prominent climatic event occurring in the holocene epoch  and may have marked a resurgence of ice cover  it has been suggested that this event was caused by the final drainage of lake agassiz  which had been confined by the glaciers  disrupting the thermohaline circulation of the subsequent research however  suggested that the discharge was probably superimposed upon a longer episode of cooler climate lasting up to 600  years and observed that the extent of the area affected was beginning of the holocene corresponds with the beginning of the mesolithic age in most of europe  but in regions such as the middle east and anatolia with a very early neolithisation  epipaleolithic is preferred in place of mesolithic  cultures in this period include hamburgian  federmesser  and the natufian culture  during which the oldest inhabited places still existing on earth were first settled  such as jericho in the middle there is also evolving archeological evidence of proto-religion  at locations such as göbekli tepe  as long ago as the 9th  millennium are followed by the aceramic neolithic (pre-pottery  neolithic a and pre-pottery  neolithic b  and the pottery neolithic  the late holocene brought advancements such as the bow and arrow and saw new methods of warfare in north america  spear throwers and their large points were replaced by the bow and arrow with its small narrow points beginning in oregon and washington  villages built on defensive bluffs indicate increased warfare  leading to food gathering in communal groups for protection rather than individual
