 hurricane able (1951)  -  wikipediahurricane able was a rare hurricane that formed outside the typical north atlantic hurricane season  the first tropical cyclone in 1951,  able developed from a trough of low pressure on may 15  about 300  miles (480  km  south of bermuda  initially subtropical in nature  able acquired tropical characteristics as it moved over the warm waters of the gulf stream and attained hurricane status on may 17  off the coast of florida  this made able one of only four may atlantic hurricanes on record  on may 22  able reached peak winds of 90  mph (150  km h  about 70  miles (115  km  off cape hatteras  north carolina  the hurricane weakened as it turned eastward  and became an extratropical cyclone on may 23.hurricane  able did not affect land significantly  in florida  the storm dropped light precipitation  while in the bahamas it produced winds of up to 95  mph (152  km h   from north carolina through new england  able produced higher than normal tides  no casualties were reported an active trough of low pressure exited the east coast of the united states on may 12,  and by the following day it passed near bermuda  initially the trough was located only near the surface  though as cold air from behind it advanced eastward  the trough extended into the mid-  to upper-levels  of the atmosphere  by may 14  a closed low pressure area developed in seclusion from the westerlies  continued cold air from behind the trough  about 12°  f (7°  c  colder than usual for the time of year  extended across the low in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures  resulting in large amounts of instability  the polar trough gradually weakened as the low organized  and on may 15  it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300  miles (480  km  south of under an upper-level  low  the depression initially tracked briskly to the northwest  followed by a turn to the west-southwest  on may 16  as the upper-level  low turned southwestward  later on the 16th,  the depression approached the warmest waters of the gulf stream  strong divergence from the upper-level  low and a high pressure system to its northeast provided favorable conditions towards transitioning into a tropical and late on the 16th  the depression attained winds of 40  mph (65  the storm continued to intensify as it turned to the southwest  and early on may 17  a ship near the center reported about 55  mph (88  km h  winds and up to 30  foot (9  m  waves while located about 125  miles (200  km  east of daytona beach  florida  indicating the system transitioned into a tropical storm  the navy reconnaissance squadron flew into the system later that day  and reported a storm of full hurricane strength moving the name able  the small hurricane turned to the southeast and to the east while passing near or over the bahama banks  able subsequently turned to the northeast and later to the north  and finished executing its cyclonic loop on may 20.  the hurricane continued to intensify with an eye 20  miles (32  km  in diameter  and on may 21  reconnaissance aircraft estimated the hurricane attained peak winds of 90  mph (150  km h   shortly thereafter able passed about 70  miles (110  km  east of cape hatteras  north carolina  and early on may 22  able weakened from its peak intensity after turning to the east  on may 23  it deteriorated into a tropical storm while passing over cooler waters  and that night able became an extratropical cyclone while located about 520  miles (840  km  south of halifax  nova scotia  the extratropical remnant turned to the northeast before losing its identity late on may warnings were issued from savannah  georgia to fort pierce  florida subsequent to the discovery of the the national weather bureau advised all small craft to remain at and recommended residents in the northern bahamas to take immediate on grand bahama  the threat of hurricane able resulted in a construction crew to evacuate further inland  the crew was constructing an observation post for guiding long-range  missiles from cape canaveral  fishermen on dozens of boats left the open ocean for safety on two bahamian islands  while two airplanes safely rode out the small craft warnings and storm warnings were later issued from north carolina through new outer rainbands of able produced light rainfall and high seas along the florida while moving slowly near the bahamas  able produced strong winds reaching 90  to 95  mph (145  to 152  km h  at walker cay  and minimal hurricane force on grand bahama and little abaco the hurricane produced high surf in wilmington  north carolina and abnormally high tides northward through new england  though no damage was a ship called  city of eastbourne  sailed through the storm and reported hurricane-force  winds  along with  mountainous  confused seas and driving is one of only four north atlantic hurricanes on record to exist during the month of may  the others occurring in 1889,  1908,  and 1970.  none of the others reached winds of more than 80  mph (130  km h   it was described as  wrong way  wrong time   referring to its unusual motion to the southwest near the bahamas  as well as its presence outside the normal hurricane season  additionally  the weather bureau described it as a  freak of
