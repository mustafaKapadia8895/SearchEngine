 vasco da gama -  wikipediavasco da gama  1st  count of vidigueira  portuguese pronunciation  ðɐ ˈɣɐmɐ   c  1460s  – 24  december 1524),  was a portuguese explorer and the first european to reach india by sea  his initial voyage to india (1497–1499)  was the first to link europe and asia by an ocean route  connecting the atlantic and the indian oceans and therefore  the west and the orient da gama s discovery of the sea route to india was significant and opened the way for an age of global imperialism and for the portuguese to establish a long-lasting  colonial empire in asia  traveling the ocean route allowed the portuguese to avoid sailing across the highly disputed mediterranean and traversing the dangerous arabian peninsula  the sum of the distances covered in the outward and return voyages made this expedition the longest ocean voyage ever made until then  far longer than a full voyage around the world by way of the decades of sailors trying to reach the indies  with thousands of lives and dozens of vessels lost in shipwrecks and attacks  da gama landed in calicut on 20  may 1498.  unopposed access to the indian spice routes boosted the economy of the portuguese empire  which was previously based along northern and coastal west africa  the spices obtained from southeast asia were primarily pepper and cinnamon at first  but soon included other products  all new to europe  portugal maintained a commercial monopoly of these commodities for several decades  it would be a century later before other european powers such as the netherlands and england  followed by france and denmark  were able to challenge portugal s monopoly and naval supremacy in the cape route da gama led two of the portuguese armadas destined for india  the first and the fourth  the latter was the largest and departed for india four years after his return from the first one  for his contributions  da gama was appointed the governor of india in 1524,  under the title of viceroy  and given the newly created county of vidigueira in 1519.  vasco da gama remains a leading figure in the history of exploration  numerous homages have been made worldwide to celebrate his explorations and accomplishments  the portuguese national epic  os lusíadas  was written in his honour  his first trip to india is widely considered a milestone in world history  as it marked the beginning of a sea-based  phase of global march 2016,  researchers announced that thousands of artifacts and vessel remains had been recovered from the ship esmeralda  one of da gama s armada  found off the coast of da gama was born in 1460  or in sines  on the southwest coast of portugal  probably in a house near the church of nossa senhora das salas  sines  one of the few seaports on the alentejo coast  consisted of little more than a cluster of whitewashed  red-tiled  cottages  occupied chiefly by fisherfolk vasco da gama s father was estêvão da gama  who had served in the 1460s  as a knight of the household of infante ferdinand  duke of he rose in the ranks of the military order of santiago  estêvão da gama was appointed alcaide-mór   civil governor  of sines in the 1460s,  a post he held until 1478;  after that he continued as a receiver of taxes and holder of the order s commendas in the region estêvão da gama married isabel sodré  a daughter of joão sodré  also known as joão de resende   scion of a well-connected  family of english her father and her brothers  vicente sodré and brás sodré  had links to the household of infante diogo  duke of viseu  and were prominent figures in the military order of christ  vasco da gama was the third of five sons of estêvão da gama and isabel sodré – in  probable  order of age  paulo da gama  joão sodré  vasco da gama  pedro da gama and aires da gama  vasco also had one known sister  teresa da gama  who married lopo mendes de is known of da gama s early life  the portuguese historian teixeira de aragão suggests that he studied at the inland town of évora  which is where he may have learned mathematics and navigation  it has been claimed that he studied under abraham zacuto  an astrologer and astronomer  but da gama s biographer subrahmanyam thinks this 1480,  da gama followed his father  rather than the sodrés  and joined the order of the master of santiago was prince john  who ascended to the throne in 1481  as king john ii of portugal  john ii doted on the order  and the da gamas  prospects rose accordingly in 1492,  john ii dispatched da gama on a mission to the port of setúbal and to the algarve to seize french ships in retaliation for peacetime depredations against portuguese shipping – a task that da gama rapidly and effectively the earlier part of the 15th  century  portuguese expeditions organized by prince henry the navigator had been reaching down the african coastline  principally in search of west african riches  notably  gold   they had greatly extended portuguese maritime knowledge  but had little profit to show for the effort  after henry s death in 1460,  the portuguese crown showed little interest in continuing this effort and  in 1469,  sold off the neglected african enterprise to a private lisbon merchant consortium led by fernão gomes  within a few years  gomes  captains expanded portuguese knowledge across the gulf of guinea  doing business in gold dust  melegueta pepper  ivory and sub-saharan  slaves  when gomes  charter came up for renewal in 1474,  prince john  future john ii   asked his father afonso v of portugal to pass the african charter to him upon becoming king in 1481,  john ii of portugal set out on many long reforms  to break the monarch s dependence on the feudal nobility  john ii needed to build up the royal treasury  he considered royal commerce to be the key to achieving that  under john ii s watch  the gold and slave trade in west africa was greatly expanded  he was eager to break into the highly profitable spice trade between europe and asia  which was conducted chiefly by land  at the time  this was virtually monopolized by the republic of venice  who operated overland routes via levantine and egyptian ports  through the red sea across to the spice markets of india  john ii set a new objective for his captains  to find a sea route to asia by sailing around the african continent by the time vasco da gama was in his 20s,  the king s plans were coming to fruition  in 1487,  john ii dispatched two spies  pero da covilhã and afonso de paiva  overland via egypt to east africa and india  to scout the details of the spice markets and trade routes  the breakthrough came soon after  when john ii s captain bartolomeu dias returned from rounding the cape of good hope in 1488,  having explored as far as the fish river  rio do infante  in modern-day  south africa and having verified that the unknown coast stretched away to the northeast an explorer was needed who could prove the link between the findings of dias and those of da covilhã and de paiva  and connect these separate segments into a potentially lucrative trade route across the indian ocean on 8  july 1497  vasco da gama led a fleet of four ships with a crew of 170  men from lisbon  the distance traveled in the journey around africa to india and back was greater than around the the navigators included portugal s most experienced  pero de alenquer  pedro escobar  joão de coimbra  and afonso gonçalves  it is not known for certain how many people were in each ship s crew but approximately 55  returned  and two ships were lost  two of the vessels were as naus or newly built for the voyage  possibly a caravel and a supply four ships were the expedition set sail from lisbon on 8  july 1497.  it followed the route pioneered by earlier explorers along the coast of africa via tenerife and the cape verde islands  after reaching the coast of present-day  sierra leone  da gama took a course south into the open ocean  crossing the equator and seeking the south atlantic westerlies that bartolomeu dias had discovered in this course proved successful and on 4  november 1497,  the expedition made landfall on the african coast  for over three months the ships had sailed more than 10,000  kilometres (6,000  mi  of open ocean  by far the longest journey out of sight of land made by that 16  december  the fleet had passed the great fish river  eastern cape  south africa  – where dias had turned back – and sailed into waters previously unknown to europeans  with christmas pending  da gama and his crew gave the coast they were passing the name natal  which carried the connotation of  birth of christ  in portuguese vasco da gama spent 2  to 29  march 1498  in the vicinity of mozambique island  arab-controlled  territory on the east african coast was an integral part of the network of trade in the indian ocean  fearing the local population would be hostile to christians  da gama impersonated a muslim and gained audience with the sultan of mozambique  with the paltry trade goods he had to offer  the explorer was unable to provide a suitable gift to the ruler  soon the local populace became suspicious of da gama and his men  forced by a hostile crowd to flee mozambique  da gama departed the harbor  firing his cannons into the city in the vicinity of modern kenya  the expedition resorted to piracy  looting arab merchant ships that were generally unarmed trading vessels without heavy cannons  the portuguese became the first known europeans to visit the port of mombasa from 7  to 13  april 1498,  but were met with hostility and soon departed vasco da gama continued north  arriving on 14  april 1498  at the friendlier port of malindi  whose leaders were having a conflict with those of mombasa  there the expedition first noted evidence of indian traders  da gama and his crew contracted the services of a pilot who used his knowledge of the monsoon winds to guide the expedition the rest of the way to calicut  located on the southwest coast of india  sources differ over the identity of the pilot  calling him variously a christian  a muslim  and a gujarati  one traditional story describes the pilot as the famous arab navigator ibn majid  but other contemporaneous accounts place majid elsewhere  and he could not have been near the vicinity at the none of the portuguese historians of the time mentions ibn majid  vasco da gama left malindi for india on 24  april 1498.the  fleet arrived in kappadu near kozhikode  calicut   in malabar coast  present day kerala state of india   on 20  may 1498.  the king of calicut  the samudiri  zamorin   who was at that time staying in his second capital at ponnani  returned to calicut on hearing the news of the foreign fleets s arrival  the navigator was received with traditional hospitality  including a grand procession of at least 3,000  armed nairs  but an interview with the zamorin failed to produce any concrete results  the presents that da gama sent to the zamorin as gifts from dom manuel—four cloaks of scarlet cloth  six hats  four branches of corals  twelve almasares  a box with seven brass vessels  a chest of sugar  two barrels of oil and a cask of honey—were trivial  and failed to impress  while zamorin s officials wondered at why there was no gold or silver  the muslim merchants who considered da gama their rival suggested that the latter was only an ordinary pirate and not a royal vasco da gama s request for permission to leave a factor behind him in charge of the merchandise he could not sell was turned down by the king  who insisted that da gama pay customs duty—preferably in gold—like any other trader  which strained the relation between the two  annoyed by this  da gama carried a few nairs and sixteen fishermen  mukkuva  off with him by nevertheless  da gama s expedition was successful beyond all reasonable expectation  bringing in cargo that was worth sixty times the cost of the expedition vasco da gama left calicut on 29  august 1498.  eager to set sail for home  he ignored the local knowledge of monsoon wind patterns that were still blowing onshore  the fleet initially inched north along the indian coast  and then anchored in at anjediva island for a spell  they finally struck out for their indian ocean crossing on 3  october 1498.  but with the winter monsoon yet to set in  it was a harrowing journey  on the outgoing journey  sailing with the summer monsoon wind  da gama s fleet crossed the indian ocean in only 23  days  now  on the return trip  sailing against the wind  it took 132  days da gama saw land again only on 2  january 1499,  passing before the coastal somali city of mogadishu  then under the influence of the ajuran empire in the horn of africa  the fleet did not make a stop  but passing before mogadishu  the anonymous diarist of the expedition noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and big palaces in its center and many mosques with cylindrical gama s fleet finally arrived in malindi on 7  january 1499,  in a terrible state – approximately half of the crew had died during the crossing  and many of the rest were afflicted with scurvy  not having enough crewmen left standing to manage three ships  da gama ordered the são rafael scuttled off the east african coast  and the crew re-distributed  to the remaining two ships  the são gabriel and the berrio  thereafter  the sailing was smoother  by early march  they had arrived in mossel bay  and crossed the cape of good hope in the opposite direction on 20  march  reaching the west african coast by 25  april the diary record of the expedition ends abruptly here  reconstructing from other sources  it seems they continued to cape verde  where nicolau coelho s berrio separated from vasco da gama s são gabriel and sailed on by the berrio arrived in lisbon on 10  july 1499  and nicolau coelho personally delivered the news to king manuel i and the royal court  then assembled in sintra  in the meantime  back in cape verde  da gama s brother  paulo da gama  had fallen grievously ill  da gama elected to stay by his side on santiago island and handed the são gabriel over to his clerk  joão de sá  to take home  the são gabriel under sá arrived in lisbon sometime in late july or early august  da gama and his sickly brother eventually hitched a ride with a guinea caravel returning to portugal  but paulo da gama died en route  da gama got off at the azores to bury his brother at the monastery of são francisco in angra do heroismo  and he lingered there for a little while in mourning  he eventually took passage on an azorean caravel and finally arrived in lisbon on 29  august 1499   according to or early september (8th  or 18th,  according to other sources   despite his melancholic mood  da gama was given a hero s welcome and showered with honors  including a triumphal procession and public festivities  king manuel wrote two letters in which he described da gama s first voyage  in july and august 1499,  soon after the return of the ships  girolamo sernigi also wrote three letters describing da gama s first voyage soon after the return of the expedition the expedition had exacted a large cost – one ship and over half the men had been lost  it had also failed in its principal mission of securing a commercial treaty with calicut  nonetheless  the spices brought back on the remaining two ships were sold at an enormous profit to the crown  vasco da gama was justly celebrated for opening a direct sea route to asia  his path would be followed up thereafter by yearly portuguese india armadas the spice trade would prove to be a major asset to the portuguese royal treasury  and other consequences soon followed  for example  da gama s voyage had made it clear that the east coast of africa  the contra costa  was essential to portuguese interests  its ports provided fresh water  provisions  timber  and harbors for repairs  and served as a refuge where ships could wait out unfavorable weather  one significant result was the colonization of mozambique by the portuguese crown in december 1499,  king manuel i of portugal rewarded vasco da gama with the town of sines as a hereditary fief  the town his father  estêvão  had once held as a commenda   this turned out to be a complicated affair  for sines still belonged to the order of santiago  the master of the order  jorge de lencastre  might have endorsed the reward – after all  da gama was a santiago knight  one of their own  and a close associate of lencastre himself  but the fact that sines was awarded by the king provoked lencastre to refuse out of principle  lest it encourage the king to make other donations of the order s da gama would spend the next few years attempting to take hold of sines  an effort that would estrange him from lencastre and eventually prompt da gama to abandon his beloved order of santiago  switching over to the rival order of christ in 1507.in  the meantime  da gama made do with a substantial hereditary royal pension of 300,000  reis  he was awarded the noble title of dom  lord  in perpetuity for himself  his siblings and their descendants  on 30  january 1502,  da gama was awarded the title of almirante dos mares de arabia  persia  india e de todo o oriente   admiral of the seas of arabia  persia  india and all the orient   – an overwrought title reminiscent of the ornate castilian title borne by christopher columbus  evidently  manuel must have reckoned that if castile had an  admiral of the ocean seas   then surely portugal should have one another royal letter  dated october 1501,  gave da gama the personal right to intervene and exercise a determining role on any future india-bound  fleet around 1501,  vasco da gama married catarina de ataíde  daughter of álvaro de ataíde  the alcaide-mór  of alvor  algarve   and a prominent nobleman connected by kinship with the powerful almeida family  catarina was a first cousin of d  francisco de follow-up  expedition  the second india armada  launched in 1500  under the command of pedro álvares cabral with the mission of making a treaty with the zamorin of calicut and setting up a portuguese factory in the city  however  pedro cabral entered into a conflict with the local arab merchant guilds  with the result that the portuguese factory was overrun in a riot and up to 70  portuguese were killed  cabral blamed the zamorin for the incident and bombarded the city  thus war broke out between portugal and calicut vasco da gama invoked his royal letter to take command of the 4th  india armada  scheduled to set out in 1502,  with the explicit aim of taking revenge upon the zamorin and force him to submit to portuguese terms  the heavily armed fleet of fifteen ships and eight hundred men left lisbon on 12  february 1502.  it was followed in april by another squadron of five ships led by his cousin  estêvão da gama  the son of aires da gama   which caught up to them in the indian ocean  the 4th  armada was a veritable da gama family affair  two of his maternal uncles  vicente sodré and brás sodré  were pre-designated  to command an indian ocean naval patrol  while brothers-in-law  álvaro de ataíde  brother of vasco s wife catarina  and lopo mendes de vasconcelos  betrothed to teresa da gama  vasco s sister  captained ships in the main fleet on the outgoing voyage  da gama s fleet opened contact with the east african gold trading port of sofala and reduced the sultanate of kilwa to tribute  extracting a substantial sum of gold  on reaching india in october 1502,  da gama s fleet set about capturing any arab vessel he came across in indian waters  most notoriously the miri  a pilgrim ship from mecca  whose passengers he massacred in open he then appeared before calicut  demanding redress for the treatment of cabral  while the zamorin was willing to sign a new da gama made a call to the hindu king to expel all muslims from calicut before beginning negotiations  which was turned down  the portuguese fleet then bombarded the city for nearly two days from the sea shore  severely damaging the unfortified city  he also captured several rice vessels and cut off the crew s hands  ears and noses  dispatching them with an insulting note to the violent treatment meted out by da gama quickly brought trade along the malabar coast of india  upon which calicut depended  to a standstill  but the zamorin nonetheless refused to submit to portuguese terms  and even ventured to hire a fleet of strong warships to challenge da gama s armada  which da gama managed to defeat in a naval battle before calicut harbor   da gama loaded up with spices at cochin and cannanore  small nearby kingdoms  half-vassal  and half-at-war  with the zamorin  whose alliances had been secured by prior portuguese fleets  the 4th  armada left india in early 1503.  da gama left behind a small squadron of caravels under the command of his uncle  vicente sodré  to patrol the indian coast  to continue harassing calicut shipping  and to protect the portuguese factories at cochin and cannanore from the zamorin s inevitable reprisals vasco da gama arrived back in portugal in september 1503,  effectively having failed in his mission to bring the zamorin to submission  this failure  and the subsequent more galling failure of his uncle vicente sodré to protect the portuguese factory in cochin  probably counted against any further rewards  when the portuguese king manuel i of portugal decided to appoint the first governor and viceroy of portuguese india in 1505,  da gama was conspicuously overlooked  and the post given to francisco de almeida on his second voyage  vasco da gama inflicted acts of cruelty upon competing traders and local inhabitants  which sealed his notoriety in during his second voyage to calicut  da gama intercepted a ship of muslim pilgrims at madayi travelling from calicut to mecca  described in detail by eyewitness thomé lopes and chronicler gaspar correia  da gama looted the ship with over 400  pilgrims on board including 50  women  locked in the passengers  the owner and an ambassador from egypt and burned them to death  they offered their wealth  which  could ransom all the christian slaves in the kingdom of fez and much more  but were not spared  da gama looked on through the porthole and saw the women bringing up their gold and jewels and holding up their babies to beg for demanding the expulsion of muslims from calicut to the hindu zamorin  the latter sent the high priest talappana namboothiri  the very same person who conducted da gama to the zamorin s chamber during his much celebrated first visit to calicut in may 1498)  for talks  da gama called him a spy  ordered the priests  lips and ears to be cut off and after sewing a pair of dog s ears to his head  sent him the next two decades  vasco da gama lived out a quiet life  unwelcome in the royal court and sidelined from indian affairs  his attempts to return to the favor of manuel i  including switching over to the order of christ in 1507),  yielded little  almeida  the larger-than-life  afonso de albuquerque and  later on  albergaria and sequeira  were the king s preferred point men for india after ferdinand magellan defected to the crown of castile in 1518,  vasco da gama threatened to do the same  prompting the king to undertake steps to retain him in portugal and avoid the embarrassment of losing his own  admiral of the indies  to in 1519,  after years of ignoring his petitions  king manuel i finally hurried to give vasco da gama a feudal title  appointing him the first count of vidigueira  a count title created by a royal decree issued in évora on 29  december  after a complicated agreement with dom jaime  duke of braganza  who ceded him on payment the towns of vidigueira and vila dos frades  the decree granted vasco da gama and his heirs all the revenues and privileges thus establishing da gama as the first portuguese count who was not born with royal the death of king manuel i in late 1521,  his son and successor  king john iii of portugal set about reviewing the portuguese government overseas  turning away from the old albuquerque clique  now represented by diogo lopes de sequeira   john iii looked for a fresh start  vasco da gama re-emerged  from his political wilderness as an important adviser to the new king s appointments and strategy  seeing the new spanish threat to the maluku islands as the priority  vasco da gama advised against the obsession with arabia that had pervaded much of the manueline period  and continued to be the dominant concern of duarte de menezes  then-governor  of portuguese india  menezes also turned out to be incompetent and corrupt  subject to numerous complaints  as a result  john iii decided to appoint vasco da gama himself to replace menezes  confident that the magic of his name and memory of his deeds might better impress his authority on portuguese india  and manage the transition to a new government and new strategy by his appointment letter of february 1524,  john iii granted vasco da gama the privileged title of  viceroy   being only the second portuguese governor to enjoy that title  the first was francisco de almeida in his second son  estêvão da gama was simultaneously appointed capitão-mor  do mar da índia ('captain-major  of the indian sea   commander of the indian ocean naval patrol fleet   to replace duarte s brother  luís de menezes  as a final condition  gama secured from john iii of portugal the commitment to appoint all his sons successively as portuguese captains of malacca setting out in april 1524,  with a fleet of fourteen ships  vasco da gama took as his flagship the famous large carrack santa catarina do monte sinai on her last journey to india  along with two of his sons  estêvão and paulo  after a troubled journey  four or five of the ships were lost en route   he arrived in india in september  vasco da gama immediately invoked his high viceregent powers to impose a new order in portuguese india  replacing all the old officials with his own appointments  but gama contracted malaria not long after arriving  and died in the city of cochin on christmas eve in 1524,  three months after his arrival  as per royal instructions  da gama was succeeded as governor of india by one the captains who had come with him  henrique de menezes  no relation to duarte   vasco s sons estêvão and paulo immediately lost their posts and joined the returning fleet of early 1525   along with the dismissed duarte de menezes and luís de da gama s body was first buried at st  francis church  which was located at fort kochi in the city of kochi  but his remains were returned to portugal in 1539.  the body of vasco da gama was re-interred  in vidigueira in a casket decorated with gold and jewels the monastery of the hieronymites  in belém  which would become the necropolis of the portuguese royal dynasty of aviz  was erected in the early 1500s  near the launch point of vasco da gama s first journey  and its construction funded by a tax on the profits of the yearly portuguese india armadas  in 1880,  da gama s remains and those of the poet luís de camões  who celebrated da gama s first voyage in his 1572  epic poem  the lusiad   were moved to new carved tombs in the nave of the monastery s church  only a few meters away from the tombs of the kings manuel i and john iii  whom da gama had served vasco da gama and his wife  catarina de ataíde  had six sons and one male line issue became extinct in 1747,  though the title went through female line over his numerous years serving the portuguese crown  da gama was rewarded with many different titles  distinctions  and offices vasco da gama is one of the most famous and celebrated explorers from the age of discovery  as much as anyone after henry the navigator  he was responsible for portugal s success as an early colonising power  beside the fact of the first voyage itself  it was his astute mix of politics and war on the other side of the world that placed portugal in a prominent position in indian ocean trade  following da gama s initial voyage  the portuguese crown realized that securing outposts on the eastern coast of africa would prove vital to maintaining national trade routes to the far east however  his fame is tempered by such incidents and attitudes as displayed in the notorious pilgrim ship incident previously discussed the portuguese national epic  the lusíadas of luís vaz de camões  largely concerns vasco da gama s 1865  grand opera l africaine  opéra en cinq actes  composed by giacomo meyerbeer from a libretto by eugène scribe  prominently includes the character of vasco da gama  the events depicted  however  are fictitious  meyerbeer s working title for the opera was vasco da gama  a 1989  production of the opera by the san francisco opera featured noted tenor plácido domingo in the role of da the 19th-century  composer louis-albert  bourgault-ducoudray  composed an eponymous 1872  opera based on da gama s life and exploits at sea the port city of vasco da gama in goa is named after him  as is the crater vasco da gama on the moon  there are three football clubs in brazil  including club de regatas vasco da gama  and vasco sports club in goa that were also named after him  there exists a church in kochi  kerala called vasco da gama church  and a private residence on the island of saint helena  the suburb of vasco in cape town also honours him a few places in lisbon s parque das nações are named after the explorer  such as the vasco da gama bridge  vasco da gama tower and the centro comercial vasco da gama shopping the oceanário in the parque das nações has a mascot of a cartoon diver with the name of  vasco   who is named after the da gama was the only explorer on the final pool of os grandes portugueses  although the final shortlist featured other age of discovery related people  they were not actually explorers nor navigators for any matter the portuguese navy has a class of frigates named after him  there are three vasco da gama class frigates in total  of which the first one also bears his name south african musician hugh masekela recorded an anti-colonialist  song entitled  colonial man   which contains the lyrics  vasco da gama was no friend of mine   and another song entitled  vasco da gama  the sailor man    both songs were included in his 1976  album colonial man vasco da gama appears as an antagonist in the indian film urumi  the film  directed by santosh sivan  depicts a failed assassination attempt on da gama by an indian in march 2016,  archaeologists working off the coast of oman identified a shipwreck believed to be that of the esmeralda from da gama s 1502-1503  fleet  the wreck was initially discovered in 1998.  later underwater excavations took place between 2013  and 2015  through a partnership between the oman ministry of heritage and culture and bluewater recoveries ltd   a shipwreck recovery company  the vessel was identified through such artifacts as a  portuguese coin minted for trade with india  one of only two coins of this type known to exist  and stone cannonballs engraved with what appear to be the initials of vincente sodré  da gama s maternal uncle and the commander of the
