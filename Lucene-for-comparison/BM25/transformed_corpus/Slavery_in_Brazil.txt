 slavery in brazil -  wikipediaslavery in brazil began long before the first portuguese settlement was established in 1532,  as members of one tribe would enslave captured members of later  colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labor during the initial phases of settlement to maintain the subsistence economy  and natives were often captured by expeditions called bandeiras  the importation of african slaves began midway through the 16th  century  but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th  and 18th  centuries during the atlantic slave trade era  brazil imported more african slaves than any other country  an estimated 4.9  million slaves from africa were brought to brazil during the period from 1501  to until the early 1850s,  most enslaved africans who arrived on brazilian shores were forced to embark at west central african ports  especially in luanda (present-day  angola   today  with the exception of nigeria  the largest population of people of african descent is in labor was the driving force behind the growth of the sugar economy in brazil  and sugar was the primary export of the colony from 1600  to 1650.  gold and diamond deposits were discovered in brazil in 1690,  which sparked an increase in the importation of african slaves to power this newly profitable market  transportation systems were developed for the mining infrastructure  and population boomed from immigrants seeking to take part in gold and diamond mining demand for african slaves did not wane after the decline of the mining industry in the second half of the 18th  century  cattle ranching and foodstuff production proliferated after the population growth  both of which relied heavily on slave labor  1.7  million slaves were imported to brazil from africa from 1700  to 1800,  and the rise of coffee in the 1830s  further enticed expansion of the slave trade brazil was the last country in the western world to abolish slavery  by the time it was abolished  in 1888,  an estimated four million slaves had been imported from africa to brazil  40%  of the total number of slaves brought to the americas the portuguese became involved with the african slave trade first during the reconquista   reconquest   of the iberian peninsula mainly through the mediation of the alfaqueque  the person tasked with the rescue of portuguese captives  slaves and prisoners of and then later in 1441,  long before the colonization of brazil  but now as slave traders  slaves exported from africa during this initial period of the portuguese slave trade primarily came from mauritania  and later the upper guinea coast  scholars estimate that as many as 156,000  slaves were exported from 1441  to 1521  to iberia and the atlantic islands from the african coast  the trade made the shift from europe to the americas as a primary destination for slaves around 1518.  prior to this time  slaves were required to pass through portugal to be taxed before making their way to the portuguese first traveled to brazil in 1500  under the expedition of pedro álvares cabral  though the first portuguese settlement was not established until long before europeans came to brazil and began colonization  indigenous groups such as the papanases  the guaianases  the tupinambás  or the cadiueus enslaved captured members of other tribes  the captured lived and worked with their new communities as trophies to the tribe’s martial prowess  some enslaved would eventually escape but could never re-attain  their previous status in their own tribe because of the strong social stigma against slavery and rival tribes  during their time in the new tribe  enslaved indigenous would even marry as a sign of acceptance and servitude  for the enslaved of cannibalistic tribes  execution for devouring purposes  cannibalistic ceremonies  could happen at any moment  while other tribes did not consume human flesh  their enslaved were still put to work  imprisoned  used as hostages  and killed after the arrival of the portuguese in brazil  the native americans started to trade their prisoners  instead of using them as slaves or food  in exchange for goods  but the enslavement of europeans could also occur as happened with hans staden who  after being set free  wrote a book about the habits of the native needed the colonization effort proved to be a difficult undertaking on such a vast continent  and indigenous slave labor was quickly turned to for agricultural workforce needs  aggressive mission networks of the portuguese jesuits were the driving force behind this recruitment  and they successfully mobilized an indigenous labor force to live in colonial villages to work the land  these indigenous enslaving expeditions were known as expeditions were composed of bandeirantes  adventurers who penetrated steadily westward in their search for indian slaves  these adventurers came from a wide spectrum of backgrounds  including plantation owners  traders  members of the military  as well as people of mixed ancestry and previously captured indian in 1629,  antônio raposo tavares led a bandeira  composed of 2,000  allied índios   indians   900  mamelucos   mestizos  and 69  whites  to find precious metals and stones and to capture indians for slavery  this expedition alone was responsible for the enslavement of over 60,000  indigenous slavery became more common in brazil during the mid 16th  century  though the enslavement of indigenous people continued into the 17th  and even the 18th  century in the backlands of brazil  indigenous slaves remained much cheaper during this time than their african counterparts  though they did suffer horrendous death rates from european diseases  although the average african slave lived to only be twenty-three  years old due to terrible work conditions  this was still about four years longer than indigenous slaves  which was a big contribution to high price of african even though prices for indigenous slaves were cheaper  there was never a focus on maintaining slave families  because enslaved peoples were always so available  either through conquest or buying them through the market  the economic incentive to keep families together never manifested was not only endured by native indians or blacks  as the distinction between prisoners of war and slaves was blurred  the enslavement  although at a lesser scale  of captured europeans also took place  the dutch were reported to have sold portuguese  captured in brazil  as and of using african slaves in dutch there are also reports of brazilians enslaved by barbary pirates while crossing the the subsequent centuries  many freed slaves and descendants of slaves became slave eduardo frança paiva estimates that about one third of slave owners were either freed slaves or descendent of confrarias  religious that included slaves  indians and africans  and non slaves were frequently a doorway to freedom  as was the  compadrio   co-godparenthood,  a part of the kinship was the world’s leading sugar exporter during the 17th  century  from 1600  to 1650,  sugar accounted for 95  percent of brazil’s exports  and slave labor was relied heavily upon to provide the workforce to maintain these export earnings  it is estimated that 560,000  central african slaves arrived in brazil during the 17th  century in addition to the indigenous slave labor that was provided by the appearance of slavery in brazil dramatically changed with the discovery of gold and diamond deposits in the mountains of minas gerais in the slaves started being imported from central africa and the mina coast to mining camps in enormous over the next century the population boomed from immigration and rio de janeiro exploded as a global export center  urban slavery in new city centers like rio and salvador also heightened demand for slaves  transportation systems for moving wealth were developed  and cattle ranching and foodstuff production expanded after the decline of the mining industries in the second half of the 18th  century  between 1700  and 1800,  1.7  million slaves were brought to brazil from to make this sweeping growth possible by 1819  the population of brazil was 3.6  million  and at least one third were african slaves  by 1825  the figure may have been as high as in 1826  the first article of a convention drawn in rio de janeiro stated it should not be “lawful for the subjects of the emperor of brazil to be concerned in the carrying on of the african slave trade  under any pretext or in any manner whatever  and the carrying on of such after that period  by any person  subject of his imperial majesty  shall be deemed and treated as the announcement of this treaty caused great excitement in brazil  for many believed it meant immediate suspension of the slave trade  however  when coffee production exploded in the 1830s  in rio de janeiro as the crop that would fuel the export economy for the next 140  years  this new demand on the trade was not quelled by the the british forcibly halted the trade with africa by the 1850s,  and the country then became dependent on an internal slave labor force as well as spanish and italian immigrant nonetheless  despite laws banning their importation  between 1808  and 1888  more than a million new slaves were forcibly shipped to slaves who were freed and returned to africa  the agudás  continued to be seen as slaves by the african indigenous population  as they had left africa as slaves  when they returned although now as free people  they were not accepted in the local society who saw them as in africa they also took part in the slave trade now as slave were relatively few large revolts in brazil for much of the 16th,  17th,  and 18th  centuries  most likely because running away into the expansive interior presented an attractive alternative to the dangers of in the years after the haitian revolution  ideals of liberty and freedom had spread to even brazil  in rio de janeiro in 1805,   soldiers of african descent wore medallion portraits of the emperor dessalines   jean-jacques  dessalines was one of the african leaders of the haitian revolution that inspired blacks throughout the world to fight for their rights as humans to live and die free  after the defeat of the french in haiti  demand for sugar continued to increase and without the consistent production of sugar in haiti the world turned to brazil as the next largest exporter african slaves continued to be imported and were concentrated in the northeastern region of bahia  a region infamous for cruel  yet prolific  sugar plantations  african slaves recently brought to brazil were less likely to accept their condition and eventually were able to create coalitions with the purpose of overthrowing their masters  from 1807  to 1835,  these groups instigated numerous slave revolts in bahia with a violence and terror that were previously one notable instance  enslaved people who revolted and ran away from the engenho santana in bahia sent their former plantation owner a peace proposal outlining the terms under which they would return to the enslaved people wanted peace and did not want war  they came up with a proposal that would serve as a peace offering among their master and all of his enslaved people  the terms were outlined as such  enslaved people are to be given fridays and saturdays to work for themselves and these two days are not to be subtracted or counted as saint s days  furthermore  they must be given casting nets and canoes for survival  slaves are also not obliged to fish in tidal pools or gather shellfish and if the master wishes to eat shellfish  the slaves asked to send your mina blacks  the proposal also stated the request of making a large boat so that when it goes to bahia  the slaves can place their cargoes aboard and not pay freightage of carrying the goods in bulks  in addition  in the planting of manioc  they requested that the men to have a daily quota of two and a half hands and for the women  two hands  for manioc four  the daily quota must be five level alqueires or also equivalent to 36.27  litres in dry measure  the daily quota for sugarcane was set to five hands rather than six and with ten canes in each bundle  next  on the boats it was stated that there are to be four poles  and one pole for the rudder to steer the ship  and the one at the rudder must work hard for the slaves  upon that request  the wood that is sawed using a hand saw must have three men below and one men above  the following on the list was that the measure of firewood had to be practiced here  and for each measure a woodcutter and a woman had to be the wood carrier  the peace proposal also stated that they did not want the present oversees and to choose new ones with the approval of the slaves first  in the proposal  it was also written that at the milling rollers there has to be four women to feed in the cane  two pulleys  and a carcanha  also  at each cauldron or pot there must be a person to tend the fire and this also must apply to each series of kettles  on saturdays  there must be no work at all in the mill without fail  on top of that  sailors that go in the launch beside the baize shirt  must be provided with a jacket baize and with all other necessary clothing  the slaves agreed to go and work the canefield of jabirú but it must remain as a pasture as they would not cut cane in the swamp  the terms also pointed out that the slaves are to be allowed to plant rice wherever they want and in any marsh  without needing to ask permission  each slave is also allowed to cut jacaranda or any other wood without having to be accounted for it  the proposal concluded with saying that by accepting all the terms stated in the proposal and always allowing the slaves to possess the hardware  they would be ready to serve the master just as they did before but they do not want to continue living the bad customs like how it was in the other engenhos or known as sugar cane mills and facilities  their last request was that they are to be able to play  relax and sing at any time they wished to do so without being hindered and that asking permission was not needed to do any of that  largest and most significant of these uprisings occurred in 1835  in salvador  called the muslim uprising of 1835.  it was planned by an african-born  muslim ethnic group of slaves  the malês  as a revolt that would free all of the slaves in bahia  while organized by the malês  all of the african ethnic groups were represented in the participants  both muslim and however  there is a conspicuous absence of brazilian-born  slaves who participated in the rebellion  an estimated 300  rebels were arrested  of which nearly 250  were african slaves and brazilian-born  slaves and ex-slaves  represented 40%  of the population of bahia  but a total of two mulattoes and three brazilian-born  blacks were arrested during the what s more  the uprising was efficiently quelled by mulatto troops by the day after its instigation the fact that africans were not joined in the 1835  revolt by mulattoes was far from unusual  in fact  no brazilian blacks had participated in the 20  previous revolts in bahia during that time period  masters played a large role in creating tense relations between africans and afro-brazilians,  for they generally favored mulattoes and native brazilian slaves  who consequently experienced better manumission rates  masters were aware of the importance of tension between groups to maintain the repressive status quo  as stated by luis dos santos vilhema  circa 1798,      if african slaves are treacherous  and mulattoes are even more so  and if not for the rivalry between the former and the latter  all the political power and social order would crumble before a servile revolt     the master class was able to put mulatto troops to use controlling slaves with little backlash  thus  the freed black and mulatto population was considered as much an enemy to slaves as the white only was a unified rebellion effort against the oppressive regime of slavery prevented in bahia by the tensions between africans and brazilian-born  african descendants  but ethnic tensions within the african-born  slave population itself prevented formation of a common slave slaves formed communities which played an important role in the histories of other countries such as suriname  puerto rico  cuba  and jamaica  in brazil the maroon villages were called quilombos and the most famous was quilombo dos palmares  here escaped slaves  army deserters  mulattos  and indigenous flocked to participate in this underground society  quilombos reflected the people’s will and soon the governing and social bodies of palamares mirrored central african political models  from 1605  to 1694  palmares grew and attracted thousands from across brazil  though palmares was eventually defeated and its inhabitants dispersed among the country  the formative period allowed for continuation of african traditions and helped create a distinct african culture in achieved independence from portugal in 1822.  however  the complete collapse of colonial government took place from josé bonifácio de andrade e silva is credited as the  father of brazilian independence   around 1822,  representação to the constituent assembly was published arguing for an end to the slave trade and for the gradual emancipation of existing 1877–78  grande seca  great drought  in the cotton-growing  northeast led to major turmoil  starvation  poverty and internal migration  as wealthy plantation holders rushed to sell their slaves in the south  popular resistance and resentment grew  inspiring numerous emancipation societies  they succeeded in banning slavery altogether in the province of ceará by debret  a french painter who was active in brazil in the first decades of the 19th  century  started out by painting portraits of members of the brazilian imperial family  but soon became concerned with the slavery of both blacks and the indigenous inhabitants  during the fifteen years debret spent in brazil  he concentrated not only on court rituals but the everyday life of slaves as well  his paintings  one of which appears on this page  helped draw attention to the subject in both europe and brazil itself the clapham sect  although their religious and political influence was more active in spanish latin america  were a group of evangelical reformers that campaigned during much of the 19th  century for the united kingdom to use its influence and power to stop the traffic of slaves to brazil  besides moral qualms  the low cost of slave-produced  brazilian sugar meant that british colonies in the west indies were unable to match the market prices of brazilian sugar  and each briton was consuming 16  pounds (7  kg  of sugar a year by the 19th  century  this combination led to intensive pressure from the british government for brazil to end this practice  which it did by steps over three 1872,  the population of brazil was 10  million  and 15%  were slaves  as a result of widespread manumission  easier in brazil than in north america   by this time approximately three quarters of blacks and mulattoes in brazil were slavery was not legally ended nationwide until 1888  by the lei áurea   golden act    a legal act promulgated on may 13  by isabel  princess imperial of brazil  in fact  it was an institution in decline by this time  since the 1880s  the country began to attract european immigrant labor instead   brazil was the last nation in the western world to abolish slavery  and by abolition had imported an estimated total of four million slaves from africa  this was 40%  of all slaves shipped to the colonial brazil  identity became a complex combination of race  skin color  and socioeconomic status because of the extensive diversity of both the slave and free population  for example  in 1872  43%  of the population was free mulattoes and blacks  there are four broad categories that show the general divisions among the identities of the slave and ex-slave  populations  african-born  slaves  african-born  ex-slaves,  brazilian-born  slaves  and brazilian-born  ex-slaves.a  slave’s identity was stripped when sold into the slave trade  and they were assigned a new identity that was to be immediately adopted in stride  this new identity often came in the form of a new name  created by a christian or portuguese first name randomly issued by the baptizing priest  and followed by the label of an african nation  in brazil  these  labels  were predominantly angola  congo  yoruba  ashanti  rebolo  anjico  gabon  and often these names served as a way for europeans to divide africans in a familiar manner  disregarding ethnicity or origin  anthropologist jack goody stated   such new names served to cut the individuals off from their kinfolk  their society  from humanity itself and at the same time emphasized their servile critical part of the initiation of any sort of collective identity for african-born  slaves began with relationships formed on slave ships crossing the middle passage  shipmates called each other malungos  and this relationship was considered as important and valuable as the relationship with their wives and children  malungos were often ethnically related as well  for slaves shipped on the same boat were usually from similar geographical regions of of the most important markers of the freedom of a slave was the adoption of a last name upon being freed  these names would often be the family names of their ex-owners,  either in part or in full  since many slaves had the same or similar christian name assigned from their baptism  it was common for a slave to be called both their portuguese or christian name as well as the name of their master   maria  for example  became known as sr  santana s maria   thus  it was mostly a matter of convenience when a slave was freed for him or her to adopt the surname of their ex-owner  for assimilation into the community as a free freedom was not a guarantee of escape from poverty or from many aspects of slave life  frequently legal freedom did not come with a change in occupation for the ex-slave.  however  there was increased opportunity for both sexes to become involved in wage earning  women ex-slaves  largely dominated market places selling food and goods in urban areas like salvador  while a significant percent of african-born  men freed from slavery became employed as skilled artisans  including work as sculptors  carpenters  and area of income important to african-born  ex-slaves  was their own work as slavers upon being granted their freedom  in fact  purchase of slaves was a standard practice for ex-slaves  who could afford it  this is evidence of the lack of a common identity among those born in africa and shipped to brazil  for it was much more common for ex-slaves  to engage in the slave trade themselves than to take up any cause related to abolition or resistance to brazilian-born  slave was born into slavery  meaning their identity was based on very different factors than those of the african-born  who had once known legal freedom  skin color was a significant factor in determining the status of african descendants born in brazil  lighter-skinned  slaves had both higher chances of manumission as well as better social mobility if they were granted freedom  making it important in the identity of both brazilian-born  slaves and term crioulo was primarily used in the early 19th  century  and meant brazilian-born  and black  mulatto was used to refer to lighter-skinned  brazilian-born  africans  who often were children of both african and european descent  as compared to their african-born  counterparts  manumission for long-term  good behavior or obedience upon the owner’s death was much more likely  thus  unpaid manumission was a much more likely path to freedom for brazilian-born  slaves than for africans  as well as manumission in mulattoes also had a higher incidence of manumission  most likely because of the likelihood that they were the children of a slave and an color divides reinforced racial barriers between african and brazilian slaves  and often created animosity between them  these differences were heightened after freedom was granted  for lighter skin correlated with social mobility and the greater chance an ex-slave  could distance him-  or herself from their former slave life  thus  mulattoes and lighter-skinned  ex-slaves  had larger opportunity to improve their socioeconomic status within the confines of the colonial brazilian social structure  as a consequence  self-segregation  was common  as mulattoes preferred to separate their identity as much as possible from blacks  one way this is visible is from data on church marriages during the 19th  century  church marriage was an expensive affair  and one only the more successful ex-slaves  were able to afford  and these marriages were also almost always endogamous  the fact that skin color largely dictated possible partners in marriage promoted racial distinctions as well  interracial marriage was a rarity  and was almost always a case of a union between a white man and a mulatto invisibility of women in brazilian slavery as well as in slavery in general has only been recently recognized as an important void in history  historian mary helen washington wrote   the life of the male slave has come to be representative even though the female experience in slavery was sometimes radically in brazil  the sectors of slavery and wage-labor  for ex-slaves  were indeed distinct by gender labor performed by both slave and freed women was largely divided between domestic work and the market scene  which was much larger in urban cities like salvador and rio de janeiro  the domestic work women performed for owners was traditional  consisting of cooking  cleaning  laundry  fetching water  and childcare  in the 1870s,  87–90%  of slave women in rio worked as domestic servants  and an estimated 34,000  slave and free women labored as domestics  thus  brazilian women in urban centers often blurred the lines that separated the work and lives of the slave and the urban settings  african slave markets provided an additional source of income for both slave and ex-slave  women  who typically monopolized sales  this trend of the marketplace being predominantly the realm of women has its origins in african customs  wilhelm muller  a german minister  observed in his travels to the gold coast   apart from the peasants who bring palm-wine  and sugarcane to the market everyday  there are no men who stand in public markets to trade  only the women sold tropical fruits and vegetables  cooked african dishes  candies  cakes  meat  and owners would buy mina and angolan women and girls to work as cooks  household servants and street vendors quitamdeiras  the women who worked as quitamdeiras would acquire gold through the exchange of prepared food and aguardente  also known as sugarcane rum   slave owners would then keep a day s wage of one pataca  and the quitamdeiras were then expected to buy their own food and rum  thus causing the enslaved women and their owners to become enriched  with access to gold or to gold dust  the quitamdeiras were able to purchase the freedom of their children s and their own  was almost exclusively a trade performed by slave women  many of whom were forced into it to benefit their owners socially and financially  slave women were also used by freed men as concubines or common-law  wives and often worked for them in addition as household labor  wet nurses  cooks  and women on plantations were often given the same work as men  slaveholders often put slave women to work alongside men in the grueling atmosphere of the fields but were aware of ways to exploit them with regards to their gender as well  choosing between the two was regularly a matter of expediency for the in both small and large estates women were heavily involved in fieldwork  and the chance to be exempted in favor of domestic work was a privilege  their roles in reproduction were still emphasized by owners  but often childbirth only meant that the physical demands of the field were forced to coexist with the emotional and physical pull of dual-sphere  nature of women’s work  in household domestic labor  and in the marketplace  allowed for both additional opportunities at financial resources as well as a larger social circle than their male counterparts  this gave women greater resources both as slaves and as ex-slaves,  though their mobility was hindered by gender constraints  however  women often fared better in manumission possibilities  among brazilian-born  adult ex-slaves  in salvador in the 18th  century  60%  were are many reasons that could explain why women were disproportionately represented in manumitted brazilian slaves  women who worked in the home were able to form more intimate relationships with the owner and the family  increasing their chances of unpaid manumission for reasons of  good behavior  or additionally  male slaves were economically seen as more useful especially by landowners  making their manumission more costly to the owner and therefore for the slave himself the work of male slaves was a much more formal affair  especially in urban settings as compared to the experience of slave women  often  male work groups were divided by ethnicity to work as porters and transporters in gangs  transporting furniture and agricultural products by water or from ships to the marketplace  it was also the role of slave men to bring new slaves from ships to auction  men also were used as fishermen  canoeists  oarsmen  sailors  and artisans  up to one-fourth  of slaves from 1811–1888  were employed as artisans  and many were men who worked as carpenters  painters  sculptors  and also did certain kinds of domestic work in cities like rio and salvador  including starching  ironing  fetching water  and dumping on plantations outside of urban areas however  men were primarily involved in fieldwork with women  their roles on larger estates also included working in boiling houses and tending 1995,  288  farmworkers were freed from what was officially described as a contemporary forced labor situation  this number eventually rose to 583  in 2000.  in 2001,  however  the brazilian government freed more than 1,400  slave laborers from many different forced labor institutions varying throughout the country  the majority of forced labor  whether coerced through debt  violence  or through another manner  is often unreported  the danger that these individuals face in their day-to-day  life often make it extremely difficult to turn to authorities and report what is going on  a national survey conducted in 2000  by the pastoral land commission  a roman catholic church group  estimated that there were more than 25,000  forced workers and slaves in in 2007,  in an admission to the united nations  the brazilian government declared that at least 25,000–40,000  brazilians work under work conditions  analogous to slavery   the top anti-slavery  official in brasília  brazil s capital  estimates the number of modern enslaved at year it seems as new evidence is found that modern slavery is occurring  in 2007,  the brazilian government freed more than 1,000  forced laborers from a sugar in 2008,  the brazilian government freed 4,634  slaves in 133  separate criminal cases at 255  different locations  freed slaves received a total compensation of £2.4  million  equal to $4.8  though they received monetary compensation for their government s inability to protect them  the emotional cost for former enslaved will forever remain with the individual in march 2012,  european consumer protection organizations published a study about slavery and cruelty to animals involved when producing leather shoes  a danish organization was contracted to visit farms  slaughterhouses and tanneries in brazil and india  the conditions of humans found were catastrophic  as well the treatment of the animals was found cruel  none of the 16  companies surveyed were able to track the used products down to the final producers  timberland did not participate  but was found the winner as it showed at least some signs of transparency on its in 2013,  the u s  department of labor s findings on the worst forms of child labor in brazil reported that children in this country are mostly  engaged in child labor in agriculture and domestic 2014,  the bureau of international labor affairs issued a list of goods produced by child labor or forced labor where brazil was classified as one of the 74  countries still involved in child labor and forced labor yearly celebration that allows insight into race relations  carnival is a weeklong festival celebrated all around the world  in brazil it is associated with numerous facets of brazilian culture  soccer  samba  music  performances  and costumes  the brazilian carnival is unlike any other national festival in the world  schools are on holiday  workers have the week off  and a general sense of jubilee fills the streets  where musicians parade around to huge crowds of cheering was during brazil’s military dictatorship  defined by many as brazil’s darkest period  when a group called ilê aiyê came together to protest black exclusion within the majority black state of bahia  there had been a series of protests at the beginning of the 1970s  that raised awareness for back unification but they were met with severe suppression  prior to 1974,  afro-bahians  would leave their houses with only religious figurines to celebrate carnival  though under increased scrutiny attributed to the military dictatorship  ilê aiyê succeeded in created a black only bloco  carnaval parade group  that manifested the ideals of the brazilian black their purpose was to unite the afro-brazilians  affected by the oppressive government and politically organize so that there could be lasting change among their community ilê aiyê s success has continued ever since and their numbers have grown into the thousands  even today  the black only bloco continues to exclude others because of their skin color  they do this by advertising exclusive parties and benefits for members  as well as physically shunning and pushing you away if you try to include yourself  though the media has called it ‘racist’  to a large degree the black-only  bloco has become one of the most interesting aspects of salvador’s carnaval and is continuously accepted as a way of life  combined with the influence of in salvador  musical protest and representation as a product of slavery and black consciousness has slowly grown into a more powerful force  musical representation of problems and issues have long been part of brazil s history  and ilê aiyê and olodum both produce creative ways to remain relevant and popular slavery as an institution in brazil was unrivaled in all of the americas  the sheer number of african slaves brought to brazil and moved around south america greatly influenced the entirety of the americas  indigenous groups  portuguese colonists  and african slaves all contributed to the melting pot that has created brazil  the mixture of african religions that survived throughout slavery and catholicism  candomblé  has created some of the most interesting and diverse cultural aspects  in bahia  statues of african gods called orishas pay homage to the unique african presence in the nation’s largest afro-brazilian  not only are these orishas direct links to their past ancestry  but also reminders to the cultures the brazilian people come from  condomblé and the orishas serve as an ever-present  reminder that african slaves were brought to brazil  though their lives were different in brazil  their culture has been preserved at least to some degree since the 1990s,  despite the increasing public attention given to slavery through national and international initiatives like unesco’s slave route project  brazil has mounted very few initiatives commemorating and memorializing slavery and the atlantic slave trade  however  in the last decade brazil has begun engaging in several initiatives underscoring its slave past and the importance of african heritage  gradually  all over the country statues celebrating zumbi  the leader of palmares  brazilian long-lasting  quilombo  runaway slave community  were unveiled  capital cities like rio de janeiro and even porto alegre created permanent markers commemorating heritage sites of slavery and the atlantic slave trade  among the most recent and probably the most famous initiatives of this kind is the valong wharf slave memorial in rio de janeiro  the site where almost one million enslaved africans and systematic inequality and disadvantage still exist within brazil  though much progress has been made since abolition  unequal representation in all levels of society perpetuates ongoing racial prejudice  most obvious are the stark contrasts between white and black brazilians in media  government  and private business  brazil continues to grow and succeed economically  yet its poorest regions and neighborhood slums  favelas   occupied by majority
