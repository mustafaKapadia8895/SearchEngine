 iapetus ocean -  wikipediathe iapetus was an ocean that existed in the late neoproterozoic and early paleozoic eras of the geologic timescale  between 600  and 400  million years ago   the iapetus ocean was situated in the southern hemisphere  between the paleocontinents of laurentia  baltica and avalonia  the ocean disappeared with the acadian  caledonian and taconic orogenies  when these three continents joined to form one big landmass called euramerica  the  southern  iapetus ocean has been proposed to have closed with the famatinian and taconic orogenies  meaning a collision between western gondwana and laurentia because the iapetus ocean was positioned between continental masses that would at a much later time roughly form the opposite shores of the atlantic ocean  it can be seen as a sort of precursor of the atlantic  the iapetus ocean was therefore named for the titan iapetus  who in greek mythology was the father of atlas  after whom the atlantic ocean was the start of the 20th  century  american paleontologist charles walcott noticed differences in early paleozoic benthic trilobites of laurentia  such as olenellidae  the so-called   pacific fauna    as found in scotland and western newfoundland and those of baltica  such as paradoxididae  often called the  atlantic fauna    as found in the southern parts of the british isles and eastern newfoundland  geologists of the early 20th  century presumed that a large trough  a so-called  geosyncline  had existed between scotland and england in the early paleozoic  keeping both sides the development of plate tectonics in the 1960s,  geologists such as arthur holmes and john tuzo wilson concluded that the atlantic ocean must have had a precursor before the time of pangaea  wilson also noticed that the atlantic had opened at roughly the same place where its precursor ocean had closed  this led him to his wilson cycle many spots in scandinavia basaltic dikes are found with ages between 670  and 650  million years  these are interpreted as evidence that by that time  rifting had started that would form the iapetus in newfoundland and labrador  the long range dikes are also thought to have formed during the formation of the iapetus it has been proposed that both the fen complex in norway and the alnö complex in sweden formed as consequence to mild extensional tectonics in the ancient continent of baltica that followed the opening of the iapetus southern iapetus ocean opened between laurentia and southwestern gondwana  now south america  about 550  ma in the ediacaran–cambrian transition  at the time it did so the adamastor ocean further east the opening of the iapetus ocean probably postdates the opening of the puncoviscana ocean with the iapetus ocean being separated from the puncoviscana ocean by the ribbon-shaped  arequipa-antofalla  terrane  however  the formation of both oceans seems of the iapetus  a volcanic island arc evolved from the early cambrian (540  million years ago  onward  this volcanic arc was formed above a subduction zone where the oceanic lithosphere of the iapetus ocean subducted southward under other oceanic lithosphere  from cambrian times  about 550  million years ago  the western iapetus ocean began to grow progressively narrower due to this subduction  the same happened further north and east  where avalonia and baltica began to move towards laurentia from the ordovician (488-444  million years ago  faunas of the continental shelves of baltica and laurentia are still very different in the ordovician  but silurian faunas show progressive mixing of species from both sides  because the continents moved closer the west  the iapetus ocean closed with the taconic orogeny (480-430  million years ago   when the volcanic island arc collided with laurentia  some authors consider the oceanic basin south of the island arc also a part of the iapetus  this branch closed during the later acadian orogeny  when avalonia collided with needed it has been suggested that the southern iapetus ocean closed during a continental collision between laurentia and western gondwana  south america   if factual the taconic orogen would be the northward continuation of the famatinian orogen exposed in the eastern parts had closed too  the tornquist sea between avalonia and baltica already during the late the main branch between baltica-avalonia  and laurentia during the grampian and scandian phases of the caledonian orogeny (440-420  million years needed at the end of the silurian period  c  420  million years ago  the iapetus ocean had completely disappeared and the combined mass of the three continents formed the  new  continent of which would itself be the northern component of the singular supercontinent of needed
