 north american plate -  wikipediathe north american plate is a tectonic plate covering most of north america  greenland  cuba  the bahamas  extreme northeastern asia  and parts of iceland and the azores  it extends eastward to the mid-atlantic  ridge and westward to the chersky range in eastern siberia  the plate includes both continental and oceanic crust  the interior of the main continental landmass includes an extensive granitic core called a craton  along most of the edges of this craton are fragments of crustal material called terranes  accreted to the craton by tectonic actions over the long span of geologic time  it is thought that much of north america west of the rocky mountains is composed of such terranes the southerly boundary with the cocos plate to the west and the caribbean plate to the east is a transform fault  represented by the cayman trench under the caribbean sea and the motagua fault through guatemala  the parallel septentrional and enriquillo-plantain  garden faults  which run through the island of hispaniola and bound the gonâve microplate  are also a part of the boundary  the rest of the southerly margin which extends east to the mid atlantic ridge and marks the boundary between the north american plate and the south american plate is vague but located near the fifteen-twenty  fracture zone around 16°n.on  the northerly boundary is a continuation of the mid-atlantic  ridge called the gakkel ridge  the rest of the boundary in the far northwestern part of the plate extends into siberia  this boundary continues from the end of the gakkel ridge as the laptev sea rift  on to a transitional deformation zone in the chersky range  then the ulakhan fault between it and the okhotsk plate  and finally the aleutian trench to the end of the queen charlotte fault system the westerly boundary is the queen charlotte fault running offshore along the coast of alaska and the cascadia subduction zone to the north  the san andreas fault through california  the east pacific rise in the gulf of california  and the middle america trench to the south on its western edge  the farallon plate has been subducting under the north american plate since the jurassic period  the farallon plate has almost completely subducted beneath the western portion of the north american plate leaving that part of the north american plate in contact with the pacific plate as the san andreas fault  the juan de fuca  explorer  gorda  rivera  cocos and nazca plates are remnants of the farallon plate the boundary along the gulf of california is complex  the gulf is underlain by the gulf of california rift zone  a series of rift basins and transform fault segments between the northern end of the east pacific rise in the mouth of the gulf to the san andreas fault system in the vicinity of the salton trough rift brawley seismic is generally accepted that a piece of the north american plate was broken off and transported north as the east pacific rise propagated northward  creating the gulf of california  however  it is as yet unclear whether the oceanic crust east of the rise and west of the mainland coast of mexico is actually a new plate beginning to converge with the north american plate  consistent with the standard model of rift zone spreading centers needed a few hotspots are thought to exist below the north american plate  the most notable hotspots are the yellowstone  wyoming   raton  new mexico   and anahim  british columbia  hotspots  these are thought to be caused by a narrow stream of hot mantle convecting up from the earth s core-mantle  boundary called a mantle although some geologists think that upper-mantle  convection is a more likely the yellowstone and anahim hotspots are thought to have first arrived during the miocene period and are still geologically active  creating earthquakes and volcanoes  the yellowstone hotspot is most notable for the yellowstone caldera and the many calderas that lie in the snake river plain while the anahim hotspot is most notable for the anahim volcanic belt  currently found in the nazko cone area for the most part  the north american plate moves in roughly a southwest direction away from the mid-atlantic  ridge the motion of the plate cannot be driven by subduction as no part of the north american plate is being subducted  except for a small section comprising part of the puerto rico trench  thus other mechanisms continue to be investigated one recent study suggests that a mantle convective current is propelling the
