 eocene–oligocene extinction event -  wikipediathe transition between the end of the eocene and the beginning of the oligocene is marked by large-scale  extinction and floral and faunal turnover  although minor in comparison to the largest mass most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature  they included the last of the ancient cetaceans  the archaeoceti this was a time of major climatic change  especially cooling  not obviously linked with any single major impact or any catastrophic volcanic one cause of the extinction event is speculated to be extended volcanic activity  another speculation is that the extinctions are related to several large meteorite impacts that occurred about this time  one such event caused the chesapeake bay impact crater (40  km   and another at the popigai crater (100  km  of central siberia  scattering debris perhaps as far as europe  new dating of the popigai meteor suggests it may be a cause of the mass leading scientific theory on climate cooling at this time is decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide  which slowly declined in the mid to late eocene and possibly reached some threshold approximately 34  million years ago  this boundary is closely linked with the oligocene oi-1  event  an oxygen isotope excursion that marks the beginning of ice sheet coverage on grande coupure  or  great break  in with a major european turnover in mammalian fauna about 33.5  ma  marks the end of the last phase of eocene assemblages  the priabonian  and the arrival in europe of asian species  the grande coupure is characterized by widespread extinctions and allopatric speciation in small isolated relict it was given its name in 1910  by the swiss palaeontologist hans georg to characterise the dramatic turnover of european mammalian fauna  which he placed at the eocene-oligocene  boundary  a comparable turnover in asian fauna has since been called the  mongolian remodelling  the grande coupure marks a break between endemic european faunas before the break and mixed faunas with a strong asian component afterwards  j  j  hooker and his team summarized the has been suggested that this was caused by climate change associated with the earliest polar and a major fall in sea levels  or by competition with taxa dispersing from asia  however  few argue for an isolated single cause  other possible causes are related to the impact of one or more large bolides in northern hemisphere at popigai  toms canyon and chesapeake bay  improved correlation of northwest european successions to global confirms the grande coupure as occurring in the earliest oligocene  with a hiatus of about 350  millennia prior to the first record of post-grande  coupure asian immigrant taxa an element of the paradigm of the grande coupure was the apparent extinction of all european primates at the coupure  the recent of a mouse-sized  early oligocene omomyid  reflecting the better survival chances of small mammals  further undercut the grand coupure paradigm evidence in the world’s ocean current system indicates an abrupt cooling from 34.1  to 33.6  ma across the eocene–oligocene boundary at 33.9  ma  the remarkable cooling period in the ocean is correlated with pronounced mammalian faunal replacement within continental asia as well  the asian biotic reorganization events are comparable to the grande coupure in europe and the mongolian remodeling of mammalian the global cooling is also correlated with marked drying conditions in low-latitudes
