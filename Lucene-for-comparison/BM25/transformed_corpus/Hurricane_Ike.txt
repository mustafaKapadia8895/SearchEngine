 hurricane ike -  wikipediahurricane ike  pronounced  ˈaɪk   was a powerful tropical cyclone that swept through portions of the greater antilles and northern america in september 2008,  wreaking havoc on infrastructure and agriculture  particularly in cuba and texas  other locations were also seriously affected by ike  which was ultimately the fourth-costliest  of any atlantic hurricane and resulted in $37.5  billion in damages  with only hurricanes sandy (2012),  katrina (2005)  and harvey (2017)  estimated higher ike developed from a tropical wave west of cape verde on september 1]  and strengthened to a peak intensity as a category 4  hurricane over the open waters of the central atlantic on september 4  as it tracked westward  several fluctuations in strength occurred before ike made landfall on eastern cuba on september 8.  the hurricane weakened prior to continuing into the gulf of mexico  but increased its intensity by the time of its final landfall on galveston  texas on september 13.  the remnants of ike continued to track across the united states and into canada  causing considerable damage inland  before dissipating two days later ike was blamed for at least 195  deaths  of these deaths  74  were in haiti  which was already trying to recover from the impact of three storms  fay  gustav  and hanna  which had made landfall that same year  seven people were killed in cuba by in the united states  113  people were reported killed  directly or indirectly  and 16  were still missing as of august due to its immense size  ike caused devastation from the louisiana coastline all the way to the kenedy county region near corpus christi  in addition  ike caused flooding and significant damage along the mississippi coastline and the florida damages from ike in u s  coastal and inland areas are estimated at $29.5  billion (2008  with additional damage of $7.3  billion in cuba  the costliest storm ever in that country   $200  million in the bahamas  and $500  million in the turks and caicos  amounting to a total of at least $37.5  billion in damage  ike is currently the third-costliest  atlantic hurricane of all time  only surpassed by hurricane katrina in 2005,  and later by hurricane sandy in though initial cost estimates for hurricanes and indicate both will surpass ike  the search-and-rescue  operation after ike is the largest search-and-rescue  operation in texas was the third major hurricane of the 2008  atlantic hurricane origins of hurricane ike can be traced back to a well-defined  tropical wave first identified by the national hurricane center  nhc  just within the western coast of africa on august despite the development of a low-pressure  area associated with the wave and signs of organization within favorable conditions near the cape verde the system was only able to generate intermittent thunderstorm activity  the broad low-pressure  continued to track westward and was considered to have become sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression at 06:00  utc on september 1.  by this time the cyclone had tracked 780  miles (1,260  kilometers  west of cape verde  although post-analysis  indicated that the depression reached tropical storm strength at 12:00  utc that operationally the nhc began issuing advisories on ike three hours later  by which time the system had already gained numerous curved rainbands and well-established  over the next few hours  ike developed additional but failed to a centralized area of convection due to the presence of dry air to the storm s south and its location in an area with only marginally favorable sea surface these factors were also responsible for ike s slow developmental trend that began after gradual strengthening began to quicken early on september 3,  with the strengthening of an intense rainband around the center of the storm  at roughly 15:00  utc that day  microwave imaging indicated that a primordial eye was developing within the intensifying tropical tracking northwestward  the nhc upgraded ike to hurricane status at 18:00  utc based on objective satellite intensity estimates and the appearance of the eye on visible satellite during this time  ike was centered 690  mi (1,110  km  east-northeast  of the leeward islands and was tracking west-northwestward  as a result of a weakened subtropical ridge to its ike s placement in an area with virtually no wind shear allowed for the hurricane to undergo explosive intensification despite unfavorable upper-level  winds to its reaching major hurricane strength six hours after its designation as a at 06:00  utc on september 4,  ike peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145  miles per hour (233  kilometers per hour  and a minimum barometric pressure of 935  millibars (27.6  inches of mercury   making the storm a category 4  on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale  after peaking in strength  a ridge of high pressure to the storm s west strengthened  causing ike to track towards the southwest—a path unusual for the time of year  however  this track also brought the storm into an area of strong wind causing the storm to become asymmetric in structure late on september 4  and briefly dropping below major hurricane status on september 6  while 150  miles (240  km  east of grand turk although wind shear abated and allowed for reintensification  ike would fluctuate in strength over the next few days  after passing near the turks and caicos islands  ike made its first landfall on inagua in the bahamas at 13:00  utc on september 7  with winds of 125  mph (201  passing over the development of a double eyewall—a feature that usually denotes the beginning of an eyewall replacement cycle—slightly weakened ike late on september however  the hurricane was able to reintensify and reach category 4  intensity for a final time before making landfall near cabo lucrecia on the coast of holguín province in cuba by 00:00  utc the next although ike remained well-defined  for most of its crossing of eastern the hurricane s core had become disrupted by the time it had reached the caribbean sea after spending a few hours over over the next day  ike tracked westward  paralleling the southern coast of cuba without much intensification  at times the center of the hurricane was within 12  mi (19  km  of the island  at around 14:00  utc on september 9,  ike made a second cuban landfall  this time on punta la capitana in pinar del rio  with winds of 80  mph (130  km h   roughly six hours later  the hurricane emerged into the gulf of mexico as a slightly weakened tracking back over water  ike s prolonged interaction with cuba had greatly disrupted the system s core  and instead of quickly strengthening and coalescing  the storm s wind field instead grew and only gradual intensification due to the storm s comparatively small inner core and intensity of the outer an eyewall replacement cycle took place  preventing ike from rapidly intensifying  at around the same time  a high-pressure  area strengthened to the hurricane s north  steering the cyclone further west than initially anticipated  moving over the warm waters of the loop ike reached a secondary minimum in barometric pressure on 00:00  utc with an estimate of 944  mbar (27.9  inhg   though winds would continue to strengthen afterward  the storm s pressure would by late on september 12,  ike had reached the western edge of the nearby high-pressure  area and began to curve northward  the formation of an eye just prior to landfall resulted in a slight increase in and at 0700  utc on september 13,  ike made landfall on the northeast end of galveston island in texas  with a minimum barometric pressure of 950  mbar (28  inhg  and sustained winds of 110  mph (180  km h   making ike a category 2  after tracking inland  ike weakened as it sped northward and later northeastward  weakening to tropical storm status east of palestine  texas late on september 13  and later becoming a powerful extratropical cyclone on september 14  over the a more steady weakening phase ensued  and after tracking across southern ontario and quebec  the remnants of ike were absorbed by another extratropical low near the st  lawrence river  on september a repeat of hurricane donna in 1960,  the overseas branch of the british red cross began preparing contingency plans for 2,000  families considered to be at risk from ike  a group of 260  chinese construction workers stuck on middle caicos after the passage of hurricane hanna were evacuated by the british red immediately before the storm struck  348  people on grand turk were put into emergency september 5,  florida governor charlie crist declared a state of emergency in advance of ike s arrival   which was expected to be as early as september 8).  authorities in key west issued a mandatory evacuation for all visitors for september 6.  the federal emergency management agency  fema  positioned supplies  and emergency response crews in florida and along the gulf coast florida keys officials began evacuations on the low-lying  chain of islands in phases  starting at the end in key west by 8  am sunday and continuing throughout the day—at noon for the middle keys  and at 4  pm for the upper keys  including key largo  visitors were told to leave on overall 15,000  tourists evacuated  but the storm stayed to the south  only causing minor beach september 7,  the texas water wastewater agency response network activated its 700-member  utility mutual aid network and began coordination with the state emergency operations center and the texas commission on environmental quality  tceq  to begin preparations and notifications to utilities to prepare for state rural water associations activated mutual aid networks to prepare for the landfall of ike while still providing assistance to areas affected by hurricane the texas rural water association held meetings with state agencies on september 9,  to plan for landfall along the texas gulf september 11,  forecasting models began to show ike making landfall just south of galveston  city manager steven leblanc late wednesday issued a mandatory evacuation order for the low-lying  west end of galveston later  the mandatory evacuation order was extended to the entire island of galveston  as well as low-lying  areas around houston  mandatory evacuations were also ordered for jefferson  orange  and chambers counties located east of houston  voluntary evacuations were in effect for hardin and tyler as well as newton and jasper residents evacuating ahead of ike were received by emergency workers in the dallas fort worth dfw  metroplex where they were provided a place of refuge  medical treatment  and provisions  in addition to the orders of local and state officials  federal officials were thoroughly involved in evacuation decisions  on september 10,  u s  president george w  bush made an emergency declaration for texas  making more federal help available for preparations and more than one million people evacuated in advance of hurricane ike  but more than 100,000  people did 8:19  pm

residents living in single-family  homes in some parts of coastal texas faced  certain death  if they did not heed orders to reports said as many as 40  percent of galveston s citizens did not pay attention to the it was feared to be much the same in port arthur  and it was predicted that low-lying  areas between morgan city  louisiana and baffin bay  texas  particularly those areas east of ike s projected eye landfall would experience the greatest damage from storm surges of up to 20  feet (6.1  price of gas increased in the expectation of damage to some of the numerous oil refineries along the south texas coast  or at least delays in production from the oil and gas platforms in the gulf of 14  oil refineries shut down production and nearly 150  oil tankers and cargo ships waited off-shore  as every port from lake charles  louisiana to corpus christi  texas shut down in preparation for the was lost throughout grand turk island  an estimated 80%–95%  of the houses there were damaged  20%  of which were a total there was also significant structural damage to roofs and buildings containing health services resulting in the disruption of most health the local pharmacy roof collapsed  destroying the area s prescription drug supply  the police station  and the prison was significantly damaged and local supplies facilities were either damaged or water and electricity were also disrupted but since have been restored meanwhile  in south caicos  95%  of the houses were also damaged  with over one-third  significantly damaged or a two-year-old  cruise ship terminal in south caicos owned by carnival cruise lines was significantly damage also occurred on other islands  mostly agricultural or the fishing industry  but in general  the damage was on the islands have been severely weakened and 750  people have lost their due to the extent and magnitude of damage and affected population  the government of the turks and caicos declared grand turk and south caicos islands disaster areas in great inagua island  the bahamas  eighty percent of houses sustained damage with almost a third of them having significant damage  the local morton salt factory was damaged and shut down a few outlining islands suffered minor damage and no casualties was reported  overall damage from the turks and caicos and the bahamas was estimated between $50  million and $200  outer bands of ike caused additional flooding in haiti  which was already devastated by hanna and also hit hard by fay and gustav  the last bridge still standing into the city of gonaïves was washed away  slowing relief in the community considerably and creating a deep humanitarian and food crisis in the hard-hit  74  deaths were reported in haiti from ike  most of which were in the coastal community of cabaret which was swept away by floodwaters and haitian prime minister michèle pierre-louis  called for help at the end of the week  saying that four storms in three weeks have left over 550  dead and as many as one million she also said that parts of gonaïves were so severely damaged that the city may have to be rebuilt two additional deaths were reported in the dominican 2.6  million cubans  a fourth of the population  were evacuated ahead of in baracoa  200  homes were reported to be destroyed and waves were running 23  ft (7  m  high and peaked at 40  ft (12  m  in different areas of cuba  the category 4  hurricane made landfall on september 8  on the north coast of eastern cuba in the province of holguín near puerto de sama  with sustained winds of about 130  mph (209  causing widespread flooding and damage to the eastern it passed across the central provinces of holguín  las tunas  and camagüey  emerging over the sea to the south of cuba during the day  ike dropped to category one intensity by the time it crossed the it then followed the southern coast of cuba and crossed the western end of the island in pinar del río province  close to the path taken by hurricane gustav ten days previously  the western areas of cuba  already devastated by just 10  days before ike hit  suffered additional major flooding from the rain and storm the sugar cane crop was devastated  with over 3,400  square kilometres (1,300  sq mi  destroyed  the banana  yucca  coffee and corn crop also suffered significant alongside gustav  they were described as the  worst ever  storms by cuban total  seven people were killed in cuba from ike due to drowning or collapsing over 300,000  houses were damaged  with an estimated 43,000  a total the combined damage estimate from ike and gustav  and succeeding paloma is about $9.7  billion  usd   with $7.3  billion of that from ike  making ike the most destructive hurricane in cuban to the intensity of the storm  texas closed many of its chemical plants and oil refineries  because much of the united states oil refining capacity is located in texas  the closings caused a temporary increase in the prices of gasoline  home heating oil  and natural increases were particularly high in north carolina  especially in the mountains  where average prices were as much as 60  cents higher than the national the closing of refineries so soon after hurricane gustav  and the time required to restart production  also resulted in shortages of gasoline in such places as the carolinas and tennessee  partly as a result of panic 113  direct and indirect deaths have been reported in the us  including 85  in texas (18  direct   eight in louisiana  one in arkansas  two in tennessee  one in kentucky  seven in indiana  four in missouri  two

a crew of 22  and carried a cargo of petroleum coke  on september 12,  the ship s engine failed  and the ship was adrift 90  nautical miles (170  km  from the shore  the crew unsuccessfully attempted to repair the engine and requested to be evacuated by the coast guard  but the rescue mission was aborted because weather conditions were not within the safety parameters  the crew was forced to ride out the storm but kept in contact with the coast the ship successfully rode out the storm and all 22  crew members were uninjured  on september 13,  a tugboat was dispatched to return the vessel to storm surge ahead of ike blew onshore of louisiana well ahead of ike s predicted landfall in texas on september 13.  areas in coastal south-central  and southwestern louisiana  some of which were flooded by gustav  were re-flooded  as a result of some areas that had not yet recovered from gustav power outages received additional of the hardest-hit  areas were in and around cameron parish  with nearly every square inch of the coastline in that area was flooded heavily  reaching as far north as lake charles  nearly 30  miles hundreds of people had to be including 363  people who were rescued

wind-related  death was reported near two other deaths took place in a car crash in the evacuation phase in iberville and two other storm-related  deaths in jefferson davis parish were caused by natural the morning of september 13,  2008,  the eye of hurricane ike approached the upper texas coast  making landfall at 2:10  am cdt over the east end of galveston island  with a high storm surge  and travelled north up galveston bay  along the east side of houston  see storm-path  image   people in low-lying  areas who had not heeded evacuation orders  in single-family  one-  or two-story  homes  were warned by the weather service that they faced  certain death  from the overnight storm nearly 16,000  families in the galveston-houston  area stayed in temporary shelters under federal housing programs  while 1700  were referred for assistance but could not be reached or were refused needed in regional texas towns  electrical power began failing on september 12  before 8  pm leaving

the high wind and eye wall that passed directly through the city  power outages were a major problem  some residents were without electricity for over a month  because the storm system moved rapidly and did not linger over houston  flooding was not a major problem for most of the city  as it normally is in a storm event  as a result of the relatively flat bolivar peninsula  texas  dozens of people were rescued as flood waters exceeded 12  feet (3.7  m  above sea level in advance of the hurricane  many residents  some trapped by high water on the road at rollover pass and others elsewhere along bolivar peninsula were not rescued  the peninsula bore the brunt of ike s right-front  quadrant  historically the worst part of a hurricane  and experienced catastrophic damage with the worst being between rollover pass and gilchrist  texas – west of high estimates of lost homes in the peninsula were around southeast texas communities of bridge city on sabine lake and large areas of nearby orange (80  miles or 130  kilometres from the center of landfall  were inundated by the storm surge which traveled as much as 16  miles (26  km  inland from the coast  bridge city mayor kirk

sustained wind levels found in a category 1  additionally  a state of emergency was declared in damages in ohio was originally estimated at $553  million with 131,000  insurance claims filed in the first few days following the the overall total damage in ohio exceeded $1.1  billion  tying the 1974  xenia tornado as the costliest storm in ohio s also in salem  indiana  and scottsburg  indiana  wind gusts up to 81  mph (130  km h  were recorded  in indiana  high winds caused more than 200,000  customers to be without power throughout the state  wind gusts of 63  mph (101  km h  were recorded

declared the islands of grand turk and south caicos as disaster areas  damage on the islands was surveyed immediately following the hurricane s passage by a cdera assessment team from jamaica  following the occurrence of extensive power outages  the caribbean electric utilities services cooperation offered to support the restoration of power services  the british hms iron duke (f234)  was sent to the islands to assist in recovery efforts  and personnel from the british red cross were also hurricane ike  many residents applied to fema for loans and fema trailers  many residents were forced to wait several weeks until their trailers arrived  some waited for up to two months  living in hotels  in homes of relatives several miles away  or in their homes  with no power or running

the department of housing and urban development  it was supposed to be used to repair single-family  homes of lower and middle-class  income families  but as of 2011  only 10%  of those funds were released  while the rest were held up because of  state ike also brought many health issues to the victims  damages from the homes and the environment helped create these issues amongst the public  following the disaster  communities were challenged to provide the correct medical treatment in emergency rooms and other medical facilities  it developed stress restricting victims their basic health services  orange county had an 88.5  percent capacity loss of intermediate care facilities reducing its overall capacity  by late october five hospitals that usually served the areas that were impacted by the hurricane stayed closed while only one hospital continued to operate but with a limit of need for mental health services increased after the disaster especially for depression and post-traumatic  stress disorder  most individuals will not progress in constant behavioral or mental health problems  but the world health organization estimates between five and ten percent of victims will have more long-term  telephone interviews and mental health diagnoses were ordered randomly to households concerning the effects of hurricane ike  post disaster mental health occurrences were 5.9  percent for post-traumatic  stress disorder  4.5  percent for major depressive episode  and 9.9  percent for general anxiety a galveston bay recovery study  gbrs  was a survey distributed through a random stratified cluster sampling of victims in the galveston bay area for research on traumatic stress and disaster exposure  when surveyed victims were asked how they felt and what they experienced after the hurricane there was an immediate emotional response of fear from the loss of property  employment  displacement  and children were targeted for physical abuse by parents and guardians because of loss of property and results of post-traumatic  stress disorder  depressive symptoms  anxiety symptoms  dysfunctions  and disabilities were reported when asked how stressful their lives have been since hurricane there was an increase of impairments  interference with social activities and health behaviors such as eating poorly  smoking more  and development of these mental health problems was due to the lack of sufficient clean clothing  electricity  food  money  transportation  or water for at least one week victims and workers face numerous residential and occupational hazards during the process of repairing their homes or community  an exposure to hazardous materials through the process created health threats of diseases  air contamination  smoke inhalation  and lead poisoning  as disaster victims return to their damaged homes children were exposed to the debris and other hazards  developing a risk of after the hurricane because of power outages individuals and family misused portable generators causing carbon monoxide poisoning  eighty-two  percent to 87  percent of carbon monoxide were caused by the improper use of generators  the texas department of state health services issued that gasoline generators should not be used fifty-four  people were reported by the texas poison centers to have storm related carbon monoxide exposure  the undersea and hyperbaric medical society and the center for disease control reported 15  people had to undergo hyperbaric oxygen treatment for carbon monoxide symptoms from exposure were headaches
