 debris -  wikipediadebris or débris  uk   ˈdɛbriː  ˈdeɪbriː   us   dəˈbriː   is rubble  wreckage  ruins  litter and discarded garbage refuse trash  scattered remains of something destroyed  discarded  or as in geology  large rock fragments left by a melting glacier etc  depending on context  debris can refer to a number of different things  the first apparent use of the french word in english is in a 1701  description of the army of prince rupert upon its retreat from a battle with the army of oliver cromwell  in disaster scenarios  tornados leave behind large pieces of houses and mass destruction overall  this debris also flies around the tornado itself when it is in progress  the tornado s winds capture debris it kicks up in its wind orbit  and spins it inside its vortex  the tornado s wind radius is larger than the funnel itself  tsunamis and hurricanes also bring large amounts of debris  such as hurricane katrina in 2005  and hurricane sandy in 2012.  earthquakes rock cities to rubble debris in geology  debris usually applies to the remains of geological activity including landslides  volcanic explosions  avalanches  mudflows or glacial lake outburst floods  jökulhlaups  and moraine  lahars  and lava eruptions  geological debris sometimes moves in a stream called a debris flow  when it accumulates at the base of hillsides  it can be called  talus  or  scree  in mining  debris called attle usually consists of rock fragments which contain little or no ore marine debris applies to floating garbage such as bottles  cans  styrofoam  cruise ship waste  offshore oil and gas exploration and production facilities pollution  and fishing paraphernalia from professional and recreational boaters  marine debris is also called litter or flotsam and jetsam  objects that can constitute marine debris include used automobile tires  detergent bottles  medical wastes  discarded fishing line and nets  soda cans  and bilge waste solids in addition to being unsightly  it can pose a serious threat to marine life  boats  swimmers  divers  and others  for example  each year millions of seabirds  sea turtles  fish  and marine mammals become entangled in marine debris  or ingest plastics which they have mistaken for food  as many as 30,000  northern fur seals per year get caught in abandoned fishing nets and either drown or suffocate  whales mistake plastic bags for squid  and birds may mistake plastic pellets for fish eggs  at other times  animals accidentally eat the plastic while feeding on natural food the largest concentration of marine debris is the great pacific garbage patch marine debris most commonly originates from land-based  sources  various international agencies are currently working to reduce marine debris levels around the world in meteorology  debris usually applies to the remains of human habitation and natural flora after storm related destruction  this debris is also commonly referred to as storm debris  storm debris commonly consists of roofing material  downed tree limbs  downed signs  downed power lines and poles  and wind-blown  garbage  storm debris can become a serious problem immediately after a storm  in that it often blocks access to individuals and communities that may require emergency services  this material frequently exists in such large quantities that disposing of it becomes a serious issue for a community  in addition  storm debris is often hazardous by its very nature  since  for example  downed power lines annually account for storm-related  deaths space debris usually refers to the remains of spacecraft that have either fallen to earth or are still orbiting earth  space debris may also consist of natural components such as chunks of rock and ice  the problem of space debris has grown as various space programs have left legacies of launches  explosions  repairs  and discards in both low earth orbit and more remote orbits  these orbiting fragments have reached a great enough proportion to constitute a hazard to future space launches of both satellite and manned vehicles  various government agencies and international organizations are beginning to track space debris and also research possible solutions to the problem  while many of these items  ranging in size from nuts and bolts to entire satellites and spacecraft  may fall to earth  other items located in more remote orbits may stay aloft for centuries  the velocity of some of these pieces of space junk have been clocked in excess of 17,000  miles per hour (27,000  km h   a piece of space debris falling to earth leaves a fiery trail  just like a meteor a debris disk is a circumstellar disk of dust and debris in orbit around a star in medicine  debris usually refers to biological matter that has accumulated or lodged in surgical instruments and is referred to as surgical debris  the presence of surgical debris can result in cross-infections  or nosocomial infections if not removed and the affected surgical instruments or equipment properly disinfected in the aftermath of a war  large areas of the region of conflict are often strewn with war debris in the form of abandoned or destroyed hardware and vehicles  mines  unexploded ordnance  bullet casings and other fragments of metal much war debris has the potential to be lethal and continues to kill and maim civilian populations for years after the end of a conflict  the risks from war debris may be sufficiently high to prevent or delay the return of refugees  in addition war debris may contain hazardous chemicals or radioactive components that can contaminate the land or poison civilians who come into contact with it  many mine clearance agencies are also involved in the clearance of war debris land mines in particular are very dangerous as they can remain active for decades after a conflict  which is why they have been banned by international war regulations in november 2006  the protocol on explosive remnants of came into effect with 92  countries subscribing to the treaty that requires the parties involved in a conflict to assist with the removal of unexploded ordnance following the end of of the countries most affected by war debris are afghanistan  angola  cambodia  iraq and laos similarly military debris may be found in and around firing ranges and military training areas debris can also be used as cover for military purposes  depending on the situation in south louisiana s creole and cajun cultures  debris  pronounced "day-bree")  refers to chopped organs such as liver  heart  kidneys  tripe  spleen  brain  lungs and pancreas
