 2016  atlantic hurricane season -  wikipediathe 2016  atlantic hurricane season was the most active  costliest  and deadliest hurricane season since 2012.  the season officially started on june 1  and ended on november 30,  though the first storm  hurricane alex which formed in the northeastern atlantic  developed on january 12,  being the first hurricane to develop in january since 1938.  the final storm  otto  crossed into the eastern pacific on november 25,  a few days before the official end  following alex  tropical storm bonnie brought flooding to south carolina and portions of north carolina  tropical storm colin in early june brought minor flooding and wind damage to parts of the southeastern united states  especially florida  hurricane earl left 94  fatalities in the dominican republic and mexico  81  of which occurred in the latter  in early september  hurricane hermine  the first hurricane to make landfall in florida since hurricane wilma in 2005,  brought extensive coastal flooding damage especially to the forgotten and nature coasts of florida  hermine was responsible for five fatalities and about $550  million (2016  usd  in strongest  costliest  and deadliest storm of the season was hurricane matthew  the southernmost category 5  atlantic hurricane on record and the first to reach that intensity since felix in 2007.  with at least 603  deaths attributed to it  matthew was the deadliest atlantic hurricane since stan of 2005.  furthermore  damage from matthew is estimated to be at least $15.1  billion  making it the ninth costliest atlantic hurricane on record  hurricane nicole became the first major hurricane to directly impact bermuda since hurricane fabian in 2003,  leaving widespread but relatively minor damage on the island  the final tropical cyclone of the season – hurricane otto – brought severe flooding to central america in november  particularly in costa rica and nicaragua  otto left 23  deaths and about $190  million in damage  on november 25,  the storm emerged into the eastern pacific basin  the first such occurrence since hurricane cesar–douglas in 1996.  most of the season s tropical cyclones impacted land  and nine of those storms caused loss of life  collectively  the storms left at least 743  fatalities and $16.1  billion in damage most forecasting groups predicted above average activity in anticipation of a dissipating el niño event and the development of a la niña  as well as warmer than normal sea surface temperatures  overall  the forecasts were fairly accurate ahead of and during the season  several meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms  hurricanes and major hurricanes will form during a season and or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country  these agencies include the tropical storm risk  tsr  consortium of the university college london  the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa   united kingdom met office  ukmo   coastal carolina university  ccu   colorado state university  csu   and north carolina state university  ncsu   the forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms  hurricanes  and major hurricanes within a particular year  some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the predicted weakening of the 2014–16  el niño on average  an atlantic hurricane season between 1981  and 2010  contained twelve tropical storms  six hurricanes  and two major hurricanes  with an accumulated cyclone energy  ace  index of between 66  and 103  first forecast for the year was issued by csu on december 11,  who anticipated that one of four different scenarios could occur  the scenario considered most likely was that atlantic multidecadal oscillation  amo  and thermohaline circulation  thc  would be stronger  but effects from el niño would remain  resulting in a slightly above average season  the next most likely scenario was that both the amo and thc would strengthen and the el niño effects would cease to exist  causing a well above average season  in the other two scenarios  which were given the same probability of occurrence  the amo and thc would weaken and the effects of el niño would either disappear or some would remain  resulting in either a near average or well below average subsequently issued their first outlook for the 2016  season during december 16,  2015  and predicted that activity would be about 20%  below the 1950–2015  average  or about 15%  below the 2005–2015  average  specifically they thought that there would be 13  tropical storms  5  hurricanes  2  major hurricanes and an ace index of 79  a few months later  tsr issued their second prediction for the season during april 6,  2016  and lowered the predicted number of named storms to 12  but raised the number of hurricanes to on april 14,  csu predicted that the season would be near-normal,  predicting 13  named storms  6  hurricanes and 2  major hurricanes with ace near on april 15,  ncsu predicted the season would be very active  with 15–18  named storms  8–11  hurricanes and 3–5  major hurricanes  a month later  the ukmo released its forecast  predicting a slightly above-average  season with 14  named storms and 8  hurricanes  it also predicted an ace index of 125,  above the defined average ace index at may 27,  noaa issued its first outlook calling for a near-normal  season with a 70%  chance that 10–16  named storms could form  including 4–8  hurricanes of which 1–4  could reach major hurricane status  noaa also stated that there is a 45%  chance of a near-normal  season  30%  chance of an above-normal  season and 25%  chance of a below-normal  also on may 27,  tsr substantially increased their forecast numbers  predicting activity would be about 30%  above the average with 17  named storms  9  hurricanes  4  major hurricanes and an ace near 130.  the reason for the increased activity forecast was the increased likelihood of la niña forming during the season in addition to a trend towards a negative north atlantic oscillation  which generally favors a warmer tropical atlantic  tsr predicted that there is a 57%  chance that the 2016  atlantic season would be above-normal,  a 33%  chance it would be near-normal,  and only a 10%  chance it would be updated their forecast on june 1  to include 14  named storms  6  hurricanes and 2  major hurricanes to include tropical storm it was again updated on july 1  to include 15  named storms  6  hurricanes and 2  major hurricanes  to accommodate for tropical storms colin and on july 5,  tsr released their fourth forecast for the season  slightly lowering the predicted numbers to 16  tropical storms  8  hurricanes and 3  major on august 5,  tsr released their final forecast for the season  lowering the numbers to 15  named storms and 7  hurricanes due to the influence that la niña being less than anticipated noaa updated their forecast on august 11,  increasing the their predictions to 12–17  named storms  5–8  hurricanes  and 2–4  major 2016  atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1,  it was an above average season and the most active since 2012,  producing a total of 15  named storms  7  hurricanes  and 4  major hurricanes  the first storm  hurricane alex  developed on january 12,  while the final system  hurricane otto  made a crossover to the eastern pacific on november 25.  the higher-than-normal  activity was attributed to many factors  most significantly  one of the strongest el niño events recorded in history rapidly dissipated  transforming to cool-neutral  conditions across the pacific in late summer  this led to warmer than normal sea surface temperatures across the atlantic  though the subtropical regions were slightly cooler than normal  slightly lower than normal sea level pressures  and reduced wind shear  especially in the caribbean sea  which had experienced record values of wind shear in the past recent years  moisture levels  however  were anomalously dry  which likely prevented some of the storms from becoming significant hurricanes  steering currents had also been different from past years  which had previously had a trough of low pressure dominating the east coast of the united the tropical cyclones of this season caused about $16.1  billion in damage and at least 743  being the costliest season since the atlantic hurricane season officially ended on november 30,  year opened up with an anomalous storm in january  hurricane alex  the first such system to develop in january since activity picked up at the end of may into june  with three consecutive tropical storms  bonnie  colin  and danielle  the latter two were the earliest third-  and fourth-named  storms on july saw no storm development for the first time in four years  august saw the formation of six tropical cyclones  including earl  fiona  gaston  eight  and hermine  a category 1  hurricane  earl wrought tremendous damage in belize and mexico  with 81  lives lost in mexico during the passage of earl  it was the deadliest atlantic hurricane in the country since gaston became the season s first major hurricane on august 28,  attaining peak winds of 120  mph (195  km h  over the central on september 1,  hermine struck the florida peninsula as a category 1  hurricane  ending an 11-year  drought of hurricane landfalls in the state  which began after hurricane wilma in october featured another five tropical cyclones  ian  julia  karl  lisa  and matthew  the latter of which persisted into october  matthew proved to be the most significant storm of the season  becoming the first category 5  hurricane in the atlantic since hurricane felix in and  with a death toll of over 600,  it was the deadliest in the atlantic basin since hurricane stan in 2005.  it subsequently struck haiti as a category 4  hurricane  and inflicted catastrophic damage across the impoverished nation  matthew also caused extensive damage in cuba  the bahamas  and the southeastern united concurrently  hurricane nicole meandered south of bermuda for more than a week before making a direct hit on the territory as a major the next four weeks were quiet  until hurricane otto formed in the southwestern caribbean during late november  otto eventually became the latest-forming  major hurricane in the atlantic basin on record  surpassing a storm in after striking nicaragua and becoming the first hurricane on record to pass over costa rica  otto – the final tropical cyclone of the season – then emerged into the eastern pacific basin on november 25,  the first such occurrence since hurricane cesar–douglas in season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy index of 141  which was well above the 1981–2010  median of as well as the highest value since 2010.  broadly speaking  ace is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed  therefore  a storm with a longer duration or stronger intensity  such as matthew  will have high values of ace  it is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39  mph (63  km h   accordingly  tropical depressions are not included here  after the storm has dissipated  typically after the end of the season  the nhc reexamines the data  and produces a final report on each storm  these revisions can lead to a revised ace total either upward or downward compared to the operational weak area of low pressure developed over northwestern cuba in association with a stationary front on january 6.  the frontal wave intensified as it moved into the central atlantic  temporarily attaining hurricane-force  winds by january 10.  steered by anomalous high pressure  the disturbance turned southeast and tracked over warmer waters  its associated fronts dissipated  its wind field became more symmetric  and convection increased near the center  leading to the formation of subtropical storm alex by 18:00  utc on january 12.  despite marginal ocean temperatures  alex benefited from rapidly cooling upper-air  temperatures  and it intensified quickly while turning northeast  the presence of deeper convection near the center and an eye on conventional satellite showcased the storm s transition into a fully tropical cyclone and intensification into a hurricane by 06:00  utc on january 14.  six hours later  it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 85  mph (140  km h   alex turned north after peak  and the storm weakened to a tropical storm before making landfall on terceira island  azores  with decreasing core convection and an impinging warm front  alex transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 18:00  utc on january 15  and was absorbed by a larger extratropical low two days precursor disturbance to hurricane alex produced gusts up to 60  mph (97  km h  on bermuda  as well as swells up to 20  ft (6  m  offshore  this disrupted air travel  downed trees  caused sporadic power outages  and suspended ferry in the azores  the cyclone produced maximum rainfall accumulations up to 4.04  in (103  mm  in peak gusts of 57  mph (92  km h  affected ponta delgada  causing minor to moderate landslides also contributed to minor one death occurred when a victim that suffered a heart attack was unable to be airlifted to a hospital due to unsettled area of low pressure developed into tropical depression two at 18:00  utc on may 27,  while situated about 205  mi (330  km  northeast of great abaco in the bahamas  moving steadily west-northwestwards,  bonnie intensified into a tropical storm on may 28.  shortly thereafter  the storm reached its peak winds of 45  mph (75  km h   however  due to hostile environmental conditions  bonnie weakened to a depression hours before making landfall just east of isle of palms  south carolina  on may 29.  steering currents collapsed afterwards  causing the storm to meander over south carolina for two days  the storm weakened further into a non-tropical  remnant low on may 31,  before emerging off the coast while moving generally east-northeastwards.  on june 2,  bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression just offshore north carolina as conditions became slightly more favorable  the next day  despite increasing wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures  bonnie reintensified into a tropical storm and reached its minimum barometric pressure of 1,006  mbar (29.7  inhg   the storm weakened to a tropical depression late on june 4  and became a non-tropical  low again early the next day to the north of bermuda  the remnants moved east-southeast  until dissipating on june currents along the coastline of the southeast united states led to dozens of water rescues  the body of one 20-year-old  man was recovered in brevard county  florida  after he lingering over south carolina for a few days  bonnie brought heavy rains and widespread floods to the southeastern united states  rainfall totals hit 6  in (150  mm  in much of south carolina  and exceeded 10  in (250  mm  in some areas  flooding resulted in the closure of the southbound lanes of interstate 95  in jasper county  and also inundated the jasper county sheriff s office and detention center  in ridgeland  several buildings were damaged and the local wastewater treatment plant overflowed  spilling discharge into the nearby captain bill creek  damage in this county alone exceeded $640,000.  record-breaking  rainfall was observed across much of the outer banks  on hatteras island  cape point campground was closed for a week due to in north carolina  the body of a 21-year-old  man was recovered in new hanover county  several days after he went missing in rough may 27,  a tropical wave exited the coast of africa  by early june  the wave entered the caribbean sea and spawned a low pressure system  the low remained disorganized with only isolated convection  mostly in the eastern quadrant  convection began to wrap into the center as the storm curved northward into the gulf of mexico on june 3.  after the low passed over the yucatán peninsula on june 5,  the national hurricane center  nhc  upgraded it to tropical depression three  later that day  the depression intensified into tropical storm colin  gradually curving northeastwards  colin remained disorganized as it accelerated towards the coast of florida on june the nhc noted that there was uncertainty in locating the circulation center  instead taking the midpoint between two small-scale  however  the nhc increased the winds to 50  mph (85  km h  following a strong burst in colin s convection  colin continued accelerating to the northeast and made landfall near keaton beach  florida  at 02:00  utc on june 7.  failing to weaken over colin began undergoing extratropical transition after the increasingly ill-defined  circulation moved off the coast of and became fully extratropical hours cuba  heavy rainfall resulted in flooding in the western portions of the island  especially pinar del río province  water left several roads impassable and inundated crops in some about 840,000  acres (340,000  ha  of crops were flooded in old havana  mudslides severely damaged three homes and impacted numerous others to a lesser the storm also produced heavy rainfall over portions of florida  resulting in flooding in some areas  especially hillsborough and pinellas there  the freshwater flooding was compounded by coastal flooding from high tides  winds caused over 93,300  power outages throughout the the storm spawned at least one tornado  which knocked down trees and damaged several cars and homes in four fatalities occurred in the florida panhandle due to heavy rainfall was also observed in portions of georgia  north carolina  and south carolina  two additional drowning deaths occurred in georgia and one in alabama  damage throughout the east coast reached $1.04  tropical wave emerged off the western coast of africa on june 8,  reaching the southwestern caribbean sea by june 15.  convection increased that day  and further organized after the system entered the bay of campeche three days later  subsequently leading to the formation of a tropical depression by 12:00  utc on june 19.  steered west-northwest  and then northwest by a mid-level  ridge  the depression intensified into tropical storm danielle by 06:00  utc on june 20  and attained peak winds of 45  mph (75  km h  six hours later  interaction with land began to weaken the storm a few hours later  and danielle made landfall near tamiahua  mexico with winds of 40  mph (65  km h   the storm rapidly weakened as it moved inland  falling to tropical depression intensity by 00:00  utc on june 21  and degenerating into a remnant low six hours later  the remnant low continued inland before dissipating over the mountains of eastern mexico that same tropical storm warning was issued along the coast of mexico from laguna verde to rio paranuco  it was later discontinued when danielle moved ashore and rapidly danielle dropped heavy rainfall across the affected regions  particularly the areas near veracruz and tamiahua  official amounts were not reported  however the maximum rainfall that was observed was around 6.22  in (158  mm  at cosaultán de carvajal  the cyclone also brought wind gusts up to 45  mph (72  km h   reported near across much of veracruz  officials suspended school activities and the port of veracruz was temporarily closed  flooding in the pueblo viejo municipality affected 1,200  families and prompted activation of public a homeless man drowned in a storm drain in ciudad madero  tamaulipas  after flash flooding impacted the july 26,  a tropical wave emerged into the atlantic from the west coast of africa  the disturbance s rapid movement prevented significant development for several days  by august 2,  a reconnaissance aircraft reported a closed circulation and tropical storm-force  winds  as a result  the disturbance became tropical storm earl around 06:00  utc  steered generally westward by a ridge over the south united states  earl intensified amid warm ocean temperatures and low shear  attaining hurricane intensity and peaking with winds of 85  mph (140  km h  on august 3.  earl struck turneffe caye in belize around 04:00  utc on august 4  and then made landfall just south of belize city about two hours later  it quickly weakened over land  but emerged into the bay of campeche on august 5  as a minimal tropical storm  a hurricane hunters mission flew into earl later on august 5,  measuring 60  mph (95  km h  winds  the cyclone made landfall at that intensity near veracruz  veracruz  around 02:00  utc on august 6.  once inland  earl quickly weakened  falling to tropical depression intensity at 12:00  utc and dissipating by 18:00  precursor to earl brought heavy rain and gusty winds to the lesser antilles and greater antilles  strong winds in the dominican republic downed a power line onto a bus  subsequently causing a fire that killed six people  a boat crash in samaná bay killed seven significant impacts were reported in belize after earl moved ashore as a hurricane  including downed trees and power lines  blown transformers  damaged or ripped-off  roofs  coastal and inland flooding  and a significant storm about 2,000  homes were damaged or destroyed throughout damage in the country reached about $110  million  in mexico  flooding and landslides resulted in severe damage and many deaths  especially in puebla and veracruz  in the former  mudslides damaged hundreds of homes  including 350  in the village of chicahuaxtla alone  huauchinango observed a month s worth of rainfall in only about 24  hours  resulting in mudslides that killed at least 13  people  throughout puebla  there were at least 41  deaths  in veracruz  earl and the resultant landslides damaged about 6,300  homes and 26  roadways  while 13  fatalities occurred  overall  earl left $132  million in damage and 81  fatalities in mexico  with 10  other people on august 14,  the nhc began monitoring a tropical wave and its associated convection off the west coast of africa for potential steered northwest toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge over the central atlantic  the wave organized sufficiently to become a tropical depression by 18:00  utc on august 16.  the depression slowly organized after formation and developed of a central dense overcast feature  with the system becoming tropical storm fiona by 12:00  utc on august despite strong westerly shear  abundant mid-level  dry air  and an otherwise disheveled satellite an advanced scatterometer  ascat  pass indicated a maximum sustained wind speed of 50  mph (85  km h  early on august although sporadic bursts of convection continued amid the hostile environment  fiona weakened to a tropical depression by 06:00  utc on august 22  and degenerated into a remnant low early on august 23  about 375  mi (605  km  south-southwest  of bermuda  the remnants merged with a weakening frontal zone near bermuda on august august 17,  the nhc highlighted the potential for tropical cyclogenesis off the western coast of africa in subsequent a weak area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave emerged into the eastern atlantic three days and the disturbance steadily coalesced into a tropical depression by 12:00  utc on august 22,  about 305  mi (490  km  southwest of the southernmost cabo verde the depression organized while heading northwest  intensifying into tropical storm gaston six hours later and attaining hurricane intensity by 12:00  utc on august 24,  in accordance with data from satellites and an nasa global hawk unmanned after its initial peak in intensity  gaston s satellite appearance began to degrade as an upper-level  low imparted strong southwesterly shear on the causing it to weaken back to a tropical upper-level  winds slackened early on august 27,  and a timely microwave pass highlighted the presence of a low-level  eye well embedded in the storm s central dense overcast  indicating the resumption of gaston s intensification gaston continued northwestward  its motion slowed in a weak steering regime  amid low shear and warm ocean temperatures  gaston attained hurricane intensity for a second time at 18:00  utc on august 27.  about 24  hours later  the storm deepened to a category 3  hurricane on the saffir–simpson scale  the first major hurricane of the season  by 18:00  utc the next day  with a symmetric ring of deep convection surrounding a distinct eye  gaston ultimately peaked with sustained winds of 120  mph (195  km h  six hours a mid-level  trough moving southeastward across the north atlantic eroded a series of ridges steering gaston  causing the system to drift north and northeast  cold water upwelling and an eyewall replacement cycle caused gaston to weaken on august although the cyclone unexpectedly re-intensified  to 120  mph (195  km h  for a second time around 00:00  utc on august 31.  later that day  it began encountering increasingly cool waters and a higher shear  leading the storm to fall below major hurricane status by 18:00  utc on august 31,  and below hurricane intensity by 12:00  utc on september 2.  continuous unfavorable conditions caused deep convection to dissipate  and gaston transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its center grazed flores island at 18:00  utc  gaston s remnant circulation dissipated 24  hours later northwest of the broad low pressure developed on august 26  as a frontal boundary stalled near bermuda and weakened  early on august 27,  the low became well-defined,  but lacked sufficient and was plagued by unfavorable conditions such as dry air and moderate wind however  a large burst of convection near and to the west of the center prompted the upgrade to tropical depression eight at 12:00  utc on august 28  about 350  mi (560  km  southeast of cape hatteras  north a ridge to the north steered the depression westward into an area of moderate wind late on august 28,  the center became exposed from the but convection increased again after about 24  as it approached the carolina coastline on august 30,  a weakness in the subtropical ridge caused the depression to slow down and turn northward  its closest approach to the united states was 60  mi (95  km  south-southeast  of cape hatteras later that day  the depression then turned eastward in response to becoming entangled in the mid-latitude  westerlies  as it accelerated  the circulation began to become elongated  the depression degenerated into a trough of low pressure by 00:00  utc on september 1.  the remnants were absorbed into a frontal system on september precursor low dropped about 1.4  in (36  mm  of rainfall on bermuda  triggering some localized as the depression approached the coastline  a tropical storm watch was issued for cape lookout to oregon inlet  north carolina  early on august 29.  this was later upgraded to a warning with the addition of including the pamlico sound  as the depression failed to intensify and moved away from the coastline  the warnings were discontinued at 00:00  utc on august there were only reports of some rainfall  gusty winds  and minor surf in the outer tropical wave emerged into the atlantic from the west coast of africa between august 16  and august 17.  the wave failed to develop for several days due to its quick movement and dry air  deep convection eventually consolidated and a circulation finally developed by august 28,  with a tropical depression developing at 18:00  utc  about 60  mi (100  km  south-southeast  of key west  florida  initially  the depression moved westward  until a break in a ridge caused it to move northeastward early on august 31.  around that time  the cyclone intensified into tropical storm hermine  the storm steadily intensified into an 80  mph (130  km h  category 1  hurricane by early on september becoming the first hurricane to form in the gulf of mexico since ingrid in hermine made landfall near st  marks  florida  at 05:30  utc  after moving inland  hermine quickly weakened and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september 3  near the outer banks of north carolina  the remnant system meandered offshore the northeastern united states before dissipating over southeastern massachusetts on september precursor system dropped heavy precipitation in portions of the caribbean  especially the dominican republic and in the former  the storm damaged more than 200  homes and displaced more than 1,000  although some areas of cuba recorded over 12  in (300  mm  of rain  the precipitation was generally beneficial due to a severe drought  in florida  abnormally high tides and heavy precipitation along the gulf coast caused significant in citrus county  one of the worst areas impacted  2,694  structures were damaged  of which 531  experienced severe damage  while damage reached about $102  similar coastal and freshwater flooding occurred in pasco county  where 7  homes were destroyed  305  sustained major damage  and 1,564  received minor winds primarily left power outages and downed trees  some of which fell onto buildings and vehicles  about 325,000  people were left without near ocala  a tree fell on a homeless man s tent  killing him  flooding and fairly strong winds in other states such as georgia  south carolina  and north carolina caused additional damage  but to a lesser one death each occurred in south carolina and north in new york  two fishermen drowned near the wading river on long island due to rough overall  hermine caused about $550  million in damage in the united september 5,  the nhc indicated that the development of a tropical cyclone was possible in the east atlantic over subsequent a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of africa on september 6,  slowly coalescing into tropical storm ian by 06:00  utc on september steered north and the northeast by an approaching upper-level  trough  the cyclone struggled within an environment of high shear  with its low-level  center displaced west of its associated an upper-trough  became superimposed with the storm s center by late on september 14,  yielding a more subtropical-like  appearance on conventional satellite  as a result  ian briefly transitioned into a subtropical storm around 18:00  utc  but re-acquired  tropical characteristics just 18  hours later while moving northeastward away from the aforementioned by 06:00  utc on september 16,  a small mid-level  eye became apparent and ian began to with winds reaching 60  mph (95  km h  at that however  deep convection soon dissipated as cold air wrapped into the center  marking ian s transition into an extratropical cyclone around 12:00  on september 17,  ian s remnants were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone and soon september 1,  a tropical wave entered the atlantic from the west coast of africa  a low pressure area developed after a burst in convection near the leeward islands around september 6,  but dry air and wind shear inhibited further development  at 06:00  utc on september 13,  the system maintained sufficient organization to become a tropical depression  around that time  it made landfall in jensen beach  florida  despite being inland  the depression intensified into tropical storm julia over jacksonville and peaked with winds of 50  mph (85  km h  shortly thereafter  the cyclone drifted north-northwestward  and then northeastward  moving offshore the southeastern united states on september 14  under a weak steering regime  a cyclonic loop occurred as strong westerly air developed in the the shear caused fluctuations in intensity  while there were bursts of convection around the disorganized by september 19,  the center of julia was devoid of strong convection  as rainbands rapidly diminished  and soon degraded into a remnant low  the remnants dissipated over eastern north carolina on september of north carolina received as much as 12  in (300  mm  of rain  while as much as 18  in (460  mm  fell in the hampton roads area of virginia  a total of 63  people had to be rescued from their homes  and 61  were evacuated from nursing homes  one million gallons of sewage from elizabeth city flowed into the pasquotank river and charles creek  the cashie river in windsor  north carolina  reached 15  ft (4.6  m  on september 22,  2  ft (0.61  m  above flood stage  that same day  governor pat mccrory declared a state of emergency in 11  counties  schools were closed in bertie  currituck and hertford tropical wave emerged into the atlantic from the west coast of africa on september 12.  the wave steadily organized while passing through the cabo verde islands  and attained sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression by 06:00  utc on september strong shear plagued the cyclone  with its low-level  circulation misplaced from the by 06:00  utc on september 15,  however  a significant burst of deep convection prompted the depression s upgrade to tropical storm karl  the cyclone continued west for several days across the unfavorable central atlantic  with convection sheared to the northeast and the circulation occasionally becoming poorly defined  karl weakened to a tropical depression around 06:00  utc on september 21  as it passed close to an upper-level  however  by the following day  the upper-level  low moved away to the south  causing a reduction in shear that allowed the system to reattain tropical storm intensity as it curved near bermuda  about 800  people lost power indirectly from the storm due to a mainline fault on the island otherwise  impacts on the island were relatively minimal  sustained winds of 46  mph (74  km h  and gusts to over 68  mph (109  km h  were along the east coast of the united states  long-period  swells from karl were recorded as it moved out to accelerating east-northeastwards,  karl continued to strengthen and it attained peak winds of 70  mph (110  km h  early on september however  cold air encroached on the low-level  circulation by 12:00  utc that day  marking karl s transition to an extratropical karl s remnant low continued northeast over the north atlantic and was absorbed by another extratropical system early on september september 14,  the nhc noted the potential for tropical cyclone development in the east atlantic later in the a tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa on september 16,  developing into a tropical depression by 12:00  utc on september 19,  about 225  mi (360  km  west-southwest  of the southernmost cabo verde islands  on september 20,  the depression strengthened to tropical storm lisa  around 12:00  utc on september 22,  lisa peaked with sustained winds of 50  mph (85  km h  and a minimum pressure of 999  mbar (29.5  inhg   the storm soon began weakening due increasing wind shear  but lisa briefly restrengthened on september 24.  lisa managed to maintain tropical storm intensity while battling unfavorable conditions until early on september 25,  weakening to a tropical depression at that time  lisa became a remnant low at 06:00  the remnants were monitored for potential but failed to redevelop and dissipated later that tropical wave developed into tropical storm matthew near barbados on september 28.  continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level  ridge  the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18:00  utc on september 29.  the effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day  and matthew began a period of rapid intensification  during a 24-hour  period beginning at 00:00  utc on september 30,  the cyclone s maximum winds more than doubled  from 80  mph (130  km h  to 165  mph (270  km h   making matthew a category 5  the first since hurricane felix in due to upwelling of cooler waters  matthew weakened to a category 4  hurricane later on october 1.  matthew remained a powerful category 4  hurricane for several days  making landfall near les anglais  haiti  around 11:00  utc on october 4  with winds of 150  mph (240  km h   continuing northward  the cyclone struck maisí in cuba early on october 5.  cuba s and haiti s mountainous terrain weakened matthew to category 3  status  as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the occurred as matthew s circulation became better organized  with the storm becoming a category 4  hurricane again while passing freeport  however  matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place  the storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of florida and georgia  with the northwestern portion of the outer eyewall coming ashore in florida while the system was a category 3  hurricane  matthew weakened to a category 2  hurricane late on october 7  and then to a category 1  hurricane by 12:00  utc on october 8.  about three hours later  the hurricane made landfall at cape romain national wildlife refuge  near mcclellanville  south carolina  with winds of 85  mph (140  convection became displaced as matthew pulled away from with matthew becoming extratropical about 200  mi (320  km  east of cape hatteras  north carolina  on october rains and strong winds buffeted the lesser antilles  the winds caused widespread power outages and damaged crops  particularly in st  lucia  while flooding and landslides caused by the rainfall damaged many homes and roads  one person died in st  vincent when he was crushed by a the storm brought precipitation to colombia s guajira peninsula  which saw its first heavy rain event in three years  one person drowned in a river in in haiti  flooding and high winds disrupted telecommunications and destroyed extensive swaths of land  around 80%  of jérémie sustained significant matthew left about $1.9  billion in damage and at least 546  heavy rainfall spread eastward across the dominican republic  where four were effects in cuba were most severe along the coast  where storm surge caused extensive four people were killed due to a bridge and total losses in the country amounted to $2.58  billion  most of which occurred in the guantánamo passing through the bahamas as a major hurricane  matthew inflicted severe impacts across several islands  particularly grand bahama  where an estimated 95%  of homes sustained damage in the townships of eight mile rock and holmes rock  in florida  much of the damage occurred was caused by strong winds and storm surge in the east-central  and northeastern portions of the state  about 1.2  million people lost damage in florida reached over $2.75  billion and there were 12  an additional 1.3  million people lost electricity in georgia and south carolina combined  torrential rain caused severe flooding  especially in north carolina and south where some rivers exceed record heights set by hurricane floyd and the 1928  okeechobee in north carolina  100,000  structures were flooded and damage reached $1.5  overall  matthew caused at least 603  deaths and about $15.1  billion in tropical wave developed into tropical storm nicole about 530  mi (850  km  northeast of san juan  puerto rico  early on october 4,  based on an ascat pass revealing a well-defined  surface circulation and winds of up to 50  mph (85  km h   the nhc forecast only gradual strengthening as the storm moved slowly to the north due to weak steering an eye then became visible at both mid-  and upper-level  heights  and nicole rapidly strengthened to a category 2  hurricane to the south of bermuda  as winds reached 105  mph (165  km h  early on october with matthew located offshore florida  this was the first time since 1964  that two hurricanes at or above category 2  existed simultaneously in the western atlantic ocean however  nicole was then impacted by wind shear  with the eye soon becoming no longer visible and convection nicole rapidly weakened to a strong tropical storm on october 7.  further weakening occurred as it drifted southward  and by october 8,  the circulation was exposed and the system was barely a tropical storm  with all convection displaced to the later that day  an impressive burst of convection flared up over the center  and nicole again became more organized as it began to turn to the intensification continued throughout the next few days before briefly stopping  then later resuming on october 11  as the storm turned towards bermuda and re-strengthened  to category 1  status  on october 12,  nicole became a category 2  hurricane again  later on the same day  nicole became a major hurricane upon reaching category 3  intensity  the next day  nicole briefly strengthened into a category 4  hurricane  peaking with maximum sustained winds of 140  mph (220  km h   however  the storm weakened back to a category 3  hurricane several hours later due to increasing vertical wind at 15:00  utc on october 13,  the hurricane s eye passed directly over bermuda  where automated surface station measured sustained winds of 87  mph (141  km h  and a gust reaching 119  mph (191  at 06:00  utc on october 14,  southwesterly wind shear reduced the system to category 1  status  the storm slowly began to weaken the next day  falling to a tropical storm intensity early on october 18.  nicole transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 06:00  utc later that november 15,  a broad low pressure area developed in the southwestern caribbean sea  after an increase in convective organization  the system developed into a tropical depression about 120  mi (190  km  north of colón  panama late on november 20.  fueled by warm waters and good outflow  the depression intensified into tropical storm otto by 06:00  utc on november 21.  otto deepened into a hurricane on november 23  while drifting westward  this was the latest date for a tropical cyclone to reach that intensity over the caribbean sea  one day later than the previous record set by hurricane martha in 1969.  otto rapidly intensified throughout the following day  and at 17:30  utc november 24,  the storm made landfall on the southern nicaragua coast near san juan de nicaragua at peak intensity  as a category 3  major hurricane with winds of 115  mph (185  km h   this was the southernmost hurricane landfall in central america  weakening ensued as otto moved inland  around 03:30  utc on november 25,  otto exited into the eastern pacific  marking the first time a tropical cyclone survived the crossover from the atlantic to the eastern pacific since hurricane cesar–douglas in panama  the outerbands of otto brought heavy precipitation and strong winds  the hurricane left nine deaths in the country  with one after a house was struck by a falling tree in panama city  three from landslides  two by drowning in a rain-swollen  river  and three others after the ship jessica generally  rainfall of 3  to 6  in (76  to 152  mm  was observed in throughout the country  otto damaged 857  houses  8  schools  and 2  health facilities  about 5,600  ft (1,700  m  of power lines were damaged  causing power and water four deaths were in costa rica  rainfall peaked at 12.11  in (308  mm  at miravalles flooding and mudslides left 42  communities isolated and damaged 14  water damage reached at least $190  million and there were 10  september 15,  météo-france  began monitoring a cyclone in the bay of biscay that they claimed was subtropical  having apparently possessing an asymmetric wind field of tropical-storm  force winds and a warm thermal however  american meteorological agencies disagreed and determined it was as proven by surface analysis data from noaa  which showed that the cyclone still had an occluded front connected to it – signs that usually indicate an extratropical the system drifted southeastwards  attaining a peak intensity of 996  mbar (29.4  and eventually made landfall near the border of spain and france  rapidly weakening and eventually dissipating shortly thereafter  early on september the free university of berlin  in accordance with their naming of cyclones that affect their area  named the cyclone cyclone brought only minor damage to spain and france  most of which were caused by some strong wind gusts  swells  and some heavy maximum gusts of up to 81  mph (130  km h  were reported on the coast of basque country  with slightly higher gusts in the upper a storm surge of 3–4  ft (0.91–1.22  m  was also reported on the coastlines of spain and france  no major damage  fatalities or injuries were reported as a following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the north atlantic in 2016.  the names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2022  season  this was the same list used in the 2010  season  with the exception of ian and tobias  which replaced igor and tomas  the name ian was used for the first time this year on march 26,  2017,  at the 39th  session of the ra iv hurricane committee  the world meteorological organization retired the names matthew and otto from its rotating name lists due to the amount of damage and deaths they caused  and they will not be used again for another atlantic hurricane  they will be replaced with martin and owen for the 2022  season  is a table of all the storms that formed in the 2016  atlantic hurricane season  it includes
