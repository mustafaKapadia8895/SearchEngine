 gas giant -  wikipediaa gas giant is a giant planet composed mainly of hydrogen and helium  jupiter and saturn are the gas giants of the solar system  the term  gas giant  was originally synonymous with  giant planet   but in the 1990s  it became known that uranus and neptune are really a distinct class of giant planet  being composed mainly of heavier volatile substances  which are referred to as  ices    for this reason  uranus and neptune are now often classified in the separate category of ice giants jupiter and saturn consist mostly of hydrogen and helium  with heavier elements making up between 3  and 13  percent of the they are thought to consist of an outer layer of molecular hydrogen surrounding a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen  with probably a molten rocky core  the outermost portion of their hydrogen atmosphere is characterized by many layers of visible clouds that are mostly composed of water and ammonia  the layer of metallic hydrogen makes up the bulk of each planet  and is referred to as  metallic  because the very large pressure turns hydrogen into an electrical conductor  the gas giants  cores are thought to consist of heavier elements at such high temperatures (20,000  k  and pressures that their properties are poorly defining differences between a very low-mass  brown dwarf and a gas giant  estimated at about 13  jupiter masses  are one school of thought is based on formation  the other  on the physics of the part of the debate concerns whether  brown dwarfs  must  by definition  have experienced nuclear fusion at some point in their history the term gas giant was coined in 1952  by the science fiction writer james and was originally used to refer to all giant planets  it is  arguably  something of a misnomer because throughout most of the volume of all giant planets  the pressure is so high that matter is not in gaseous other than solids in the core and the upper layers of the atmosphere  all matter is above the critical point  where there is no distinction between liquids and gases  the term has nevertheless caught on  because planetary scientists typically use  rock    gas   and  ice  as shorthands for classes of elements and compounds commonly found as planetary constituents  irrespective of what phase the matter may appear in  in the outer solar system  hydrogen and helium are referred to as  gases   water  methane  and ammonia as  ices   and silicates and metals as  rock   because uranus and neptune are primarily composed of  in this terminology  ices  not gas  they are increasingly referred to as ice giants and separated from the gas giants gas giants can  theoretically  be divided into five distinct classes according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties  and hence their appearance  ammonia clouds  i   water clouds  ii   cloudless  iii   alkali-metal  clouds  iv   and silicate clouds  v   jupiter and saturn are both class i  hot jupiters are class iv or v a cold hydrogen-rich  gas giant more massive than jupiter but less than about 500  m⊕ (1.6  mj  will only be slightly larger in volume than for masses above 500  m⊕  gravity will cause the planet to shrink  see degenerate heating can cause a gas giant to radiate more energy than it receives from its host the words  gas  and  giant  are often combined  hydrogen planets need not be as large as the familiar gas giants from the solar system  however  smaller gas planets and planets closer to their star will lose atmospheric mass more quickly via hydrodynamic escape than larger planets and planets farther gas dwarf could be defined as a planet with a rocky core that has accumulated a thick envelope of hydrogen  helium and other volatiles  having as result a total radius between 1.7  and 3.9  smallest known extrasolar planet that is likely a  gas planet  is kepler-138d,  which has the same mass as earth but is 60%  larger and therefore has a density that indicates a thick gas low-mass  gas planet can still have a radius resembling that of a gas giant if it has the right system → local interstellar cloud → local bubble → gould belt → orion arm → milky way → milky way subgroup → local group → virgo supercluster → laniakea supercluster → pisces–cetus supercluster complex → observable universe → universe each arrow  →  may be read as  within  or  part of
