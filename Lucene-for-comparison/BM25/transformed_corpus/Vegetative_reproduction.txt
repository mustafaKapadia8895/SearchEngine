 vegetative reproduction -  wikipediavegetative reproduction  vegetative propagation  vegetative multiplication  vegetative cloning  is any form of asexual reproduction occurring in plants in which a new plant grows from a fragment of the parent plant or grows from a specialized reproductive structure  such as a stolon  rhizome  tuber  corm  or it can occur naturally or be induced by horticulturists although most plants normally reproduce sexually  many have the ability for vegetative propagation  or can be vegetatively propagated if small pieces are subjected to chemical  hormonal  treatments  this is because meristematic cells capable of cellular differentiation are present in many plant tissues  horticulturalists are interested in understanding how meristematic cells can be induced to reproduce an entire plant success rates and difficulty of propagation vary greatly  for example  willow and coleus can be propagated merely by inserting a stem in water or moist soil  on the other hand  monocotyledons  unlike dicotyledons  typically lack a vascular cambium and therefore are harder to propagate in a wide sense  methods of vegetative propagation include cutting  vegetative apomixis  layering  division  budding  grafting and tissue culture  cutting is the most common artificial vegetative propagation method  where pieces of the  parent  plant are removed and placed in a suitable environment so that they can grow into a whole new plant  the  clone   which is genetically identical to the parent  cutting exploits the ability of plants to grow adventitious roots  i e  root material that can generate from a location other than the existing or primary root system  as in from a leaf or cut stem  under certain conditions  vegetative propagation is usually considered a cloning method  however  there are several cases where vegetatively propagated plants are not genetically identical  root cuttings of thornless blackberries will revert to thorny type because the adventitious shoot develops from a cell that is genetically thorny  thornless blackberry is a chimera  with the epidermal layers genetically thornless but the tissue beneath it genetically needed  similarly  leaf cutting propagation of certain chimeral variegated plants  such as snake plant  sansevieria trifasciata   will produce mainly nonvariegated needed  grafting is often not a complete cloning method because seedlings are used as rootstocks  in that case only the top of the plant is clonal  in some crops  particularly apples  the rootstocks are vegetatively propagated so the entire graft can be clonal if the scion and rootstock are both clones  apomixis  including apospory and diplospory  is a type of reproduction that does not involve fertilisation  in flowering plants  unfertilized seeds are involved  or plantlets that grow instead of flowers  hawkweed  hieracium   dandelion  taraxacum   some citrus  citrus  and many grasses such as kentucky blue grass  poa pratensis  all use this form of asexual reproduction  bulbils are sometimes formed instead of the flowers of garlic budding  fragmentation  vegetative propagation  spore formation and budding are all types of asexual reproduction we have learnt vegitative propagation types in this topicvirtually all types of shoots and roots are capable of vegetative propagation  including stems  basal shoots  tubers  rhizomes  stolons  corms  bulbs  and buds  in a few species  such as kalanchoÃ«   leaves are involved in vegetative reproduction natural vegetative propagation is mostly a process found in herbaceous and woody perennial plants  and typically involves structural modifications of the stem  although any horizontal  underground part of a plant  whether stem  leaf  or root  can contribute to vegetative reproduction of a plant  most plant species that survive and significantly expand by vegetative reproduction would be perennial almost by definition  since specialized organs of vegetative reproduction  like seeds of annuals  serve to survive seasonally harsh conditions  a plant that persists in a location through vegetative reproduction of individuals over a long period of time constitutes a clonal colony in a sense  this process is not one of reproduction but one of survival and expansion of biomass of the individual  when an individual organism increases in size via cell multiplication and remains intact  the process is called  vegetative growth   however  in vegetative reproduction  the new plants that result are new individuals in almost every respect except genetic  of considerable interest is how this process appears to reset the aging propagation of particular cultivars that have desirable characteristics is very common practice  reasons for preferring vegetative rather than sexual means of reproduction vary  but commonly include greater ease and speed of propagation of certain plants  such as many perennial root crops and vines  another major attraction is that the resulting plant amounts to a clone of the parent plant and accordingly is of a more predictable quality than most seedlings  however  as can be seen in many variegated plants  this does not always apply  because many plants actually are chimeras and cuttings might reflect the attributes of only one or some of the parent cell lines  man-made  methods of vegetative reproduction are usually enhancements of natural processes  but they range from rooting cuttings to grafting and artificial propagation by laboratory tissue culture in horticulture  a  cutting  is a piece that has been cut off from a mother plant and then caused to grow into a whole plant  often this involves a piece of stem that is treated with rooting liquid or powder containing hormones  in some species root cuttings can produce shoot growth  when the cutting has become a self-sufficient  plant  it is genetically identical to the mother plant except when chimeric tissues or similar complications affect the outcome a related form of regeneration is that of grafting  a stem piece or a single bud  the scion  is joined onto the stem of a plant that has roots  the rootstock   or a stem piece can be joined to a root piece  a popular use of grafting is to produce fruit trees  sometimes with more than one variety of the same fruit species growing from the same stem  rootstocks for fruit trees are either seedlings or propagated by layering a number of commonly cultivated plants are usually propagated by vegetative means rather than by seeds  this is a listing of such plants
