 antimatter -  wikipediain modern physics  antimatter is defined as a material composed of the antiparticle  or  partners   to the corresponding particles of ordinary matter in theory  a particle and its anti-particle  have the same mass as one another  but opposite electric charge  and other differences in quantum numbers  for example  a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge  a collision between any particle and its anti-particle  partner is known to lead to their mutual annihilation  giving rise to various proportions of intense photons  gamma rays   neutrinos  and sometimes less-massive  particle–antiparticle pairs annihilation usually results in a release of energy that becomes available for heat or work  the amount of the released energy is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter  in accord with the mass–energy equivalence equation  e   particles bind with one another to form antimatter  just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter  for example  a positron  the antiparticle of the electron  and an antiproton  the antiparticle of the proton  can form an antihydrogen atom  physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible  as well as anti-atoms  corresponding to the known chemical elements there is considerable speculation as to why the observable universe is composed almost entirely of ordinary matter  as opposed to an equal mixture of matter and antimatter  this asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in the process by which this inequality between matter and antimatter particles developed is called baryogenesis antimatter in the form of anti-atoms  is one of the most difficult materials to produce  individual antimatter particles  however  are commonly produced by particle accelerators and in some types of radioactive decay  the nuclei of antihelium have been artificially produced with difficulty  these are the most complex anti-nuclei  so far antimatter particles can be defined by their negative baryon number or lepton number  while  normal  (non-antimatter)  matter particles have a positive baryon or lepton these two classes of particles are the antiparticle partners of one another the idea of negative matter appears in past theories of matter that have now been abandoned  using the once popular vortex theory of gravity  the possibility of matter with negative gravity was discussed by william hicks in the 1880s.  between the 1880s  and the 1890s,  karl pearson proposed the existence of and sinks of the flow of aether  the squirts represented normal matter and the sinks represented negative matter  pearson s theory required a fourth dimension for the aether to flow from and term antimatter was first used by arthur schuster in two rather whimsical letters to nature in in which he coined the term  he hypothesized antiatoms  as well as whole antimatter solar systems  and discussed the possibility of matter and antimatter annihilating each other  schuster s ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal  merely speculation  and like the previous ideas  differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed negative modern theory of antimatter began in 1928,  with a by paul dirac  dirac realised that his relativistic version of the schrödinger wave equation for electrons predicted the possibility of antielectrons  these were discovered by carl d  anderson in 1932  and named positrons  a portmanteau of  positive electron    although dirac did not himself use the term antimatter  its use follows on naturally enough from antielectrons  antiprotons  a complete periodic table of antimatter was envisaged by charles janet in feynman–stueckelberg interpretation states that antimatter and antiparticles are regular particles traveling backward in way to denote an antiparticle is by adding a bar over the particle s symbol  for example  the proton and antiproton are denoted as p and p  respectively  the same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components  a proton is made up of uud quarks  so an antiproton must therefore be formed from uud antiquarks  another convention is to distinguish particles by their electric charge  thus  the electron and positron are denoted simply as e− and e  respectively  however  to prevent confusion  the two conventions are never mixed there are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that  aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges  such as electric charge and spin   matter and antimatter have exactly the same this means a particle and its corresponding antiparticle must have identical masses and decay lifetimes  if unstable   it also implies that  for example  a star made up of antimatter  an  antistar   will shine just like an ordinary this idea was tested experimentally in 2016  by the alpha experiment  which measured the transition between the two lowest energy states of antihydrogen  the results  which are identical to that of hydrogen  confirmed the validity of quantum mechanics for all matter observable from the earth seems to be made of matter rather than antimatter  if antimatter-dominated  regions of space existed  the gamma rays produced in annihilation reactions along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions would be are created everywhere in the universe where high-energy  particle collisions take place  high-energy  cosmic rays impacting earth s atmosphere  or any other matter in the solar system  produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting particle jets  which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter  they may similarly be produced in regions like the center of the milky way and other galaxies  where very energetic celestial events occur  principally the interaction of relativistic jets with the interstellar medium   the presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two gamma rays produced every time positrons annihilate with nearby matter  the frequency and wavelength of the gamma rays indicate that each carries 511  kev of energy  i e   the rest mass of an electron multiplied by c2).observations  by the european space agency s integral satellite may explain the origin of a giant antimatter cloud surrounding the galactic center  the observations show that the cloud is asymmetrical and matches the pattern of x-ray  binaries  binary star systems containing black holes or neutron stars   mostly on one side of the galactic center  while the mechanism is not fully understood  it is likely to involve the production of electron–positron pairs  as ordinary matter gains kinetic energy while falling into a stellar may exist in relatively large amounts in far-away  galaxies due to cosmic inflation in the primordial time of the universe  antimatter galaxies  if they exist  are expected to have the same chemistry and absorption and emission spectra as normal-matter  galaxies  and their astronomical objects would be observationally identical  making them difficult to nasa is trying to determine if such galaxies exist by looking for x-ray  and gamma-ray  signatures of annihilation events in colliding october 2017,  scientists working on the base experiment at cern reported a measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment to a precision of 1.5  parts per it is consistent with the most precise measurement of the proton magnetic moment  also made by base in 2014),  which supports the hypothesis of cpt symmetry  it should be noted that this measurement represents the first time that a property of antimatter is known more precisely than the equivalent property in matter positrons are produced naturally in β  decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes  for example  potassium-40)  and in interactions of gamma quanta  emitted by radioactive nuclei  with matter  antineutrinos are another kind of antiparticle created by natural radioactivity  β− decay   many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by  and contained in  cosmic rays  in january 2011,  research by the american astronomical society discovered antimatter  positrons  originating above thunderstorm clouds  positrons are produced in gamma-ray  flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the antiprotons have also been found to exist in the van allen belts around the earth by the pamela are also produced in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature  mean particle energy greater than the pair production threshold   it is hypothesized that during the period of baryogenesis  when the universe was extremely hot and dense  matter and antimatter were continually produced and annihilated  the presence of remaining matter  and absence of detectable remaining is called baryon asymmetry  the exact mechanism which produced this asymmetry during baryogenesis remains an unsolved problem  one of the necessary conditions for this asymmetry is the violation of cp symmetry  which has been experimentally observed in the weak interaction recent observations indicate black holes and neutron stars produce vast amounts of positron-electron  plasma via the experiments have found evidence of positrons and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays  amounting to less than 1%  of the particles in primary cosmic rays  this antimatter cannot all have been created in the big bang  but is instead attributed to have been produced by cyclic processes at high energies  for instance  electron-positron  pairs may be formed in pulsars  as a magnetized neutron star rotation cycle shears electron-positron  pairs from the star surface  therein the antimatter forms a wind which crashes upon the ejecta of the progenitor supernovae  this weathering takes place as  the cold  magnetized relativistic wind launched by the star hits the non-relativistically  expanding ejecta  a shock wave system forms in the impact  the outer one propagates in the ejecta  while a reverse shock propagates back towards the the former ejection of matter in the outer shock wave and the latter production of antimatter in the reverse shock wave are steps in a space weather cycle preliminary results from the presently operating alpha magnetic spectrometer (ams-02)  on board the international space station show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality  and with energies that range from 10  gev to 250  gev  in september  2014,  new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at cern and published in physical review a new measurement of positron fraction up to 500  gev was reported  showing that positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about 16%  of total electron positron events  around an energy of 275  ± 32  gev  at higher energies  up to 500  gev  the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again  the absolute flux of positrons also begins to fall before 500  gev  but peaks at energies far higher than electron energies  which peak about 10  these results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive dark matter ray antiprotons also have a much higher energy than their normal-matter  counterparts  protons   they arrive at earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2  gev  indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons  which on average have only one-sixth  of the is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei  such as antihelium nuclei  i e   anti-alpha  particles   in cosmic rays  these are actively being searched for  because the detection of natural antihelium implies the existence of large antimatter structures such as an antistar  a prototype of the ams-02  designated ams-01,  was flown into space aboard the space shuttle discovery on sts-91  in june 1998.  by not detecting any antihelium at all  the ams-01  established an upper limit of 1.1×10−6  for the antihelium to helium flux were in november 2008  to have been generated by lawrence livermore national laboratory in larger numbers than by any previous synthetic process  a laser drove electrons through a gold target s nuclei  which caused the incoming electrons to emit energy quanta that decayed into both matter and antimatter  positrons were detected at a higher rate and in greater density than ever previously detected in a laboratory  previous experiments made smaller quantities of positrons using lasers and paper-thin  targets  however  new simulations showed that short  ultra-intense  lasers and millimeter-thick  gold are a far more effective existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955  by university of california  berkeley physicists emilio segrè and owen chamberlain  for which they were awarded the 1959  nobel prize in an antiproton consists of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark  uud   the properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton  with the exception of the antiproton having opposite electric charge and magnetic moment from the proton  shortly afterwards  in 1956,  the antineutron was discovered in proton–proton collisions at the bevatron  lawrence berkeley national laboratory  by bruce cork and addition to antibaryons  anti-nuclei  consisting of multiple bound antiprotons and antineutrons have been created  these are typically produced at energies far too high to form antimatter atoms  with bound positrons in place of electrons   in 1965,  a group of researchers led by antonino zichichi reported production of nuclei of antideuterium at the proton synchrotron at at roughly the same time  observations of antideuterium nuclei were reported by a group of american physicists at the alternating gradient synchrotron at brookhaven national 1995,  cern announced that it had successfully brought into existence nine hot antihydrogen atoms by implementing the slac fermilab concept during the ps210  experiment  the experiment was performed using the low energy antiproton ring  lear   and was led by walter oelert and mario fermilab soon confirmed the cern findings by producing approximately 100  antihydrogen atoms at their facilities  the antihydrogen atoms created during ps210  and subsequent experiments  at both cern and fermilab  were extremely energetic and were not well suited to study  to resolve this hurdle  and to gain a better understanding of antihydrogen  two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s,  namely  athena and atrap in 1999,  cern activated the antiproton decelerator  a device capable of decelerating antiprotons from 6990560761770449999♠3500  mev to 6987849153538110000♠5.3  mev — still too  hot  to produce study-effective  antihydrogen  but a huge leap forward  in late 2002  the athena project announced that they had created the world s first  cold  the atrap project released similar results very shortly the antiprotons used in these experiments were cooled by decelerating them with the antiproton decelerator  passing them through a thin sheet of foil  and finally capturing them in a penning–malmberg the overall cooling process is workable  but highly inefficient  approximately 25  million antiprotons leave the antiproton decelerator and roughly 25,000  make it to the penning–malmberg trap  which is about 1/1000  or 0.1%  of the original amount the antiprotons are still hot when initially trapped  to cool them further  they are mixed into an electron plasma  the electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation  and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via coulomb collisions  eventually  the electrons are removed by the application of short-duration  electric fields  leaving the antiprotons with energies less than 7002100000000000000♠100  while the antiprotons are being cooled in the first trap  a small cloud of positrons is captured from radioactive sodium in a surko-style  positron this cloud is then recaptured in a second trap near the antiprotons  manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the antiprotons into the positron plasma  where some combine with antiprotons to form antihydrogen  this neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons  and within a few microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls  where it annihilates  some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion in 2005,  athena disbanded and some of the former members  along with others  formed the alpha collaboration  which is also based at cern  the primary goal of these collaborations is the creation of less energetic   cold   antihydrogen  better suited to needed in 2016  a new antiproton decelerator and cooler called elena  e low energy antiproton decelerator  was built  it takes the antiprotons from the antiproton decelerator and cools them to 90  kev which is  cold  enough to study  more than a hundred antiprotons can be captured per second  a huge improvement  but it would still take several thousand years to make a nanogram of antimatter most of the sought-after  high-precision  tests of the properties of antihydrogen could only be performed if the antihydrogen were trapped  that is  held in place for a relatively long time  while antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral  the spins of their component particles produce a magnetic moment  these magnetic moments can interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field  some of the antihydrogen atoms can be attracted to a magnetic minimum  such a minimum can be created by a combination of mirror and multipole antihydrogen can be trapped in such a magnetic minimum (minimum-b)  trap  in november 2010,  the alpha collaboration announced that they had so trapped 38  antihydrogen atoms for about a sixth of a this was the first time that neutral antimatter had been trapped on 26  april 2011,  alpha announced that they had trapped 309  antihydrogen atoms  some for as long as 1,000  seconds  about 17  minutes   this was longer than neutral antimatter had ever been trapped alpha has used these trapped atoms to initiate research into the spectral properties of the biggest limiting factor in the large-scale  production of antimatter is the availability of antiprotons  recent data released by cern states that  when fully operational  their facilities are capable of producing ten million antiprotons per assuming a 100%  conversion of antiprotons to antihydrogen  it would take 100  billion years to produce 1  gram or 1  mole of antihydrogen  approximately 7023602000000000000♠6.02×1023  atoms of anti-hydrogen).antihelium-3  nuclei (3he)  were first observed in the 1970s  in proton–nucleus collision experiments at the institute for high energy physics by y  prockoshkin s group  protvino near moscow  and later created in nucleus–nucleus collision nucleus–nucleus collisions produce antinuclei through the coalescense of antiprotons and antineutrons created in these reactions  in 2011,  the star detector reported the observation of artificially created antihelium-4  nuclei (anti-alpha  particles  (4he)  from such cannot be stored in a container made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches  annihilating itself and an equal amount of the container  antimatter in the form of charged particles can be contained by a combination of electric and magnetic fields  in a device called a penning trap  this device cannot  however  contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles  for which atomic traps are used  in particular  such a trap may use the dipole moment  electric or magnetic  of the trapped particles  at high vacuum  the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant  laser radiation using a magneto-optical  trap or magnetic trap  small particles can also be suspended with optical tweezers  using a highly focused laser 2011,  cern scientists were able to preserve antihydrogen for approximately 17  claim that antimatter is the costliest material to in 2006,  gerald smith estimated $250  million could produce 10  milligrams of  equivalent to $25  billion per gram   in 1999,  nasa gave a figure of $62.5  trillion per gram of this is because production is difficult  only very few antiprotons are produced in reactions in particle accelerators   and because there is higher demand for other uses of particle accelerators  according to cern  it has cost a few hundred million swiss francs to produce about 1  billionth of a gram  the amount used so far for particle antiparticle in comparison  to produce the first atomic weapon  the cost of the manhattan project was estimated at $23  billion with inflation during studies funded by the nasa institute for advanced concepts are exploring whether it might be possible to use magnetic scoops to collect the antimatter that occurs naturally in the van allen belt of the earth  and ultimately  the belts of gas giants  like jupiter  hopefully at a lower cost per reactions have practical applications in medical imaging  such as positron emission tomography  pet   in positive beta decay  a nuclide loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron  in the same event  a proton becomes a neutron  and a neutrino is also emitted   nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a cyclotron and are widely generated for medical use  antiprotons have also been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers  in a similar method currently used for ion  proton  and stored anti-matter  could be used as a fuel for interplanetary or interstellar as part of an antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion or other antimatter rocketry  such as the redshift rocket  since the energy density of antimatter is higher than that of conventional fuels  an antimatter-fueled  spacecraft would have a higher thrust-to-weight  ratio than a conventional spacecraft if matter–antimatter collisions resulted only in photon emission  the entire rest mass of the particles would be converted to kinetic energy  the energy per unit mass (7016900000000000000♠9×1016  j kg  is about 10  orders of magnitude greater than chemical and about 3  orders of magnitude greater than the nuclear potential energy that can be liberated  today  using nuclear fission  about 6989320435297400000♠200  mev per fission or 7013800000000000000♠8×1013  j kg   and about 2  orders of magnitude greater than the best possible results expected from fusion  about 7014630000000000000♠6.3×1014  j kg for the proton–proton chain   the reaction of 7000100000000000000♠1  kg of antimatter with 7000100000000000000♠1  kg of matter would produce 7017180000000000000♠1.8×1017  j (180  petajoules  of energy  by the mass–energy equivalence formula  e   mc2),  or the rough equivalent of 43  megatons of tnt – slightly less than the yield of the 27,000  kg tsar bomba  the largest thermonuclear weapon ever detonated not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic propulsion technology because of the nature of the annihilation products  while electron–positron reactions result in gamma ray photons  these are difficult to direct and use for thrust  in reactions between protons and antiprotons  their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged pions  the neutral pions decay almost immediately  with a lifetime of 85  attoseconds  into high-energy  photons  but the charged pions decay more slowly  with a lifetime of 26  nanoseconds  and can be deflected magnetically to produce thrust charged pions ultimately decay into a combination of neutrinos  carrying about 22%  of the energy of the charged pions  and unstable charged muons  carrying about 78%  of the charged pion energy   with the muons then decaying into a combination of electrons  positrons and neutrinos  cf  muon decay  the neutrinos from this decay carry about 2/3  of the energy of the muons  meaning that from the original charged pions  the total fraction of their energy converted to neutrinos by one route or another would be about 0.22    (2/3)⋅0.78    has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear a major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities  and there is no evidence that it will ever be however  the u s  air force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the cold war  and began considering its possible use in weapons  not just as a trigger  but as the explosive
