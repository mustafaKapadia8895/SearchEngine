 hake -  wikipediathe term hake  ˈheɪk  refers to fish in either of hake is in the same taxonomic order  gadiformes  as cod and haddock  it is a medium to large fish averaging from 1  to 8  pounds (0.45  to 3.63  kg  in weight  with specimens as large as 60  pounds (27  the fish can grow up to 1  metre (3  ft 3  in  in length with a lifespan as long as 14  years  hake may be found in the atlantic ocean and pacific ocean in waters from 200–350  metres (660–1,150  ft  deep  the fish stay in deep sea water during the day and come to shallower depths during the night  an undiscerning predator  hake feed on their prey found near or on the bottom of the sea  male and female hake are very similar in spawning  the hake eggs float on the surface of the sea where the larvae develop  after a certain period of time  the baby hake then migrate to the bottom of the sea  preferring depths of less than 200  metres (660  total of 12  hake species are known in the family merlucciidae not all hake species are viewed as commercially important  but the deep-water  and shallow-water  hakes are known to grow rapidly and make up the majority of harvested needed the highest demand for hake has been in europe  hake has been primarily divided into three principal levels—fresh  frozen  and frozen fillet  fresh hake is mainly supplied by european production and imports  frozen hake and frozen hake fillet are effectively supplied by imports and european processing companies spain has the highest consumption of hake in europe  with a yearly consumption of 6  kg person  this works out to around half all hake eaten in europe  though spanish consumption of hake and other fish declined in the last decade  second fish consumption in the world after japan   hake still accounts for about one third of total fish consumption there  other countries that eat a lot of hake include france  italy  and spain  fresh hake are mostly purchased by restaurants through retailers  nonetheless  processed hake products are distributed by hake wholesalers  fishmongers  public markets and hypermarkets sell hake in various forms  frozen fillet  fillet skin-on,  fillet skin-off,  etc in france  fish are generally purchased in supermarkets  due to insufficient european hake  french wholesalers purchase fresh hake from external countries such as argentina and namibia  and then export them to spain  fresh hake is mostly exported to spain in italy  hotels  restaurants  supermarkets  and institutional purchasers purchase much seafood  however  retailers and wholesalers purchase most frozen hake fillets to sell in markets hake is sold as frozen  fillets or steaks  fresh  smoked  or salted when buying hake fillet or other hake product  consumers should look for hake with white flesh that is free of signs of browning  dryness  or grayness  and a seawater fresh main catching method of deep-water  hake is primarily trawling  and shallow-water  hake is mostly caught by inshore trawl and longlining  hake are mostly found in the southwest atlantic  argentina and uruguay   southeast pacific  chile and peru   southeast atlantic  namibia and south africa   southwest pacific  new zealand   and mediterranean and black sea  italy  portugal  spain  greece and france  due to over-fishing,  argentine hake catches have declined drastically  about 80%  of adult hake has apparently disappeared from argentine waters  argentine hake is not expected to disappear  but the stock may be so low that it is no longer economic for commercial in addition  this adversely affects employment  because many people lose their jobs in the fishing industries  on the other hand  argentine hake prices are rising due to scarcity  this has reduced exports  which ultimately affects the chile  seafood exports  especially chilean hake  have decreased dramatically  hake export has decreased by almost 19  percent  the main cause of this decline is the february 2010  chile earthquake and tsunami  these disasters destroyed most processing plants  especially manufacturing companies that produce fishmeal and frozen hake catches are well below historical levels because of hake depletion in the mediterranean and black sea  however  different factors might have caused this decline  including a too-high  total annual catch  unsustainable fishing  ecological problems  juvenile catches  or non-registered  catches according to the worldwide fund  the only hake species not currently over-fished  is cape hake  found in namibia is the only country that has increased its hake quota  from 130,000  tonnes in 2009  to 145,000  tonnes in furthermore  the local ministry of fisheries adheres to very strict rules regarding the catch of hake  for example  the closed seasons for hake lasts approximately two months  september and october  depending on the level of stock  this rule has been applied to ensure the regrowth of the hake population  supplemental restrictions include forbidding trawling for hake in less than 200  m depth  to avoid damaging non-target  species habitat and minimizing by-catch.frank  forrester s fishermens  guide in 1885  mentions a hake that was transplanted from the coast of ireland to cape cod  united states  it is uncertain which species this was  but the reference is given below this is an irish salt water fish  similar in appearance to the tom cod  in galway bay  and other sea inlets of ireland  the hake is exceedingly abundant  and is taken in great numbers  it is also found in england and france  since the irish immigration to america  the hake has followed in the wake of their masters  as it is now found in new york bay  in the waters around boston  and off cape cod  here it is called the stock fish  and the bostonians call them poor johns  it is a singular fact that until within a few years this fish was never seen in america  it does not grow as large here as in europe  though here they are from ten to eighteen inches to 460  mm  in length  the general color of this fish is a reddish brown  with some golden tints—the sides being of a pink silvery
