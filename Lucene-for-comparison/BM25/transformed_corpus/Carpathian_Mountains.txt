 carpathian mountains -  wikipediathe carpathian mountains or carpathians   kɑːrˈpeɪθiənz   are a mountain range system forming an arc roughly 1,500  km (932  mi  long across central and eastern europe  making them the second-longest  mountain range in europe  after the scandinavian mountains  1,700  km (1,056  mi   they provide the habitat for the largest european populations of brown bears  wolves  chamois  and lynxes  with the highest concentration in as well as over one third of all european plant the carpathians and their foothills also have many thermal and mineral waters  with romania having one-third  of the european romania is likewise home to the second-largest  surface of virgin forests in europe after russia  totaling 250,000  hectares (65%),  most of them in the with the southern carpathians constituting europe s largest unfragmented forested carpathians consist of a chain of mountain ranges that stretch in an arc from the czech republic (3%)  in the northwest through slovakia (17%),  poland (10%),  hungary (4%)  and ukraine (11%),  and romania (51%).  the highest range within the carpathians is the tatras  on the border of slovakia and poland  where the highest peaks exceed 2,600  m (8,530  ft   the second-highest  range is the southern carpathians in romania  where the highest peaks exceed 2,500  m (8,202  ft  the divisions of the carpathians are usually in three major term outer carpathians is frequently used to describe the northern rim of the western and eastern carpathians the most important cities in or near the carpathians are  bratislava and košice in slovakia  kraków in poland  cluj-napoca,  sibiu  and braşov in romania  and uzhhorod in ukraine in modern times  the range is called karpaty in czech  polish  and slovak and карпати  karpaty  in ukrainian  carpați   listen  in romanian  karpaten in german  kárpátok in hungarian  karpati in croatian  and карпати in although the toponym was recorded already by ptolemy in the second century ce  the modern form of the name is a neologism in most for instance  havasok   snowy mountains   was its medieval hungarian name  russian chronicles referred to it as  hungarian mountains   later sources  such as dimitrie cantemir and the italian chronicler giovanandrea gromo  referred to the range as  transylvania s mountains   while the 17th-century  historian constantin cantacuzino translated the name of the mountains in an italian-romanian  glossary to  rumanian mountains   name  carpates  is highly associated with the old dacian tribes called  carpes  or  carpi  who lived in a large area from the east  north-east  of the black sea to transylvanian plains on the present day romania and moldova  the name carpates may ultimately be from the proto indo-european  root *sker-/*ker-,  from which comes the albanian word karpë  rock   and the slavic word skála  rock  cliff   perhaps via a dacian which meant mountain  rock  or rugged  cf  germanic root *skerp-,  old norse harfr  harrow   gothic skarpo  middle low german scharf  potsherd   and modern high german scherbe  shard   old english scearp and english sharp  lithuanian kar pas  cut  hack  notch   latvian cìrpt  to shear  clip    the archaic polish word karpa meant  rugged irregularities  underwater obstacles rocks  rugged roots  or trunks   the more common word skarpa means a sharp cliff or other vertical terrain  the name may instead come from indo-european   kwerp  to turn   akin to old english hweorfan  to turn  change   english warp  and greek καρπός karpós  wrist   perhaps referring to the way the mountain range bends or veers in an late roman documents  the eastern carpathian mountains were referred to as montes sarmatici  meaning sarmatian the western carpathians were called carpates  a name that is first recorded in ptolemy s geographia  second century needed in the scandinavian hervarar saga  which relates ancient germanic legends about battles between goths and huns  the name karpates appears in the predictable germanic form as harvaða fjöllum  see grimm s law   inter alpes huniae et oceanum est polonia  by gervase of tilbury  has described in his otia imperialia   recreation for an emperor   in thirteenth-  to fifteenth-century  hungarian documents named the mountains thorchal  tarczal  or less frequently montes northwestern carpathians begin in slovakia and southern poland  they surround transcarpathia and transylvania in a large semicircle  sweeping towards the southeast  and end on the danube near orşova in romania  the total length of the carpathians is over 1,500  km (932  mi  and the mountain chain s width varies between 12  and 500  km (7  and 311  mi   the highest altitudes of the carpathians occur where they are widest  the system attains its greatest breadth in the transylvanian plateau and in the southern tatra mountains group – the highest range  in which gerlachovský štít in slovakia is the highest peak at 2,655  m (8,711  ft  above sea level  the carpathians cover an area of 190,000  km2  (73,359  sq mi   and after the alps  form the next-most  extensive mountain system in europe although commonly referred to as a mountain chain  the carpathians do not actually form an uninterrupted chain of mountains  rather  they consist of several orographically and geologically distinctive groups  presenting as great a structural variety as the alps  the carpathians  which attain an altitude over 2,500  m (8,202  ft  in only a few places  lack the bold peaks  extensive snowfields  large glaciers  high waterfalls  and numerous large lakes that are common in the alps  it was believed that no area of the carpathian range was covered in snow all year round and there were no glaciers  but recent research by polish scientists discovered one permafrost and glacial area in the tatra the carpathians at their highest altitude are only as high as the middle region of the alps  with which they share a common appearance  climate  and flora  the carpathians are separated from the alps by the danube  the two ranges meet at only one point  the leitha mountains at bratislava  the river also separates them from the balkan mountains at orşova in romania  the valley of the march and oder separates the carpathians from the silesian and moravian chains  which belong to the middle wing of the great central mountain system of europe  unlike the other wings of the system  the carpathians  which form the watershed between the northern seas and the black sea  are surrounded on all sides by plains  namely the pannonian plain to the southwest  the plain of the lower danube  romania  to the south  and the galician plain to the northeast important cities and towns in or near the carpathians are  in approximate descending order of population this is an  incomplete  list of the peaks of the carpathians having summits over 2,500  metres (8,200  ft   with their heights  geologic divisions  and locations this is a list of the highest national peaks of the carpathians  their heights  geologic divisions  and locations in the romanian part of the main chain of the carpathians  the most important mountain passes are  starting from the ukrainian border   the prislop pass  rodna pass  tihuța pass  also known as borgo pass   tulgheș pass  bicaz canyon  ghimeș pass  uz pass and oituz pass  buzău pass  predeal pass  crossed by the railway from braşov to bucharest   turnu roșu pass (1,115  ft   running through the narrow gorge of the olt river and crossed by the railway from sibiu to bucharest   vulcan pass  teregova pass and the iron gate  both crossed by the railway from timișoara to craiova  the area now occupied by the carpathians was once occupied by smaller ocean basins  the carpathian mountains were formed during the alpine orogeny in the and tertiary by moving the alcapa  tisza and dacia plates over subducting oceanic crust  see the mountains take the form of a fold and thrust belt with generally north vergence in the western segment  northeast to east vergence in the eastern portion and southeast vergence in the southern portion the external  generally northern  portion of the orogenic belt is a tertiary accretionary prism of a so-called  flysch belt  the carpathian flysch belt  created by rocks scraped off the sea bottom and thrust over the north-european  plate  the carpathian accretionary wedge is made of several thin skinned nappes composed of cretaceous to paleogene turbidites  thrusting of the flysch nappes over the carpathian foreland caused the formation of the carpathian foreland the boundary between the flysch belt and internal zones of the orogenic belt in the western segment of the mountain range is marked by the pieniny klippen belt  a narrow complicated zone of polyphase compressional deformation  later involved in a supposed strike-slip  internal zones in western and eastern segments contain older variscan igneous massifs reworked in mesozoic thick and thin-skinned  nappes  during the middle miocene this zone was affected by intensive arc volcanism that developed over the subduction zone of the flysch basins  at the same time  the internal zones of the orogenic belt were affected by large extensional of the back-arc  pannonian the last volcanic activity occurred at ciomadul about 30,000  years gold and silver were found in great quantities in the western carpathians  after the roman emperor trajan s conquest of dacia  he brought back to rome over 165  tons of gold and 330  tons of largest range is the tatras in poland and slovakia  a major part of the western and northeastern outer carpathians in poland  ukraine  and slovakia is traditionally called the beskids the geological border between the western and eastern carpathians runs approximately along the line  south to north  between the towns of michalovce  bardejov  nowy sącz and tarnów  in older systems the border runs more in the east  along the line  north to south  along the rivers san and osława  poland   the town of snina  slovakia  and river tur ia  ukraine   biologists  however  shift the border even further to the east the border between the eastern and southern carpathians is formed by the predeal pass  south of braşov and the prahova valley ukrainians sometimes denote as  eastern carpathians  only the ukrainian carpathians  or wooded carpathians   meaning the part situated largely on their territory  i e   to the north of the prislop pass   while romanians sometimes denote as  eastern  oriental  carpathians  only the romanian carpathians part which lies on their territory  i e   from the ukrainian border or from the prislop pass to the south   which they subdivide into three simplified geographical groups  north  center  south   instead of outer and inner eastern carpathians  these are
