 acoustics -  wikipediaacoustics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of all mechanical waves in gases  liquids  and solids including topics such as vibration  sound  ultrasound and infrasound  a scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an acoustical engineer  the application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries hearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world  and speech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture  accordingly  the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society—music  medicine  architecture  industrial production  warfare and more  likewise  animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or marking territories  art  craft  science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole  as in many other fields of knowledge  robert bruce lindsay s  wheel of acoustics  is a well accepted overview of the various fields in word  acoustic  is derived from the greek word ἀκουστικός  akoustikos   meaning  of or for hearing  ready to and that from ἀκουστός  akoustos    heard  which in turn derives from the verb ἀκούω  akouo    i latin synonym is  sonic   after which the term sonics used to be a synonym for and later a branch of frequencies above and below the audible range are called  ultrasonic  and  infrasonic   respectively in the 6th  century bc  the ancient greek philosopher pythagoras wanted to know why some combinations of musical sounds seemed more beautiful than others  and he found answers in terms of numerical ratios representing the harmonic overtone series on a string  he is reputed to have observed that when the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of integers  e g  2  to 3,  3  to 4),  the tones produced will be harmonious  and the smaller the integers the more harmonious the sounds  if  for example  a string of a certain length would sound particularly harmonious with a string of twice the length  other factors being equal   in modern parlance  if a string sounds the note c when plucked  a string twice as long will sound a c an octave lower  in one system of musical tuning  the tones in between are then given by 16:9  for d  8:5  for e  3:2  for f  4:3  for g  6:5  for a  and 16:15  for b  in ascending (384-322  bc  understood that sound consisted of compressions and rarefactions of air which  falls upon and strikes the air which is next to a very good expression of the nature of wave motion in about 20  bc  the roman architect and engineer vitruvius wrote a treatise on the acoustic properties of theaters including discussion of interference  echoes  and reverberation—the beginnings of architectural in book v of his de architectura  the ten books of architecture  vitruvius describes sound as a wave comparable to a water wave extended to three dimensions  which  when interrupted by obstructions  would flow back and break up following waves  he described the ascending seats in ancient theaters as designed to prevent this deterioration of sound and also recommended bronze vessels of appropriate sizes be placed in theaters to resonate with the fourth  fifth and so on  up to the double octave  in order to resonate with the more desirable  harmonious physical understanding of acoustical processes advanced rapidly during and after the scientific revolution  mainly galileo galilei (1564–1642)  but also marin mersenne (1588–1648),  independently  discovered the complete laws of vibrating strings  completing what pythagoras and pythagoreans had started 2000  years earlier   galileo wrote  waves are produced by the vibrations of a sonorous body  which spread through the air  bringing to the tympanum of the ear a stimulus which the mind interprets as sound   a remarkable statement that points to the beginnings of physiological and psychological acoustics  experimental measurements of the speed of sound in air were carried out successfully between 1630  and 1680  by a number of investigators  prominently mersenne  meanwhile  newton (1642–1727)  derived the relationship for wave velocity in solids  a cornerstone of physical acoustics  principia  1687).the  eighteenth century saw major advances in acoustics as mathematicians applied the new techniques of calculus to elaborate theories of sound wave propagation  in the nineteenth century the major figures of mathematical acoustics were helmholtz in germany  who consolidated the field of physiological acoustics  and lord rayleigh in england  who combined the previous knowledge with his own copious contributions to the field in his monumental work the theory of sound (1877).  also in the 19th  century  wheatstone  ohm  and henry developed the analogy between electricity and acoustics the twentieth century saw a burgeoning of technological applications of the large body of scientific knowledge that was by then in place  the first such application was sabine’s groundbreaking work in architectural acoustics  and many others followed  underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines in the first world war  sound recording and the telephone played important roles in a global transformation of society  sound measurement and analysis reached new levels of accuracy and sophistication through the use of electronics and computing  the ultrasonic frequency range enabled wholly new kinds of application in medicine and industry  new kinds of transducers  generators and receivers of acoustic energy  were invented and put to use acoustics is defined by ansi asa s1.1-2013  as   a  science of sound  including its production  transmission  and effects  including biological and psychological effects   b  those qualities of a room that  together  determine its character with respect to auditory effects  the study of acoustics revolves around the generation  propagation and reception of mechanical waves and vibrations the steps shown in the above diagram can be found in any acoustical event or process  there are many kinds of cause  both natural and volitional  there are many kinds of transduction process that convert energy from some other form into sonic energy  producing a sound wave  there is one fundamental equation that describes sound wave propagation  the acoustic wave equation  but the phenomena that emerge from it are varied and often complex  the wave carries energy throughout the propagating medium  eventually this energy is transduced again into other forms  in ways that again may be natural and or volitionally contrived  the final effect may be purely physical or it may reach far into the biological or volitional domains  the five basic steps are found equally well whether we are talking about an earthquake  a submarine using sonar to locate its foe  or a band playing in a rock concert the central stage in the acoustical process is wave propagation  this falls within the domain of physical acoustics  in fluids  sound propagates primarily as a pressure wave  in solids  mechanical waves can take many forms including longitudinal waves  transverse waves and surface waves acoustics looks first at the pressure levels and frequencies in the sound wave and how the wave interacts with the environment  this interaction can be described as either a diffraction  interference or a reflection or a mix of the three  if several media are present  a refraction can also occur  transduction processes are also of special importance to acoustics in fluids such as air and water  sound waves propagate as disturbances in the ambient pressure level  while this disturbance is usually small  it is still noticeable to the human ear  the smallest sound that a person can hear  known as the threshold of hearing  is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure  the loudness of these disturbances is related to the sound pressure level  spl  which is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels physicists and acoustic engineers tend to discuss sound pressure levels in terms of frequencies  partly because this is how our ears interpret sound  what we experience as  higher pitched  or  lower pitched  sounds are pressure vibrations having a higher or lower number of cycles per second  in a common technique of acoustic measurement  acoustic signals are sampled in time  and then presented in more meaningful forms such as octave bands or time frequency plots  both of these popular methods are used to analyze sound and better understand the acoustic phenomenon the entire spectrum can be divided into three sections  audio  ultrasonic  and infrasonic  the audio range falls between 20  hz and 20,000  hz  this range is important because its frequencies can be detected by the human ear  this range has a number of applications  including speech communication and music  the ultrasonic range refers to the very high frequencies  20,000  hz and higher  this range has shorter wavelengths which allow better resolution in imaging technologies  medical applications such as ultrasonography and elastography rely on the ultrasonic frequency range  on the other end of the spectrum  the lowest frequencies are known as the infrasonic range  these frequencies can be used to study geological phenomena such as earthquakes analytic instruments such as the spectrum analyzer facilitate visualization and measurement of acoustic signals and their properties  the spectrogram produced by such an instrument is a graphical display of the time varying pressure level and frequency profiles which give a specific acoustic signal its defining character a transducer is a device for converting one form of energy into another  in an electroacoustic context  this means converting sound energy into electrical energy  or vice versa   electroacoustic transducers include loudspeakers  microphones  hydrophones and sonar projectors  these devices convert a sound pressure wave to or from an electric signal  the most widely used transduction principles are electromagnetism  electrostatics and piezoelectricity the transducers in most common loudspeakers  e g  woofers and tweeters   are electromagnetic devices that generate waves using a suspended diaphragm driven by an electromagnetic voice coil  sending off pressure waves  electret microphones and condenser microphones employ electrostatics—as the sound wave strikes the microphone s diaphragm  it moves and induces a voltage change  the ultrasonic systems used in medical ultrasonography employ piezoelectric transducers  these are made from special ceramics in which mechanical vibrations and electrical fields are interlinked through a property of the material itself an acoustician is an expert in the science of are many types of acoustician  but they usually have a bachelor s degree or higher qualification  some possess a degree in acoustics  while others enter the discipline via studies in fields such as physics or engineering  much work in acoustics requires a good grounding in mathematics and science  many acoustic scientists work in research and development  some conduct basic research to advance our knowledge of the perception  e g  hearing  psychoacoustics or neurophysiology  of speech  music and noise  other acoustic scientists advance understanding of how sound is affected as it moves through environments  e g  underwater acoustics  architectural acoustics or structural acoustics  others areas of work are listed under subdisciplines below  acoustic scientists work in government  university and private industry laboratories  many go on to work in acoustical engineering  some positions  such as faculty  academic staff  require a doctor of philosophy these
