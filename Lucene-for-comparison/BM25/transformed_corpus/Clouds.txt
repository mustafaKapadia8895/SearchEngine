 cloud -  wikipediain meteorology  a cloud is an aerosol comprising a visible mass of minute liquid droplets  frozen crystals  or particles suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary the droplets and crystals may be made of water or various chemicals  on earth  clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point  or when it gains sufficient moisture  usually in the form of water vapor  from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature  they are seen in the earth s homosphere  which includes the troposphere  stratosphere  and mesosphere   nephology is the science of clouds which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology there are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the atmosphere  latin and common  cloud types in the troposphere  the atmospheric layer closest to earth s surface  have latin names due to the universal adaptation of luke howard s nomenclature  formally proposed in 1802,  it became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms that appear in any or all of three altitude levels  formerly known as étages   these physical types  in approximate ascending order of convective activity  include stratiform sheets  cirriform wisps and patches  stratocumuliform layers  mainly structured as rolls  ripples  and patches   cumuliform heaps  and very large cumulonimbiform heaps that often show complex structure  the physical forms are divided by altitude level into ten basic genus-types.  the latin names for applicable high-level  genera carry a cirro-  prefix  and an alto-  prefix is added to the names of the mid-level  genus-types.  most of the genera can be subdivided into species and further subdivided into varieties two cirriform clouds that form higher up in the stratosphere and mesosphere have common names for their main types  they are seen infrequently  mostly in the polar regions of earth  clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other planets and moons in the solar system and beyond  however  due to their different temperature characteristics  they are often composed of other substances such as methane  ammonia  and sulfuric acid as well as water taken as a whole  homospheric clouds can be cross-classified  by form and level to derive the ten tropospheric genera and the two additional major types above the troposphere  the cumulus genus includes three species that indicate vertical size  clouds with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one altitude level are officially classified as low-  or mid-level  according to the altitude range at which each initially forms  however they are also more informally classified as multi-level  or vertical the origin of the term cloud can be found in the old english clud or clod  meaning a hill or a mass of rock  around the beginning of the 13th  century  it was extended as a metaphor to include rain clouds as masses of evaporated water in the sky because of the similarity in appearance between a mass of rock and a cumulus heap cloud  over time  the metaphoric term replaced the original old english weolcan to refer to clouds in cloud studies were not made in isolation  but were observed in combination with other weather elements and even other natural sciences  in about 340  bc the greek philosopher aristotle wrote meteorologica  a work which represented the sum of knowledge of the time about natural science  including weather and climate  for the first time  precipitation and the clouds from which precipitation fell were called meteors  which originate from the greek word meteoros  meaning  high in the sky   from that word came the modern term meteorology  the study of clouds and weather  meteorologica was based on intuition and simple observation  but not on what is now considered the scientific method  nevertheless  it was the first known work that attempted to treat a broad range of meteorological centuries of speculative theories about the formation and behavior of clouds  the first truly scientific studies were undertaken by luke howard in england and jean-baptiste  lamarck in france  howard was a methodical observer with a strong grounding in the latin language and used his background to classify the various tropospheric cloud types during 1802.  he believed that the changing cloud forms in the sky could unlock the key to weather forecasting  lamarck had worked independently on cloud classification the same year and had come up with a different naming scheme that failed to make an impression even in his home country of france because it used unusual french names for cloud types  his system of nomenclature included twelve categories of clouds  with such names as  translated from french  hazy clouds  dappled clouds and broom-like  clouds  by contrast  howard used universally accepted latin  which caught on quickly after it was published in as a sign of the popularity of the naming scheme  the german dramatist and poet johann wolfgang von goethe composed four poems about clouds  dedicating them to howard  an elaboration of howard s system was eventually formally adopted by the international meteorological conference in this system covered only the tropospheric cloud types  but the discovery of clouds above the troposphere during the late 19th.  century eventually led to the creation separate classification schemes for these very high classification is based on a hierarchy of categories with physical forms and altitude levels at the these are cross-classified  into a total of ten genus types  most of which can be divided into species and further subdivided into varieties which are at the bottom of the in the troposphere assume five physical forms based on structure and process of formation  these forms are commonly used for the purpose of satellite they are given below in approximate ascending order of instability or convective two of the forms are each divided into several genera that are differentiated mainly by altitude range or level  the other three comprise just one genus type for each form.non-convective  stratiform clouds appear in stable airmass conditions and  in general  have flat sheet-like  structures that can form at any altitude in the very low stratiform cloud results when advection fog is lifted above surface level during breezy conditions  the stratiform group is divided by altitude range into the genera cirrostratus (high-level),  altostratus (mid-level),  stratus (low-level),  and nimbostratus clouds are generally of the genus cirrus and have the appearance of detached or semi-merged  filaments  they form at high tropospheric altitudes in air that is mostly stable with little or no convective activity  although denser patches may occasionally show buildups caused by limited high-level  convection where the air is partly of this structure have both cumuliform and stratiform characteristics in the form of rolls  ripples  or patches  they generally form as a result of limited convection in an otherwise mostly stable airmass topped by an inversion if the inversion layer is absent or higher in the troposphere  increased convective activity may cause the cloud layers to develop tops in the form of turrets consisting of embedded cumuliform buildups  the stratocumuliform group is divided into cirrocumulus (high-level),  altocumulus (mid-level),  and stratocumulus (low-level).cumuliform  clouds generally appear in isolated heaps or they are the product of localized but generally free-convective  lift where there are no inversion layers in the atmosphere to limit vertical growth  in general  small cumuliform clouds tend to indicate comparatively weak instability  larger cumuliform types are a sign of moderate to strong atmospheric instability and convective depending on their vertical size  clouds of the cumulus genus type may be low-level  or multi-level  with moderate to towering vertical extent the largest free-convective  clouds comprise the genus cumulonimbus which are multi-level  because of their towering vertical extent  they occur in highly unstable and often have complex structures that include cirriform tops and multiple accessory clouds tropospheric clouds form in any of three levels  formerly called étages  based on altitude range above the earth s surface  the grouping of clouds into levels is commonly done for the purposes of cloud atlases  surface weather and weather the base-height  range for each level varies depending on the latitudinal geographical each altitude level comprises two or three genus types differentiated mainly by physical form the standard levels and genus-types  are summarised below in approximate descending order of the altitude at which each is normally multi-level  clouds with significant vertical extent are separately listed and summarized in approximate ascending order of instability or convective clouds form at altitudes of 3,000  to 7,600  m (10,000  to 25,000  ft  in the polar regions  5,000  to 12,200  m (16,500  to 40,000  ft  in the temperate regions and 6,100  to 18,300  m (20,000  to 60,000  ft  in the all cirriform clouds are classified as high and thus constitute a single genus cirrus  ci   stratocumuliform and stratiform clouds in the high altitude range carry the prefix cirro-,  yielding the respective genus names cirrocumulus  cc  and cirrostratus  cs   when limited-resolution  satellite images of high clouds are analysed without supporting data from direct human observations  it becomes impossible to distinguish between individual forms or genus types  which are then collectively identified as high-type   or informally as cirrus-type  even though not all high clouds are of the cirrus form or clouds in the middle level are prefixed by alto-,  yielding the genus names altocumulus  ac  and altostratus  as   these clouds can form as low as 2,000  m (6,500  ft  above surface at any latitude  but may be based as high as 4,000  m (13,000  ft  near the poles  7,000  m (23,000  ft  at mid latitudes  and 7,600  m (25,000  ft  in the as with high clouds  it is not possible to distinguish between individual forms or genera using satellite photography alone  without the support of human observations  these clouds are usually collectively identified as middle-type  on satellite clouds are found from near surface up to 2,000  m (6,500  genus types in this level either have no prefix or carry one that refers to a characteristic other than altitude  clouds that form in the low level of the troposphere are generally of larger structure than those that form in the middle and high levels  so they can usually be identified by their forms and genus types using satellite photography clouds have low to middle level bases that form anywhere from near surface to about 2,400  m (8,000  ft  and tops that can extend into the high altitude range  nimbostratus and some cumulus in this group usually achieve moderate or deep vertical extent  but without towering structure  however  with sufficient airmass instability  upward-growing  cumuliform clouds can grow to high towering proportions  although genus types with vertical extent are often informally considered a single the international civil aviation organization  icao  distinguishes towering vertical clouds more formally as a separate group or sub-group.  it is specified that these very large cumuliform and cumulonimbiform types must be identified by their standard names or abbreviations in all aviation observations  metars  and forecasts  tafs  to warn pilots of possible severe weather and multi-level  clouds are of even larger structure than low clouds  and are therefore identifiable by their forms and genera   and even species in the case of cumulus congestus  using satellite clouds are sometimes classified separately from the other vertical or multi-level  types because of their ability to produce severe types are commonly divided into subtypes called species that indicate specific structural details which can vary according to the stability and windshear characteristics of the atmosphere at any given time and location  despite this hierarchy  a particular species may be a subtype of more than one genus  especially if the genera are of the same physical form and are differentiated from each other mainly by altitude or level  there are a few species  each of which can be associated with genera of more than one physical the species types are grouped below according to the physical forms and genera with which each is normally associated  the forms  genera  and species are listed in approximate ascending order of instability or convective and species types are further subdivided into varieties whose names can appear after the species name to provide a fuller description of a cloud  some cloud varieties are not restricted to a specific altitude level or form  and can therefore be common to more than one genus or or mostly stable of the stratiform group  high-level  cirrostratus comprises two species  cirrostratus nebulosus has a rather diffuse appearance lacking in structural cirrostratus fibratus is a species made of semi-merged  filaments that are transitional to or from mid-level  altostratus and multi-level  nimbostratus always have a flat or diffuse appearance and are therefore not subdivided into species  low stratus is of the species except when broken up into ragged sheets of stratus fractus  see clouds have three non-convective  species that can form in mostly stable airmass conditions  cirrus fibratus comprise filaments that may be straight  wavy  or occasionally twisted by non-convective  wind the species uncinus is similar but has upturned hooks at the ends  cirrus spissatus appear as opaque patches that can show light grey genus-types   cirrocumulus  altocumulus  and stratocumulus  that appear in mostly stable air have two species each  the stratiformis species normally occur in extensive sheets or in smaller patches where there is only minimal convective clouds of the lenticularis species tend to have lens-like  shapes tapered at the ends  they are most commonly seen as orographic mountain-wave  clouds  but can occur anywhere in the troposphere where there is strong wind shear combined with sufficient airmass stability to maintain a generally flat cloud structure  these two species can be found in the high  middle  or low level of the troposphere depending on the stratocumuliform genus or genera present at any given the species fractus shows variable instability because it can be a subdivision of genus-types  of different physical forms that have different stability characteristics  this subtype can be in the form of ragged but mostly stable stratiform sheets  stratus fractus  or small ragged cumuliform heaps with somewhat greater instability  cumulus when they form at low altitudes  stratiform and cumuliform genus-types  can be torn up into shreds by brisk low level winds that create mechanical turbulence against the ground  fractus clouds can form in precipitation at low altitudes  with or without brisk or gusty winds  they are closely associated with precipitating cloud systems of considerable vertical and sometimes horizontal extent  so they are also classified as accessory clouds under the name pannus  see section on supplementary features  partly unstable these species are subdivisions of genus types that occur in partly unstable air  the species castellanus appears when a mostly stable stratocumuliform or cirriform layer becomes disturbed by localized areas of airmass instability  usually in the morning or afternoon  this results in the formation of cumuliform buildups arising from a common stratiform castellanus resembles the turrets of a castle when viewed from the side  and can be found with stratocumuliform genera at any tropospheric altitude level and with limited-convective  patches of high-level  cirrus  tufted clouds of the more detached floccus species are subdivisions of genus-types  which may be cirriform or stratocumuliform in overall structure  they are sometimes seen with cirrus  and with tufted cirrocumulus  altocumulus  and stratocumulus  low and mid level castellanus or floccus can resemble cumulo-  and cumulonimbogenitus formations  see  mother clouds  section   however  the latter genitus types are seen mostly in the evening and are the result of cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds dissipating rather than forming or building a newly recognized species of stratocumulus or altocumulus has been given the name volutus  a roll cloud that can occur ahead of a cumulonimbus there are some volutus clouds that form as a consequence of interactions with specific geographical features rather than with a parent cloud  perhaps the strangest geographically specific cloud of this type is the morning glory  a rolling cylindrical cloud that appears unpredictably over the gulf of carpentaria in northern australia  associated with a powerful  ripple  in the atmosphere  the cloud may be  surfed  in glider or mostly unstable more general airmass instability in the troposphere tends to produce clouds of the more freely convective cumulus genus type  whose species are mainly indicators of degrees of atmospheric instability and resultant vertical development of the clouds  a cumulus cloud initially forms in the low level of the troposphere as a cloudlet of the species humilis that shows only slight vertical development  if the air becomes more unstable  the cloud tends to grow vertically into the species mediocris  then congestus  the tallest cumulus which is the same type that the international civil aviation organization refers to as  towering cumulus  with highly unstable atmospheric conditions  large cumulus may continue to grow into cumulonimbus calvus  essentially a very tall congestus cloud that produces thunder   then ultimately into the species capillatus when supercooled water droplets at the top of the cloud turn into ice crystals giving it a cirriform cloud varieties fall into one of two main groups  one group identifies the opacities of particular low and mid-level  cloud structures and comprises the varieties translucidus  thin translucent   perlucidus  thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks   and opacus  thick opaque   these varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity  all three are associated with the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus  however  only two varieties are seen with altostratus and stratus nebulosus whose uniform structures prevent the formation of a perlucidus variety  opacity-based  varieties are not applied to high clouds because they are always translucent  or in the case of cirrus spissatus  always similarly  these varieties are also not associated with moderate and towering vertical clouds because they are always opaque.pattern-baseda  second group describes the occasional arrangements of cloud structures into particular patterns that are discernible by a surface-based  observer  cloud fields usually being visible only from a significant altitude above the formations   these varieties are not always present with the genera and species with which they are otherwise associated  but only appear when atmospheric conditions favor their formation  intortus and vertebratus varieties occur on occasion with cirrus fibratus  they are respectively filaments twisted into irregular shapes  and those that are arranged in fishbone patterns  usually by uneven wind currents that favor the formation of these varieties  the variety radiatus is associated with cloud rows of a particular type that appear to converge at the horizon  it is sometimes seen with the fibratus and uncinus species of cirrus  the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus  the mediocris and sometimes humilis species of and with the genus altostratus another variety  duplicatus  closely spaced layers of the same type  one above the other   is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species  and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis  the variety undulatus  having a wavy undulating base  can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis  and with altostratus  it is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus  the variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes in the form of a honeycomb or net  it is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis  castellanus  and floccus  and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and combinations it is possible for some species to show combined varieties at one time  especially if one variety is opacity-based  and the other is pattern-based.  an example of this would be a layer of altocumulus stratiformis arranged in seemingly converging rows separated by small breaks  the full technical name of a cloud in this configuration would be altocumulus stratiformis radiatus perlucidus  which would identify respectively its genus  species  and two combined features and accessory clouds are not further subdivisions of cloud types below the species and variety level  rather  they are either hydrometeors or special cloud types with their own latin names that form in association with certain cloud genera  species  and supplementary features  whether in the form of clouds or precipitation  are directly attached to the main genus-cloud.  accessory clouds  by contrast  are generally detached from the main group of supplementary features are not actual cloud formations  but precipitation that falls when water droplets or ice crystals that make up visible clouds have grown too heavy to remain aloft  virga is a feature seen with clouds producing precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground  these being of the genera cirrocumulus  altocumulus  altostratus  nimbostratus  stratocumulus  cumulus  and the precipitation reaches the ground without completely evaporating  it is designated as the feature this normally occurs with altostratus opacus  which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation  and with thicker clouds that show significant vertical development  of the latter  upward-growing  cumulus mediocris produces only isolated light showers  while downward growing nimbostratus is capable of heavier  more extensive precipitation  towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events  but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving  cold fronts  showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds  cumulonimbus  the largest of all cloud genera  has the capacity to produce very heavy showers  low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation  but this always occurs as the feature praecipitatio due to the fact this cloud genus lies too close to the ground to allow for the formation of is the most type-specific  supplementary feature  seen only with cumulonimbus of the species capillatus  a cumulonimbus incus cloud top is one that has spread out into a clear anvil shape as a result of rising air currents hitting the stability layer at the tropopause where the air no longer continues to get colder with increasing mamma feature forms on the bases of clouds as downward-facing  bubble-like  protuberances caused by localized downdrafts within the cloud  it is also sometimes called mammatus  an earlier version of the term used before a standardization of latin nomenclature brought about by the world meterorological organization during the 20th  century  the best-known  is cumulonimbus with mammatus  but the mamma feature is also seen occasionally with cirrus  cirrocumulus  altocumulus  altostratus  and tuba feature is a cloud column that may hang from the bottom of a cumulus or cumulonimbus  a newly formed or poorly organized column might be comparatively benign  but can quickly intensify into a funnel cloud or arcus feature is a roll cloud with ragged edges attached to the lower front part of cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that forms along the leading edge of a squall line or thunderstorm a large arcus formation can have the appearance of a dark menacing new supplementary features have been formally recognized by the world meteorological organization  wmo   the feature fluctus can form under conditions of strong atmospheric wind shear and instability when wave-like  clouds of the variety undulatus break into regularly spaced crests  this variant is sometimes known informally as a kelvin–helmholtz  wave  cloud  this phenomenon has also been observed in cloud formations over other planets and even in the sun s another highly disturbed but more chaotic wave-like  cloud feature associated with the undulatus variety has been given the latin name asperitus  the supplementary feature cavum is a circular fall-streak  hole that occasionally forms in a thin layer of supercooled altocumulus or cirrocumulus  fall streaks consisting of virga or wisps of cirrus are usually seen beneath the hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude  this type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes  a murus feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering  rotating cloud base than can lead to the development of tornadoes  a cauda feature is a tail cloud that extends horizontally away from the murus cloud and is the result of air feeding into the cloud formations detached from the main cloud are known as accessory the heavier precipitating clouds  nimbostratus  towering cumulus  cumulus congestus   and cumulonimbus typically see the formation in precipitation of the pannus feature  low ragged clouds of the genera and species cumulus fractus or stratus fractus a group of accessory clouds comprise formations that are associated mainly with upward-growing  cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds of free convection  pileus is a cap cloud that can form over a cumulonimbus or large cumulus whereas a velum feature is a thin horizontal sheet that sometimes forms like an apron around the middle or in front of the parent an accessory cloud recently officially recognized the world meteorological organization is the flumen  also known more informally as the beaver s tail  it is formed by the warm  humid inflow of a super-cell  thunderstorm  and can be mistaken for a tornado  although the flumen can indicate a tornado risk  it is similar in appearance to pannus or scud clouds and does not initially form in clear air or become clouds when fog rises above surface level  the genus of a newly formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content  if these characteristics change over time  the genus tends to change accordingly  when this happens  the original genus is called a mother cloud  if the mother cloud retains much of its original form after the appearance of the new genus  it is termed a genitus cloud  one example of this is stratocumulus cumulogenitus  a stratocumulus cloud formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift  if the mother cloud undergoes a complete change in genus  it is considered to be a mutatus genitus and mutatus categories have been expanded to include certain types that do not originate from pre-existing  clouds  the term flammagenitus  latin for 'fire-made')  applies to cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions  smaller low-level   pyrocumulus  or  fumulus  clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus homogenitus  latin for 'man-made').  contrails formed from the exhaust of aircraft flying in the upper level of the troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling any of the high cloud genus-types  and are now officially designated as cirrus  cirrostratus  or cirrocumulus homogenitus  if a homogenitus cloud of one genus changes to another genus type  it is then termed a homomutatus cloud  stratus cataractagenitus  latin for 'cataract-made')  are generated by the spray from waterfalls  silvagenitus  latin for 'forest-made')  is a stratus cloud that forms as water vapor is added to the air above a forest clouds can be organized into  fields  that take on certain specially classified shapes and characteristics  in general  these fields are more discernible from high altitudes than from ground level  they can often be found in the following forms these patterns are formed from a phenomenon known as a kármán vortex which is named after the engineer and fluid dynamicist theodore von when wind driven clouds are forced through a mountain range  or when ocean wind driven clouds encounter a high elevation island  they can begin to circle the mountain or high land mass  they can form at any altitude in the troposphere and are not restricted to any particular cloud type air can become saturated as a result of being cooled to its dew point or by having moisture added from an adjacent source  adiabatic cooling occurs when one or more of three possible lifting agents – cyclonic frontal  convective  or orographic – causes air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point  the temperature at which the air becomes saturated  the main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic if the air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated  it normally sheds vapor it can no longer retain  which condenses into cloud  water vapor in saturated air is normally attracted to condensation nuclei such as dust and salt particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the and cyclonic lift occur when stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds over a wide area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable  in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform  cumuliform  or cumulonimbiform depending on the stability of the warm air mass just ahead of the agent is the convective upward motion of air caused by daytime solar heating at surface airmass instability allows for the formation of cumuliform clouds that can produce showers if the air is sufficiently on comparatively rare occasions  convective lift can be powerful enough to penetrate the tropopause and push the cloud top into the third source of lift is wind circulation forcing air over a physical barrier such as a mountain  orographic if the air is generally stable  nothing more than lenticular cap clouds will form  however  if the air becomes sufficiently moist and unstable  orographic showers or thunderstorms may with adiabatic cooling that requires a lifting agent  there are three major non-adiabatic  mechanisms for lowering the temperature of the air to its dew point  conductive  radiational  and evaporative cooling require no lifting mechanism and can cause condensation at surface level resulting in the formation of are several main sources of water vapor that can be added to the air as a way of achieving saturation without any cooling process  water or moist precipitation or and transpiration from the local distribution of clouds can be significantly influenced by topography  the global prevalence of cloud cover tends to vary more by latitude  it is most prevalent globally in and along low pressure zones of surface atmospheric convergence which encircle the earth close to the equator and near the 50th  parallels of latitude in the northern and southern the adiabatic cooling processes that lead to the creation of clouds by way of lifting agents are all associated with convergence  a process that involves the horizontal inflow and accumulation of air at a given location  as well as the rate at which this near the equator  increased cloudiness is due to the presence of the low-pressure  intertropical convergence zone  itcz  where very warm and unstable air promotes mostly cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds of virtually any type can form along the mid-latitude  convergence zones depending on the stability and moisture content of the air  these extratropical convergence zones are occupied by the polar fronts where air masses of polar origin meet and clash with those of tropical or subtropical this leads to the formation of weather-making  extratropical cyclones composed of cloud systems that may be stable or unstable to varying degrees according to the stability characteristics of the various airmasses that are in is the opposite of convergence  in the earth s atmosphere  it involves the horizontal outflow of air from the upper part of a rising column of air  or from the lower part of a subsiding column often associated with an area or ridge of high cloudiness tends to be least prevalent near the poles and in the subtropics close to the 20th  parallels  north and south  the latter are sometimes referred to as the horse latitudes  the presence of a large-scale  high-pressure  subtropical ridge on each side of the equator reduces cloudiness at these low latitudes  similar patterns also occur at higher latitudes in both hemispheres the luminance or brightness of a cloud is determined by how light is reflected  scattered  and transmitted by the cloud s particles  its brightness may also be affected by the presence of haze or photometeors such as halos and in the troposphere  dense  deep clouds exhibit a high reflectance (70%  to 95%)  throughout the visible spectrum  tiny particles of water are densely packed and sunlight cannot penetrate far into the cloud before it is reflected out  giving a cloud its characteristic white color  especially when viewed from the cloud droplets tend to scatter light efficiently  so that the intensity of the solar radiation decreases with depth into the gases  as a result  the cloud base can vary from a very light to very-dark-grey  depending on the cloud s thickness and how much light is being reflected or transmitted back to the observer  high thin tropospheric clouds reflect less light because of the comparatively low concentration of constituent ice crystals or supercooled water droplets which results in a slightly off-white  appearance  however  a thick dense ice-crystal  cloud appears brilliant white with pronounced grey shading because of its greater a tropospheric cloud matures  the dense water droplets may combine to produce larger droplets  if the droplets become too large and heavy to be kept aloft by the air circulation  they will fall from the cloud as rain  by this process of accumulation  the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger  permitting light to penetrate farther into the cloud  if the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart  a percentage of the light that enters the cloud is not reflected back out but is absorbed giving the cloud a darker look  a simple example of this is one s being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog  this process of reflection absorption is what causes the range of cloud color from white to cloud colorations can be seen at any altitude  with the color of a cloud usually being the same as the incident during daytime when the sun is relatively high in the sky  tropospheric clouds generally appear bright white on top with varying shades of grey underneath  thin clouds may look white or appear to have acquired the color of their environment or background  red  orange  and pink clouds occur almost entirely at sunrise sunset and are the result of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere  when the sun is just below the horizon  low-level  clouds are gray  middle clouds appear rose-colored,  and high clouds are white or off-white.  clouds at night are black or dark grey in a moonless sky  or whitish when illuminated by the moon  they may also reflect the colors of large fires  city lights  or auroras that might be cumulonimbus cloud that appears to have a greenish or bluish tint is a sign that it contains extremely high amounts of water  hail or rain which scatter light in a way that gives the cloud a blue color  a green colorization occurs mostly late in the day when the sun is comparatively low in the sky and the incident sunlight has a reddish tinge that appears green when illuminating a very tall bluish cloud  supercell type storms are more likely to be characterized by this but any storm can appear this way  coloration such as this does not directly indicate that it is a severe thunderstorm  it only confirms its potential  since a green blue tint signifies copious amounts of water  a strong updraft to support it  high winds from the storm raining out  and wet hail  all elements that improve the chance for it to become severe  can all be inferred from this  in addition  the stronger the updraft is  the more likely the storm is to undergo tornadogenesis and to produce large hail and high clouds may be seen in the troposphere in the late spring through early fall months during forest fire season  the yellow color is due to the presence of pollutants in the smoke  yellowish clouds are caused by the presence of nitrogen dioxide and are sometimes seen in urban areas with high air pollution stratiformis and small castellanus made orange by the sun risingan occurrence of cloud iridescence with

sun s angle enhance colors of stratocumulus cumulogenitus at evening twilightthe role of tropospheric clouds in regulating weather and climate remains a leading source of uncertainty in global warming this uncertainty arises because of the delicate balance of processes related to clouds  spanning scales from millimeters to planetary  hence  interactions between large-scale  weather events  synoptic meteorology  and clouds becomes difficult to represent in global models the complexity and diversity of clouds  as outlined above  adds to the problem  on the one hand  white-colored  cloud tops promote cooling of earth s surface by reflecting short-wave  radiation from the sun  most of the sunlight that reaches the ground is absorbed  warming the surface  which emits radiation upward at longer  infrared  wavelengths  at these wavelengths  however  water in the clouds acts as an efficient absorber  the water reacts by radiating  also in the infrared  both upward and downward  and the downward long-wave  radiation results in some warming at the surface  this is analogous to the greenhouse effect of greenhouse gases and water genus-types  particularly show this duality with both short-wave  albedo cooling and long-wave  greenhouse warming effects  on the whole though  ice-crystal  clouds in the upper troposphere tend to favor net however  the cooling effect is dominant with mid-level  and low clouds made of very small water droplets with an average radius of about 2  µm (0.00008  especially when they form in extensive sheets that block out more of the sun  small-droplet  aerosols are not good at absorbing long-wave  radiation reflected back from earth  so there is a net cooling with almost no long-wave  effect  this effect is particularly pronounced with low clouds that form over measurements taken by nasa indicate that on the whole  the effects of low and mid-level  clouds that tend to promote cooling are outweighing the warming effects of high layers and the variable outcomes associated with or vertically developed and vertical heaps of cumulus  towering cumulus  and cumulonimbus are made of larger water droplets ranging in radius from 5  to about 15  µm  nimbostratus cloud droplets can also be quite large  up to 15  µm these larger droplets associated with vertically developed clouds are better able to trap the long-wave  radiation thus mitigating the cooling effect to some degree  however  these large often precipitating clouds are variable or unpredictable in their overall effect because of variations in their concentration  distribution  and vertical extent as difficult as it is to evaluate the effects of current cloud cover characteristics on climate change  it is even more problematic to predict the outcome of this change with respect to future cloud patterns and events  as a consequence  much research has focused on the response of low and vertical clouds to a changing climate  leading global models can produce quite different results  however  with some showing increasing low-étage  clouds and others showing stratospheric clouds show little variation in structure and are limited to a single very high range of altitude of about 15,000–25,000  m (49,200–82,000  ft   so they are not classified into altitude levels  genus types  species  or varieties in the manner of tropospheric stratospheric clouds form in the lowest part of the stratosphere during the winter  at the altitude and during the season that produces the coldest temperatures and therefore the best chances of triggering condensation caused by adiabatic cooling  they are typically very thin with an undulating cirriform moisture is scarce in the stratosphere  so nacreous and non-nacreous  cloud at this altitude range is rare and is usually restricted to polar regions in the winter where the air is coldest polar mesospheric clouds form at a single extreme altitude range of about 80  to 85  km (50  to 53  mi  and are consequently not classified into more than one level  they are given the latin name noctilucent because of their illumination well after sunset and before sunrise  they typically have a bluish or silvery white coloration that can resemble brightly illuminated cirrus  noctilucent clouds may occasionally take on more of a red or orange they are not common or widespread enough to have a significant effect on however  an increasing frequency of occurrence of noctilucent clouds since the 19th  century may be the result of climate change noctilucent clouds are the highest in the atmosphere and form near the top of the mesosphere at about ten times the altitude of tropospheric high from ground level  they can occasionally be seen illuminated by the sun during deep twilight  ongoing research indicates that convective lift in the mesosphere is strong enough during the polar summer to cause adiabatic cooling of small amount of water vapour to the point of saturation  this tends to produce the coldest temperatures in the entire atmosphere just below the mesopause  these conditions result in the best environment for the formation of polar mesospheric there is also evidence that smoke particles from burnt-up  meteors provide much of the condensation nuclei required for the formation of noctilucent in the mesosphere is similar to the stratosphere except at much higher altitudes  because of the need for maximum cooling of the water vapor to produce noctilucent clouds  their distribution tends to be restricted to polar regions of earth  a major seasonal difference is that convective lift from below the mesosphere pushes very scarce water vapor to higher colder altitudes required for cloud formation during the respective summer seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres  sightings are rare more than 45  degrees south of the north pole or north of the south cover has been seen on most other planets in the solar system  venus s thick clouds are composed of sulfur dioxide  due to volcanic activity  and appear to be almost entirely they are arranged in three main layers at altitudes of 45  to 65  km that obscure the planet s surface and can produce virga  no embedded cumuliform types have been identified  but broken stratocumuliform wave formations are sometimes seen in the top layer that reveal more continuous layer clouds on mars  noctilucent  cirrus  cirrocumulus and stratocumulus composed of water-ice  have been detected mostly near the water-ice  fogs have also been detected on jupiter and saturn have an outer cirriform cloud deck composed of an intermediate stratiform haze-cloud  layer made of ammonium hydrosulfide  and an inner deck of cumulus water embedded cumulonimbus are known to exist near the great red spot on the same category-types  can be found covering uranus  and neptune  but are all composed of saturn s moon titan has cirrus clouds believed to be composed largely of the cassini–huygens saturn mission uncovered evidence of polar stratospheric and a fluid cycle on titan  including lakes near the poles and fluvial channels on the surface of the moon some planets outside the solar system are known to have atmospheric clouds  in october 2013,  the detection of high altitude optically thick clouds in the atmosphere of exoplanet kepler-7b  was and  in december 2013,  in the atmospheres of gj 436  b and gj 1214
