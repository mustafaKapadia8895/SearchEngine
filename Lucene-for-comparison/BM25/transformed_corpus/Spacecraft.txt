 spacecraft -  wikipediaa spacecraft is a vehicle or machine designed to fly in outer space  spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes  including communications  earth observation  meteorology  navigation  space colonization  planetary exploration  and transportation of humans and cargo on a sub-orbital  spaceflight  a spacecraft enters space and then returns to the surface  without having gone into an orbit  for orbital spaceflights  spacecraft enter closed orbits around the earth or around other celestial bodies  spacecraft used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or passengers from start or on orbit  space stations  only  whereas those used for robotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically  robotic spacecraft used to support scientific research are space probes  robotic spacecraft that remain in orbit around a planetary body are artificial satellites  only a handful of interstellar probes  such as pioneer 10  and 11,  voyager 1  and 2,  and new horizons  are on trajectories that leave the solar system orbital spacecraft may be recoverable or not  by method of reentry to earth they may be divided in non-winged  space capsules and winged spaceplanes humanity has achieved space flight but only a few nations have the technology for orbital launches  including  russia  rsa or  roscosmos    the united states  nasa   the member states of the european space agency  esa   japan  jaxa   iran  isa   india  isro   and china  cnsa  sputnik 1  was the first artificial satellite  it was launched into an elliptical low earth orbit  leo  by the soviet union on 4  october 1957.  the launch ushered in new political  military  technological  and scientific developments  while the sputnik launch was a single event  it marked the start of the space apart from its value as a technological first  sputnik 1  also helped to identify the upper atmospheric layer s density  through measuring the satellite s orbital changes  it also provided data on radio-signal  distribution in the ionosphere  pressurized nitrogen in the satellite s false body provided the first opportunity for meteoroid detection  sputnik 1  was launched during the international geophysical year from site no.1/5,  at the 5th  tyuratam range  in kazakh ssr  now at the baikonur cosmodrome   the satellite travelled at 29,000  kilometers (18,000  mi  per hour  taking 96.2  minutes to complete an orbit  and emitted radio signals at 20.005  and 40.002  mhzwhile sputnik 1  was the first spacecraft to orbit the earth  other man-made  objects had previously reached an altitude of 100  km  which is the height required by the international organization fédération aéronautique internationale to count as a spaceflight  this altitude is called the kármán line  in particular  in the 1940s  there were several test launches of the v-2  rocket  some of which reached altitudes well over 100  km as of 2016,  only three nations have flown manned spacecraft  ussr russia  usa  and china  the first manned spacecraft was vostok 1,  which carried soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin into space in 1961,  and completed a full earth orbit  there were five other manned missions which used a vostok the second manned spacecraft was named freedom 7,  and it performed a sub-orbital  spaceflight in 1961  carrying american astronaut alan shepard to an altitude of just over 187  kilometers (116  mi   there were five other manned missions using mercury spacecraft other soviet manned spacecraft include the voskhod  soyuz  flown unmanned as zond/l1,  l3,  tks  and the salyut and mir manned space stations  other american manned spacecraft include the gemini spacecraft  apollo spacecraft  the skylab space station  and the space shuttle with undetached european spacelab and private us spacehab space stations-modules.  china developed  but did not fly shuguang  and is currently using shenzhou  its first manned mission was in 2003).except  for the space shuttle  all of the recoverable manned orbital spacecraft were space capsules soviet vostok capsuleamerican mercury  gemini  and apollo spacecraftsoviet voskhod  variant of vostok)1967  soviet russian soyuz spacecraftchinese shenzhouthe international space station  manned since november 2000,  is a joint venture between russia  the united states  canada and several other countries some reusable vehicles have been designed only for manned spaceflight  and these are often called spaceplanes  the first example of such was the north american x-15  spaceplane  which conducted two manned flights which reached an altitude of over 100  km in the 1960s.  the first reusable spacecraft  the x-15,  was air-launched  on a suborbital trajectory on july 19,  1963.the  first partially reusable orbital spacecraft  a winged non-capsule,  the space shuttle  was launched by the usa on the 20th  anniversary of yuri gagarin s flight  on april 12,  1981.  during the shuttle era  six orbiters were built  all of which have flown in the atmosphere and five of which have flown in space  enterprise was used only for approach and landing tests  launching from the back of a boeing 747  sca and gliding to deadstick landings at edwards afb  california  the first space shuttle to fly into space was columbia  followed by challenger  discovery  atlantis  and endeavour  endeavour was built to replace challenger when it was lost in january 1986.  columbia broke up during reentry in february 2003.the  first automatic partially reusable spacecraft was the buran-class  shuttle  launched by the ussr on november 15,  1988,  although it made only one flight and this was unmanned  this spaceplane was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the u s  space shuttle  although its drop-off  boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the american shuttle  lack of funding  complicated by the dissolution of the ussr  prevented any further flights of buran  the space shuttle was subsequently modified to allow for autonomous re-entry  in case of necessity per the vision for space exploration  the space shuttle was retired in 2011  due mainly to its old age and high cost of program reaching over a billion dollars per flight  the shuttle s human transport role is to be replaced by space x s dragon v2  and boeing s cst-100  starliner no later than 2017.  the shuttle s heavy cargo transport role is to be replaced by expendable rockets such as the space launch system and spacex s falcon heavy scaled composites  spaceshipone was a reusable suborbital spaceplane that carried pilots mike melvill and brian binnie on consecutive flights in 2004  to win the ansari x prize  the spaceship company will build its successor spaceshiptwo  a fleet of spaceshiptwos operated by virgin galactic was planned to begin reusable private spaceflight carrying paying passengers in 2014,  but was delayed after the crash of vss enterprise a spacecraft system comprises various subsystems  depending on the mission profile  spacecraft subsystems comprise the spacecraft s  bus  and may include attitude determination and control  variously called adac  adc  or acs   guidance  navigation and control  gnc or gn c   communications  comms   command and data handling  cdh or c dh   power  eps   thermal control  tcs   propulsion  and structures  attached to the bus are typically payloads
