 atlantic hurricane season -  wikipediathe atlantic hurricane season is the period in a year when hurricanes usually form in the atlantic ocean  tropical cyclones in the north atlantic are called hurricanes  tropical storms  or tropical depressions  in addition  there have been several storms over the years that have not been fully tropical and are categorized as subtropical depressions and subtropical storms  even though subtropical storms and subtropical depressions are not technically as strong as tropical cyclones  the damages can still be devastating worldwide  tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer  when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest  however  each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns  on a worldwide scale  may is the least active month  while september is the most in the northern atlantic ocean  a distinct hurricane season occurs from june 1  to november 30,  sharply peaking from late august through the season s climatological peak of activity occurs around september 10  each this is the norm  but in 1938,  the atlantic hurricane season started as early as january 3.tropical  disturbances that reach tropical storm intensity are named from a pre-determined  list  on average  10.1  named storms occur each season  with an average of 5.9  becoming hurricanes and 2.5  becoming major hurricanes  category 3  or greater   the most active season was 2005,  during which 28  tropical cyclones formed  of which a record 15  became hurricanes  the least active season was 1914,  with only one known tropical cyclone developing during that the atlantic hurricane season is a time when most tropical cyclones are expected to develop across the northern atlantic ocean  it is currently defined as the time frame from june 1  through november 30,  though in the past the season was defined as a shorter time frame  during the season  regular tropical weather outlooks are issued by the national hurricane center  and coordination between the weather prediction center and national hurricane center occurs for systems which have not formed yet  but could develop during the next three to seven days the basic concept of a hurricane season began during when dedicated wire circuits known as hurricane circuits began to be set up along the gulf and atlantic a process completed by it was originally the time frame when the tropics were monitored routinely for tropical cyclone activity  and was originally defined as from june 15  through october over the years  the beginning date was shifted back to june 1,  while the end date was shifted to november before settling at november 30  by this was when hurricane reconnaissance planes were sent out to fly across the atlantic and gulf of mexico on a routine basis to look for potential tropical cyclones  in the years before the continuous weather satellite since regular satellite surveillance began  hurricane hunter aircraft fly only into storm areas which are first spotted by satellite the hurricane season  the national hurricane center routinely issues their tropical weather outlook product  which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones  if systems occur outside the defined hurricane season  special tropical weather outlooks will be routine coordination occurs at 1700  utc each day between the weather prediction center and national hurricane center to identify systems for the pressure maps three to seven days into the future within the tropics  and points for existing tropical cyclones six to seven days into the possible tropical cyclones are depicted with a closed isobar  while systems with less certainty to develop are depicted as  spot lows  with no isobar surrounding them the north atlantic hurricane database  or hurdat  is the database for all tropical storms and hurricanes for the atlantic ocean  gulf of mexico and caribbean sea  including those that have made landfall in the united states  the original database of six-hourly  positions and intensities were put together in the 1960s  in support of the apollo space program to help provide statistical track forecast guidance  in the intervening years  this database — which is now freely and easily accessible on the internet from the national hurricane center s  nhc  webpage — has been utilized for a wide variety of uses  climatic change studies  seasonal forecasting  risk assessment for county emergency managers  analysis of potential losses for insurance and business interests  intensity forecasting techniques and verification of official and various model predictions of track and intensity hurdat was not designed with all of these uses in mind when it was first put together and not all of them may be appropriate given its original motivation  hurdat contains numerous systematic as well as some random errors in the database  additionally  analysis techniques have changed over the years at nhc as their understanding of tropical cyclones has developed  leading to biases in the historical database  another difficulty in applying the hurricane database to studies concerned with landfalling events is the lack of exact location  time and intensity at hurricane landfall hurdat is regularly updated annually to reflect the previous season s activity  the older portion of the database has been regularly revised since 2001.  the first time in 2001  led to the addition of tropical cyclone tracks for the years 1851  to 1885.  the second time was august 2002  when hurricane andrew was upgraded to a category 5.  recent efforts into uncovering undocumented historical hurricanes in the late 19th  and 20th  centuries by various researchers have greatly increased our knowledge of these past events  possible changes for the years 1951  onward are not yet incorporated into the hurdat database  because of all of these issues  a re-analysis  of the atlantic hurricane database is being attempted that will be completed in three years in addition to the groundbreaking work by additional analyses  digitization and quality control of the data was carried out by researchers at the noaa hurricane research division funded by the noaa office of global programs  this re-analysis  will continue to progress through the remainder of the 20th  national hurricane center s best track change committee has approved changes for a few recent cyclones  such as hurricane andrew  official changes to the atlantic hurricane database are approved by the national hurricane center best track change committee  thus research conducted by chris landsea and colleagues as part of the atlantic hurricane database reanalysis project are submitted through this review process  not all landsea s recommendations are accepted by the committee note  in the following tables  all estimates of damage costs are expressed in contemporaneous us dollars  usd  note  in the following tables  all estimates of damage costs are expressed in contemporaneous us dollars  usd  this bar chart shows the number of named storms and hurricanes per year from 1851-2017.a  2011  study analyzing one of the main sources of hurricanes -  the african easterly wave  aew  -  found that the change in aews is closely linked to increased activity of intense hurricanes in the north atlantic  the synoptic concurrence of aews in driving the dynamics of the sahel greening also appears to increase tropical cyclogenesis over the north
