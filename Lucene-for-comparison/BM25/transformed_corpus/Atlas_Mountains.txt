 atlas mountains -  wikipediathe atlas mountains  arabic  جبال الأطلس‎‎  jibāl al-ʾaṭlas;  berber  ⵉⴷⵓⵔⴰⵔ ⵏ ⵡⴰⵟⵍⴰⵙ  idurar n waṭlas  are a mountain range in the maghreb  it stretches around 2,500  km (1,600  mi  through morocco  algeria and tunisia  the range s highest peak is toubkal  with an elevation of 4,167  metres (13,671  ft  in southwestern morocco  it separates the mediterranean and atlantic coastlines from the sahara the atlas mountains are primarily inhabited by berber the terms for  mountain  in some berber languages are adrar and adras  which are believed to be cognates of the toponym atlas the mountains are home to a number of plant and animal species unique in africa  often more like those of europe  many of them are endangered and some have already gone extinct  examples include the barbary macaque  the atlas bear  africa s only native bear  now extinct   the barbary leopard  the barbary stag  barbary sheep  the barbary lion  extinct in the wild   the atlas mountain badger  the north african elephant  extinct   the north african aurochs  extinct   cuvier s gazelle  the northern bald ibis  dippers  the atlas mountain viper  the atlas cedar  the european black pine  and the algerian oak the basement rock of most of africa was formed during the precambrian period  and is much older than the atlas mountains lying on the continent  the atlas was formed during three subsequent phases of earth s geology the first tectonic deformation phase involves only the anti-atlas,  which was formed in the paleozoic era (~300  million years ago  as the result of continental collisions  north america  europe and africa were connected millions of years ago the anti-atlas  mountains are believed to have originally been formed as part of alleghenian orogeny  these mountains were formed when africa and america collided  and were once a chain rivaling today s himalayas  today  the remains of this chain can be seen in the fall line region in the eastern united states  some remnants can also be found in the later formed appalachians in north america a second phase took place during the mesozoic era  before ~66  my   it consisted of a widespread extension of the earth s crust that rifted and separated the continents mentioned above  this extension was responsible for the formation of many thick intracontinental sedimentary basins including the present atlas  most of the rocks forming the surface of the present high atlas were deposited under the ocean at that time finally  in the paleogene and neogene periods (~66  million to ~1.8  million years ago   the mountain chains that today constitute the atlas were uplifted  as the land masses of europe and africa collided at the southern end of the iberian peninsula  such convergent tectonic boundaries occur where two plates slide towards each other forming a subduction zone  if one plate moves underneath the other   and or a continental collision  when the two plates contain continental crust   in the case of the africa-europe  collision  it is clear that tectonic convergence is partially responsible for the formation of the high atlas  as well as for the closure of the strait of gibraltar and the formation of the alps and the pyrenees  however  there is a lack of evidence for the nature of the subduction in the atlas region  or for the thickening of the earth s crust generally associated with continental collisions  in fact  one of the most striking features of the atlas to geologists is the relative small amount of crustal thickening and tectonic shortening despite the important altitude of the mountain range  recent studies suggest that deep processes rooted in the earth s mantle may have contributed to the uplift of the high and middle atlas are rich in natural resources  there are deposits of iron ore  lead ore  copper  silver  mercury  rock salt  phosphate  marble  anthracite coal and natural gas among other resources the range can be divided into four general regions the middle atlas is a portion of the atlas mountain range lying completely in morocco  the middle atlas is the westernmost of three atlas mountains chains that define a large  plateaued basin extending eastward  south of the middle atlas and separated by the moulouya and oum er-rbia  rivers  the high atlas stretches for 700  kilometres (430  mi  with a succession of peaks among which ten reach above 4,000  metres (13,000  ft   north of the middle atlas and separated by the sebou river  the rif mountains are an extension of the baetic cordillera  baetic mountains  which include the sierra nevada  in the south of spain the high atlas in central morocco rises in the west at the atlantic coast and stretches in an eastern direction to the moroccan-algerian  border  at the atlantic and to the southwest  the range drops abruptly and makes an impressive transition to the coast and the anti-atlas  range  to the north  in the direction of marrakesh  the range descends less abruptly on the heights of ouarzazate the massif is cut through by the draa valley which opens southward  it is mainly inhabited by berber people  who live in small villages and cultivate the high plains of the ourika valley near barrage cavagnac  there is a hydroelectric dam that has created the artificial lake lalla takerkoust  the lake serves also as a source for fish for the local fishermen the largest villages and towns of the area are ouarzazate  tahanaoute  amizmiz  imlil  tin mal and ijoukak the anti-atlas  extends from the atlantic ocean in the southwest of morocco toward the northeast to the heights of ouarzazate and further east to the city of tafilalt  altogether a distance of approximately 500  kilometres or 310  miles   in the south it borders the sahara  the easternmost point of the anti-atlas  is the jbel saghro range and its northern boundary is flanked by sections of the high atlas range  it includes the djebel siroua  a massif of volcanic origin with the highest summit of the range at 3,304  m  the jebel bani is a much lower range running along the southern side of the anti saharan atlas of algeria is the eastern portion of the atlas mountain range  though not as high as the grand atlas  they are far more imposing than the tell atlas range that runs to the north of them and closer to the coast  the highest peak in the range is the 2,236  m (7,336  ft  high djebel aissa  they mark the northern edge of the sahara desert  the mountains see some rainfall and are better suited to agriculture than the plateau region to the north  today most of the population of the region are berbers  imazighen  the tell atlas is a mountain chain over 1,500  kilometres (930  mi  in length  belonging to the atlas mountain ranges and stretching from morocco  through algeria to tunisia  it parallels the mediterranean coast  together with the saharan atlas to the south it forms the northernmost of two more or less parallel ranges which gradually approach one another towards the east  merging in eastern algeria  at the western ends at the middle atlas range in morocco  the area immediately to the south of this range is the high plateau of the hautes plaines  with lakes in the wet season and salt flats in the dry the aurès mountains of algeria and tunisia are the farthest eastern portion of the atlas mountain range  the aurès natural region is named after the
