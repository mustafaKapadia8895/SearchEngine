america   his predecessor  george percy  through inept leadership  was responsible for the lives lost during the period called the starving time  the english-born  gates arrived to find a few surviving starving colonists commanded by percy  and assumed command  gates ruled with deputy governor sir thomas dale  their controlled  strict methods helped the early colonies survive  however  they did not assist in making them thrive gates was appointed by the virginia company of london  which had established the jamestown settlement under a royal charter for the colonisation of virginia  he had sailed for jamestown in 1609,  aboard the sea venture  the new flagship of the virginia company  the sea venture was part of the third supply  a fleet of seven ships  towing two pinnacles  which was intended to deliver new settlers and desperately needed supplies at sea  the ships of the third supply were separated by a three-day  storm now thought to have been a large hurricane  the admiral of the virginia company  sir george somers  had taken the helm to fight the storm  and deliberately drove the ship onto rocks to prevent its foundering  the rocks proved to be the reef line to the east of the uninhabited archipelago now known as bermuda  the other ships went on to jamestown  not knowing the fate of the sea venture the 150  survivors spent the next ten months in bermuda building two new ships on which to complete the journey to jamestown  two factions developed  however  due to a dispute between gates and somers over who was now the superior  as an appointed officer for jamestown  gates felt he was in authority  now that they were ashore  somers felt that he retained authority until the settlers  including gates  were landed at jamestown  the two new ships  the deliverance and the patience were completed and sailed for virginia in 1610.  they left two men  a third would be left when the patience returned from jamestown  to maintain their claim of bermuda for england  the charter of the virginia company would officially be extended to include bermuda in 1612.ever  since  bermuda has also been known officially as the somers isles  sir thomas gates left his own name on a part of the colony  gate s bay  where the survivors of the sea venture landed  the oldest surviving fort in bermuda  built between 1612  and 1615,  is known as gate s fort  many scholars

of her leake  under a point that bore south east from the northerne point of the island which wee discovered first on the eighth and twentieth of july 1609.on  reaching jamestown  only 60  of the 500  settlers previously landed there were found alive through the winter of 1609–1610  which became known as the  starving time   the condition of the settlement was so poor that it was decided to abandon it and return everyone to england  however  the timely arrival of another relief fleet under lord de la warr gave the colony a reprieve  gates  actions as governor were recorded by his secretary william strachey  and were later published as the book  a true reportory of the wracke  and redemption of sir thomas gates  knight  after samuel argall kidnapped pocahontas in april 1613,  gates was fearful of reprisal from chief powhatan  and turned the algonquian princess over to dale in henricus  she met john rolfe during her captivity three months later  reverend alexander whitaker converted pocahontas to christianity  she adopted the name  rebecca  gates would go on to establish at least three new forts along the james river  as well as blockhouses  a wharf  and a governors house  gates would also lead an armed force against the powhatans  defeating them  and was governor when sir thomas dale established the first permanent english colony outside of jamestown  called henricus  gates  actions caused him to be considered a national hero upon his return to england  something the virginia company badly needed due to their previous dip in investors  gates was outspoken in support of future expeditions to the new world  and warned his superiors that the colonies would fail without proper supplies  in november 1619,  the virginia company s new treasurer  sir edwin sandys  praised gates   wisdom  industry  and valour  accompanied with exceeding paines and patience  in the midst of many difficulties  gates died in the netherlands sometime before september 7,  1622.  sir dudley
