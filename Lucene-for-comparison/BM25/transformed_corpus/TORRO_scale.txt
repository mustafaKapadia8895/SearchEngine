 torro scale -  wikipediathe torro tornado intensity scale  or t-scale)  is a scale measuring tornado intensity between t0  and t11.  it was proposed by terence meaden of the tornado and storm research organisation  torro   a meteorological organisation in the united kingdom  as an extension of the beaufort scale the scale was tested from 1972  to 1975  and was made public at a meeting of the royal meteorological society in 1975.  the scale sets t0  as the equivalent of 8  on the beaufort scale and is related to the beaufort scale  b  by the formula and conversely the beaufort scale was first introduced in 1805,  and in 1921  quantified  it expresses the wind speed  v  by the formula most uk tornadoes are t6  or below with the strongest known uk tornado being a t8.  for comparison  the strongest detected winds in a united states tornado  during the 1999  oklahoma tornado outbreak  would be t11  using the following formulae where v is wind speed and t is torro intensity number  wind speed is defined as a 3-second  gust at 10  m agl alternatively  the t-scale  formula may be expressed as ortorro claims it differs from the fujita scale in that it is  purely  a wind speed scale  whereas the fujita scale relies on damage for classification  but in practice  damage is utilised almost exclusively in both systems to infer intensity  that is because such a proxy for intensity is usually all that is available  although users of both scales would prefer direct  objective  quantitative measurements  the scale is primarily used in the united kingdom whereas the fujita scale is the primary scale used in north america  continental europe  and the rest of the world at the 2004  european conference on severe storms  dr  meaden proposed a unification of the torro and fujita scales as the tornado force or tf in 2007  in the united states  the enhanced fujita scale replaced the original fujita scale from it made substantial improvements in standardizing damage descriptors through expanding and refining damage indicators and associated degrees of damage  as well as calibrated tornado wind speeds to better match the associated however  the ef scale is biased to us construction needed   as of 2014,  only the united states and canada have adopted the ef with the f scale  no analyses have been undertaken at all to establish the veracity and accuracy of the t scale damage descriptors  the scale was written in the early 1970s,  and does not take into account changes such as the growth in weight of vehicles or the great reduction in numbers and change of type of railway needed  and was written in an environment where tornadoes of f2  or stronger are extremely rare  so little or no first-hand  investigation of actual damage at the upper end of the scale was possible  the torro scale has more graduations than the f scale which makes it arguably more useful for tornadoes on the lower end of the needed   however  such accuracy and precision are not typically attainable in practice  brooks and doswell stated that  the problems associated with damage surveys and uncertainties associated with estimating wind speed from observed damage make highly precise assignments in survey reports  fujita ratings sometimes also have extra qualifications added   minimal f2"  or "upper-end  f3  damage    made by investigators who have experience of many similar tornadoes and relating to the fact that the f scale is a damage scale  not a wind speed needed tornadoes are rated after they have passed and have been examined  not whilst in progress  in rating the intensity of a tornado  both direct measurements and inferences from empirical observations of the effects of a tornado are used  few anemometers are struck by a tornado  and even fewer survive  so there are very few in-situ  measurements  therefore  almost all ratings are obtained from remote sensing techniques or as proxies from damage surveys  weather radar is used when available  and sometimes photogrammetry or videogrammetry estimates wind speed by measuring tracers in the vortex  in most cases  aerial and ground damage surveys of structures and vegetation are utilised  sometimes with engineering analysis  also sometimes available are ground swirl patterns  cycloidal marks  left in the wake of a tornado  if an on site analysis is not possible  either for retrospective ratings or when personnel cannot reach a site  photographs  videos  or descriptions of damage may be utilised the 12  categories for the torro scale are listed below  in order of increasing intensity  although the wind speeds and photographic damage examples are updated  which are more or less still needed  however  for the actual torro scale in practice  damage indicators  the type of structure which has been damaged  are predominantly used in determining the tornado intensity no damage to structures  unless on tops of tallest towers  or to radiosondes  balloons  and aircraft  no damage in the country  except possibly agitation to highest tree-tops  and effect on birds and smoke  record fc when not known to have reached ground level  a whistling or rushing sound aloft may be noticed loose light litter raised from ground-level  in spirals  tents  marquees seriously disturbed  most exposed tiles  slates on roofs dislodged  twigs snapped  trail visible through crops deckchairs  small plants  heavy litter becomes airborne  minor damage to sheds  more serious dislodging of tiles  slates  chimney pots  wooden fences flattened  slight damage to hedges and trees heavy mobile homes displaced  light caravans blown over  garden sheds destroyed  garage roofs torn away  much damage to tiled roofs and chimney stacks  general damage to trees  some big branches twisted or snapped off  small trees uprooted mobile homes overturned   badly damaged  light caravans destroyed  garages and weak outbuildings destroyed  house roof timbers considerably exposed  some of the bigger trees snapped or uprooted motor cars levitated  mobile homes airborne   destroyed  sheds airborne for considerable distances  entire roofs removed from some houses  roof timbers of stronger brick or stone houses completely exposed  gable ends torn away  numerous trees uprooted or snapped heavy motor vehicles levitated  more serious building damage than for t4,  yet house walls usually remaining  the oldest  weakest buildings may collapse completely strongly built houses lose entire roofs and perhaps also a wall  windows broken on skyscrapers  more of the less-strong  buildings collapse.wooden-frame  houses wholly demolished  some walls of stone or brick houses beaten down or collapse  skyscrapers twisted  steel-framed  warehouse-type  constructions may buckle

brick houses irreparably damaged  skyscrapers badly twisted and may show a visible lean to one side  shallowly anchored high rises may be toppled  other steel-framed  buildings buckled  (2008  poland

houses and similar buildings lifted bodily or completely from foundations and carried a long or large distance to disintegrate  steel-reinforced  concrete buildings may be severely damaged or almost obliterated strong framed  well built houses leveled off foundations and swept away  steel-reinforced  concrete structures are critically damaged  tall buildings collapse or have severe structural
