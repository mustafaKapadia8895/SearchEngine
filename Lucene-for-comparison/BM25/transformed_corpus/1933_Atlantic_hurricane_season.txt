 1933  atlantic hurricane season -  wikipediathe 1933  atlantic hurricane season was the second most active atlantic hurricane season on record  with 20  storms forming in the northwest atlantic ocean  breaking the record set by 1887.  the season ran through the summer and the first half of fall in 1933,  with activity as early as may and as late as november  a tropical cyclone was active for all but 13  days from june 28  to october 7.  the year was surpassed in total number of tropical cyclones by the 2005  season  which broke the record with 28  storms  tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes  especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration  may have remained undetected  because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s,  historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable  compensating for the lack of comprehensive observation  one hurricane researcher estimates the season could have produced 24  tropical the 20  storms during the season  11  attained hurricane status  six of those were major hurricanes  with sustained winds of over 111  mph (179  km h   two of the hurricanes reached winds of 160  mph (260  km h   which is a category 5–the  highest of 5–  on the modern saffir-simpson  hurricane 1]  the season produced several deadly storms  with eight storms killing more than 20  people  all but 3  of the 20  known storms affected land at some point during their durations the 1933  season was the most active of its time  surpassing the previous record-holder  of 19  storms in 1887.  fifteen of the season s storms made landfall as tropical cyclones  and another struck land as an extratropical storm  eight tropical storms  including six hurricanes  hit the united states during the season  including the chesapeake–potomac hurricane  which the u s  weather bureau described as one of the most severe in history along the mid-atlantic  states  seven tropical storms  including four hurricanes  hit mexico  two of which caused severe damage in the tampico season was continuously active  with six storms forming during the month of august at the time  many storms received the distinction of being the earliest nth storm to form  such as the earliest fifth tropical storm to form in a season  most of the records were broken in later during the season  the u s  weather bureau issued storm and hurricane warnings for eight storms  including coastal portions of texas  as well as from florida to massachusetts  forcing the evacuations of thousands of people  the deadliest storm of the season was a hurricane that struck tampico  mexico  killing over 184  residents  the costliest hurricane was the chesapeake–potomac hurricane  which caused $27  million in damage from north carolina to new 2]  the hurricane produced rainfall that resulted in severe crop damage in addition to the 20  tropical storms  there were several tropical depressions of lesser intensity  the first developed on june 1  in the northwest caribbean and dissipated a few days later  another depression developed on july 11  over panama and also quickly dissipated  a tropical depression developed on july 17  in the northeastern atlantic west of the azores  and one ship reported hurricane-force  winds  however  there was little evidence that the tropical system was organized  so it was not classified as a tropical storm  originally  there was a tropical storm in the database in the caribbean in the middle of august  but it was downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of any reports of gale-force  winds  similarly  there was a tropical storm in the database in late september  but it was also downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of gale-force  season produced the highest accumulated cyclone energy  ace  on record with a total of 259.  the measurement is a method to compare tropical cyclone activity between seasons  originally  1933  had an ace of which was surpassed by 1950  and however  the atlantic hurricane reanalysis project found that the storms in 1933  were stronger than initially first storm of the season formed on may 14  in the southwestern caribbean sea off the east coast of nicaragua  it moved quickly to the north-northwest,  passing just northeast of the eastern tip of honduras  on may 15,  the storm turned to the west and entered the gulf of mexico while moving around the yucatán peninsula  the next day  it attained peak winds of 50  mph (85  km h   based on a ship report  turning southward  the storm made landfall on ciudad del carmen in mexico early on may 19  with winds of 40  mph (64  km h   it dissipated over land later that westward-moving  tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on june 24  about halfway between the southern lesser antilles and the coast of africa  the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm  and by june 27  it became a hurricane off the northern coast of guyana  at 2100  utc that day  the hurricane struck extreme southern trinidad with winds of 85  mph (137  km h   after crossing the island  the hurricane moved across the paria peninsula in northeastern venezuela with the same the hurricane was earliest to affect the region on record  and was the first storm in over 50  years to affected trinidad and venezuela  in trinidad  13  people were killed  about 1,000  people were left homeless  and damage was estimated at $3  million  in venezuela  the hurricane caused power outages  destroyed several houses  and killed several crossing venezuela into the eastern caribbean  the hurricane moved northwestward and gradually intensified  on july 3  it struck western cuba with winds of 100  mph (160  in the country  the storm killed 22  people  while damage amounted to $4  a building high pressure area turned the hurricane westward in the gulf of and after further strengthening the storm attained

hitting the mexican state of quintana roo  as it crossed the yucatán peninsula the cyclone weakened and eventually crossed into the bay of campeche  it moved quickly to the northwest  and made landfall near matagorda bay  in texas on july 23  as a 45  mph (70  km h  tropical storm  the system turned to the northeast  and became extratropical to the east of dallas  texas  the extratropical system moved slowly through northern louisiana  turned to the northeast  and dissipated over northeastern arkansas near memphis  passing near jamaica  the storm dropped heavy rainfall  including 9  inches (230  mm  in kingston which led to flooding and washouts  the rainfall also damaged several bridges and roads and resulting in delays in train mudslides and overflowing rivers flooded several towns with knee-deep  waters  moderate winds downed several banana trees across the prior to the arrival of the storm in texas  numerous coastal residents boarded up their houses and businesses and voluntarily evacuated further inland  upon making landfall  the storm produced high in eastern texas and western louisiana  the system dropped very heavy precipitation  which in places reached accumulations exceeding 20  inches (500  mm   the highest storm total occurred in logansport  louisiana  which reported 21.30  inches (541  mm  in a 4-day  in louisiana  the flooding severely damaged crops and forced about 250  families near shreveport to evacuate their flooded homes  the torrential rainfall also resulted in overflowing rivers  numerous highways  roads  and railroads were either impassable or closed  with some locations experiencing water depths of up to 20  feet (6.1  total damage reached nearly $2  dissipating cold front spawned a tropical depression east of bermuda on july
