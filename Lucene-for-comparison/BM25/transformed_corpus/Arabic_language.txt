 arabic -  wikipediaarabic  arabic  العَرَبِيَّة‎‎  al-ʻarabiyyah    listen  or arabic  عَرَبِيّ‎‎ ʻarabī   listen  or is a central semitic language that first emerged in iron age northwestern arabia and is now the lingua franca of the arab it is named after the arabs  a term initially used to describe peoples living from mesopotamia in the east to the anti-lebanon  mountains in the west  in northwestern arabia  and in the sinai peninsula the modern written language  modern standard arabic  is derived from classical arabic  it is widely taught in schools and universities  and is used to varying degrees in workplaces  government  and the media  the two formal varieties are grouped together as literary arabic  fuṣḥā   which is the official language of 26  states and the liturgical language of islam  modern standard arabic largely follows the grammatical standards of classical arabic and uses much of the same vocabulary  however  it has discarded some grammatical constructions and vocabulary that no longer have any counterpart in the spoken varieties  and has adopted certain new constructions and vocabulary from the spoken varieties  much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the post-classical  era  especially in modern times during the middle ages  literary arabic was a major vehicle of culture in europe  especially in science  mathematics and philosophy  as a result  many european languages have also borrowed many words from it  arabic influence  mainly in vocabulary  is seen in european languages  mainly spanish and to a lesser extent portuguese  valencian and catalan  owing to both the proximity of christian european and muslim arab civilizations and 800  years of arabic culture and language in the iberian peninsula  referred to in arabic as al-andalus.  sicilian has about 500  arabic words as result of sicily being progressively conquered by saracens from north africa  from the mid 9th  to mid 10th  centuries  many of these words relate to agriculture and related activities  hull and ruffino   balkan languages  including greek and bulgarian  have also acquired a significant number of arabic words through contact with ottoman turkish arabic has influenced many languages around the globe throughout its history  some of the most influenced languages are persian  turkish  spanish  maltese  urdu  kashmiri  kurdish  bosnian  kazakh  bengali  hindi  malay  maldivian  indonesian  pashto  punjabi  tagalog  sindhi and hausa and some languages in parts of africa  conversely  arabic has borrowed words from other languages including greek and persian in medieval times  and contemporary european languages such as english and french in modern times classical arabic is the liturgical language of 1.7  billion muslims and modern standard arabic is one of six official languages of the united it is spoken by perhaps as many as 422  million speakers  native and non-native)  in the arab making it the fifth most spoken language in the world  arabic is written with the arabic alphabet  which is an abjad script and is written from right to left  although the spoken varieties are sometimes written in ascii latin from left to right with no standardized orthography arabic is a central semitic language  closely related to the northwest semitic languages  aramaic  hebrew  ugaritic and phoenician   the ancient south arabian languages  and various other semitic languages of arabia such as dadanitic  the semitic languages changed a great deal between proto-semitic  and the establishment of the central semitic languages  particularly in grammar  innovations of the central semitic languages—all maintained in arabic—include there are several features which classical arabic  the modern arabic varieties  as well as the safaitic and hismaic inscriptions share which are unattested in any other central semitic language variety  including the dadanitic and taymanitic languages of the northern hijaz  these features are evidence of common descent from a hypothetical ancestor  proto-arabic.  the following features can be reconstructed with confidence for boasted a wide variety of semitic languages in antiquity  in the southwest  various central semitic languages both belonging to and outside of the ancient south arabian family  e g  southern thamudic  were spoken  it is also believed that the ancestors of the modern south arabian languages (non-central  semitic languages  were also spoken in southern arabia at this time  to the north  in the oases of northern hijaz  dadanitic and taymanitic held some prestige as inscriptional languages  in najd and parts of western arabia  a language known to scholars as thamudic c is attested  in eastern arabia  inscriptions in a script derived from asa attest to a language known as hasaitic  finally  on the northwestern frontier of arabia  various languages known to scholars as thamudic b  thamudic d  safaitic  and hismaic are attested  the last two share important isoglosses with later forms of arabic  leading scholars to theorize that safaitic and hismaic are in fact early forms of arabic and that they should be considered old in the 1st  century ce  fragments of northern old arabic are attested in the nabataean script across northern arabia  by the 4th  century ce  the nabataean aramaic writing system had come to express varieties of arabic other than that of the nabataeans in late pre-islamic  times  a transdialectal and transcommunal variety of arabic emerged in the hijaz which continued living its parallel life after literary arabic had been institutionally standardized in the 2nd  and 3rd  century of the hijra  most strongly in judeo-christian  texts  keeping alive ancient features eliminated from the  learned  tradition  classical this variety and both its classicizing and  lay  iterations have been termed middle arabic in the past  but they are thought to continue an old higazi register  it is clear that the orthography of the qur ān was not developed for the standardized form of classical arabic  rather  it shows the attempt on the part of writers to record an archaic form of old higazi in the late 6th  century ad  a relatively uniform intertribal  poetic koine  distinct from the spoken vernaculars developed based on the bedouin dialects of najd  probably in connection with the court of al-ḥīra.  during the first islamic century  the majority of arabic poets and arabic-writing  persons spoke arabic as their mother tongue  their texts  although mainly preserved in far later manuscripts  contain traces of non-standardized  classical arabic elements in morphology and syntax  the standardization of classical arabic reached completion around the end of the 8th  century  the first comprehensive description of the ʿarabiyya  arabic   sībawayhi s al-kitāb,  is based first of all upon a corpus of poetic texts  in addition to qur ān usage and bedouin informants whom he considered to be reliable speakers of the by the 8th  century  knowledge of classical arabic had become an essential prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the islamic world charles ferguson s koine theory  ferguson 1959)  claims that the modern arabic dialects collectively descend from a single military koine that sprang up during the islamic conquests  this view has been challenged in recent times  ahmad al-jallad  proposes that there were at least two considerably distinct types of arabic on the eve of the conquests  northern and central (al-jallad  2009).  the modern dialects emerged from a new contact situation produced following the conquests  instead of the emergence of a single or multiple koines  the dialects contain several sedimentary layers of borrowed and areal features  which they absorbed at different points in their linguistic according to veersteegh and bickerton  colloquial arabic dialects arose from pidginized arabic formed from contact between arabs and conquered peoples  pidginization and subsequent creolization among arabs and arabized peoples could explain relative morphological and phonological simplicity of vernacular arabic compared to classical and usually designates one of three main variants  classical arabic  modern standard arabic and colloquial or dialectal arabic  classical arabic is the language found in the quran  used from the period of pre-islamic  arabia to that of the abbasid caliphate  theoretically  classical arabic is considered normative  according to the syntactic and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians  such as sibawayh  and the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries  such as the lisān al-ʻarab).  in practice  however  modern authors almost never write in pure classical arabic  instead using a literary language with its own grammatical norms and vocabulary  commonly known as modern standard arabic  msa  msa is the variety used in most current  printed arabic publications  spoken by some of the arabic media across north africa  and the middle east  and understood by most educated arabic speakers   literary arabic  and  standard arabic   فُصْحَى fuṣḥá  are less strictly defined terms that may refer to modern standard arabic or classical arabic some of the differences between classical arabic  ca  and modern standard arabic  msa  are as follows msa uses much classical vocabulary  e g   dhahaba  to go   that is not present in the spoken varieties  but deletes classical words that sound obsolete in msa  in addition  msa has borrowed or coined a large number of terms for concepts that did not exist in quranic times  and msa continues to some words have been borrowed from other languages—notice that transliteration mainly indicates spelling and not real pronunciation  e g   فِلْم film  film  or ديمقراطية dīmuqrāṭiyyah  democracy   however  the current preference is to avoid direct borrowings  preferring to either use loan translations  e g   فرع farʻ  branch   also used for the branch of a company or organization  جناح janāḥ  wing   is also used for the wing of an airplane  building  air force  etc    or to coin new words using forms within existing roots  استماتة istimātah  apoptosis   using the root موت m w t  death  put into the xth form  or جامعة jāmiʻah  university   based on جمع jamaʻa  to gather  unite   جمهورية jumhūriyyah  republic   based on جمهور jumhūr  multitude    an earlier tendency was to redefine an older word although this has fallen into disuse  e g   هاتف hātif  telephone     invisible caller  in sufism    جريدة jarīdah  newspaper    'palm-leaf  stalk   colloquial or dialectal arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties which constitute the everyday spoken language and evolved from classical arabic  colloquial arabic has many regional variants  geographically distant varieties usually differ enough to be mutually unintelligible  and some linguists consider them distinct the varieties are typically unwritten  they are often used in informal spoken media  such as soap operas and talk as well as occasionally in certain forms of written media such as poetry and printed advertising the only variety of modern arabic to have acquired official language status is maltese  which is spoken in  predominately catholic  malta and written with the latin script  it is descended from classical arabic through siculo-arabic,  but is not mutually intelligible with any other variety of arabic  most linguists list it as a separate language rather than as a dialect of arabic even during muhammad s lifetime  there were dialects of spoken arabic  muhammad spoke in the dialect of mecca  in the western arabian peninsula  and it was in this dialect that the quran was written down  however  the dialects of the eastern arabian peninsula were considered the most prestigious at the time  so the language of the quran was ultimately converted to follow the eastern phonology  it is this phonology that underlies the modern pronunciation of classical arabic  the phonological differences between these two dialects account for some of the complexities of arabic writing  most notably the writing of the glottal stop or hamzah  which was preserved in the eastern dialects but lost in western speech  and the use of alif maqṣūrah  representing a sound preserved in the western dialects but merged with ā in eastern needed the sociolinguistic situation of arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia  which is the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language  usually in different social situations  in the case of arabic  educated arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their school-taught  standard arabic as well as their native  mutually unintelligible these dialects linguistically constitute separate languages which may have dialects of their when educated arabs of different dialects engage in conversation  for example  a moroccan speaking with a lebanese   many speakers code-switch  back and forth between the dialectal and standard varieties of the language  sometimes even within the same sentence  arabic speakers often improve their familiarity with other dialects via music or film the issue of whether arabic is one language or many languages is politically charged  in the same way it is for the varieties of chinese  hindi and urdu  serbian and croatian  scots and english  etc  in contrast to speakers of hindi and urdu who claim they cannot understand each other even when they can  speakers of the varieties of arabic will claim they can all understand each other even when they the issue of diglossia between spoken and written language is a significant complicating factor  a single written form  significantly different from any of the spoken varieties learned natively  unites a number of sometimes divergent spoken forms  for political reasons  arabs mostly assert that they all speak a single language  despite significant issues of mutual incomprehensibility among differing spoken a linguistic standpoint  it is often said that the various spoken varieties of arabic differ among each other collectively about as much as the romance this is an apt comparison in a number of ways  the period of divergence from a single spoken form is similar—perhaps 1500  years for arabic  2000  years for the romance languages  also  while it is comprehensible to people from the maghreb  a linguistically innovative variety such as moroccan arabic is essentially incomprehensible to arabs from the mashriq  much as french is incomprehensible to spanish or italian speakers but relatively easily learned by them  this suggests that the spoken varieties may linguistically be considered separate languages the influence of arabic has been most important in islamic countries  because it is the language of the islamic sacred book  the quran  arabic is also an important source of vocabulary for languages such as baluchi  bengali  berber  bosnian  catalan  chechen  dagestani  english  french  german  gujarati  hausa  hindustani  italian  indonesian  kazakh  kurdish  kutchi  malay  pashto  persian  portuguese  punjabi  rohingya  saraiki  sicilian  sindhi  somali  spanish  swahili  tagalog  turkish  uzbek  and wolof  as well as other languages in countries where these languages are needed in addition  english has many arabic loanwords  some directly  but most via other mediterranean languages  examples of such words include admiral  adobe  alchemy  alcohol  algebra  algorithm  alkaline  almanac  amber  arsenal  assassin  candy  carat  cipher  coffee  cotton  ghoul  hazard  jar  kismet  lemon  loofah  magazine  mattress  sherbet  sofa  sumac  tariff  and many other needed  other languages such as and kinubi derive ultimately from arabic  rather than merely borrowing vocabulary or grammatical rules terms borrowed range from religious terminology  like berber taẓallit   prayer   from salat  صلاة ṣalāh    academic terms  like uyghur mentiq   logic    and economic items  like english coffee  to placeholders  like spanish fulano  "so-and-so"),  everyday terms  like hindustani lekin   but   or spanish taza and french tasse  meaning  cup    and expressions  like catalan a betzef   galore  in quantity    most berber varieties  such as kabyle   along with swahili  borrow some numbers from arabic  most islamic religious terms are direct borrowings from arabic  such as صلاة  salat    prayer   and إمام  imam    prayer leader  in languages not directly in contact with the arab world  arabic loanwords are often transferred indirectly via other languages rather than being transferred directly from arabic  for example  most arabic loanwords in hindustani and turkish entered through persian though persian is an indo-iranian  language  older arabic loanwords in hausa were borrowed from kanuri some words in english and other european languages are derived from arabic  often through other european languages  especially spanish and italian  among them are commonly used words like  coffee   قهوة qahwah    cotton   قطن quṭn   and  magazine   مخازن makhāzin   english words more recognizably of arabic origin include  algebra    alcohol    alchemy    alkali    zenith   and  nadir  arabic words also made their way into several west african languages as islam spread across the sahara  variants of arabic words such as كتاب kitāb   book   have spread to the languages of african groups who had no direct contact with arab throughout the islamic world  arabic occupied a position similar to that of latin in europe  many of the arabic concepts in the fields of science  philosophy  commerce  etc  were coined from arabic roots by non-native  arabic speakers  notably by aramaic and persian translators  and then found their way into other languages  this process of using arabic roots  especially in kurdish and persian  to translate foreign concepts continued through to the 18th  and 19th  centuries  when swaths of arab-inhabited  lands were under ottoman rule the most important sources of borrowings into (pre-islamic)  arabic are from the related  semitic  languages which used to be the principal  international language of communication throughout the ancient near and middle east  ethiopic  and to a lesser degree hebrew  mainly religious concepts   in addition  many cultural  religious and political terms have entered arabic from iranian languages  notably middle persian  parthian  and  classical  and hellenistic greek  kīmiyāʼ has as origin the greek khymia  meaning in that language the melting of metals  see roger dachez  histoire de la médecine de l antiquité au xxe siècle  tallandier  2008,  p  251),  alembic  distiller  from ambix  cup   almanac  climate  from almenichiakon  calendar    for the origin of the last three borrowed words  see alfred-louis  de prémare  foundations of islam  seuil  l univers historique  2002.)  some arabic borrowings from semitic or persian languages are  as presented in de prémare s above-cited  book there have been many instances of national movements to convert arabic script into latin script or to romanize the language  currently  the only arabic language to use latin script is maltese the beirut newspaper la syrie pushed for the change from arabic script to latin letters in 1922.  the major head of this movement was louis massignon  a french orientalist  who brought his concern before the arabic language academy in damacus in 1928.  massignon s attempt at romanization failed as the academy and population viewed the proposal as an attempt from the western world to take over their country  sa id afghani  a member of the academy  mentioned that the movement to romanize the script was a zionist plan to dominate the period of colonialism in egypt  egyptians were looking for a way to reclaim and re-emphasize  egyptian culture  as a result  some egyptians pushed for an egyptianization of the arabic language in which the formal arabic and the colloquial arabic would be combined into one language and the latin alphabet would be there was also the idea of finding a way to use hieroglyphics instead of the latin alphabet  but this was seen as too complicated to a scholar  salama musa agreed with the idea of applying a latin alphabet to arabic  as he believed that would allow egypt to have a closer relationship with the west  he also believed that latin script was key to the success of egypt as it would allow for more advances in science and technology  this change in alphabet  he believed  would solve the problems inherent with arabic  such as a lack of written vowels and difficulties writing foreign words that made it difficult for non-native  speakers to ahmad lutfi as sayid and muhammad azmi  two egyptian intellectuals  agreed with musa and supported the push for the idea that romanization was necessary for modernization and growth in egypt continued with abd al-aziz  fahmi in 1944.  he was the chairman for the writing and grammar committee for the arabic language academy of however  this effort failed as the egyptian people felt a strong cultural tie to the arabic in particular  the older egyptian generations believed that the arabic alphabet had strong connections to arab values and history  which is easy to believe due to the long history of the arabic alphabet  shrivtiel  189)  in muslim societies the quran introduced a new way of writing to the world  people began studying applying the unique styles they learned from the quran into not only their own writing  but also their culture  the deep level on which the quran addresses the reader creates a strong bond and connection to the reader s soul  writers studied the unique structure and format of the quran in order to identify and apply the figurative devices and their impact on the reader the quran inspired musicality in poetry through the internal rhythm of the verses  the arrangement of words  how certain sounds create harmony  and the agreement of rhymes create the sense of rhythm within each verse  at times  the chapters of the quran only have the rhythm in repetition in the quran introduced the true power and impact repetition can have in poetry  the repetition of certain words and phrases made them appear more firm and explicit in the quran  the quran uses constant metaphors of blindness and deafness to imply unbelief  metaphors were not a new concept to poetry  however the strength of extended metaphors was  the explicit imagery in the quran inspired many poets to include and focus on the feature in their own work  the poet ibn al mu tazz wrote a book regarding the figures of speech inspired by his study of the quran  opoets such as badr shakir al sayyab expresses his political opinion in his work through imagery inspired by the forms of more harsher imagery used in the the quran uses figurative devices in order to express the meaning in the most beautiful form possible  the study of the pauses in the quran as well as other rhetoric allow it to be approached in a multiple the quran is known for its fluency and harmony  the structure can be best described as chaotic  the suras also known as verses of the quran are not placed in chronological order  the only constant in their structure is that the longest are placed first and shorter ones follow  the topics discussed in the chapter often have no relation to each other and only share their sense of rhyme  the quran introduces to poetry the idea of abandoning order and scattering narratives throughout the text  harmony is also present in the sound of the quran  the elongations and accents present in the quran create a harmonious flow within the writing  unique sound of the quran recited  due to the accents  create a deeper level of understanding through a deeper emotional quran is written in a language that is simple and understandable by people  the simplicity of the writing inspired later poets to write in a more clear and clear-cut  the words of the quran  although unchanged  are to this day understandable and frequently used in both formal and informal arabic  the simplicity of the language makes memorizing and reciting the quran a slightly easier task the writer al-khattabi  explains how culture is a required element to create a sense of art in work as well as understand it  he believes that fluency and harmony the quran possess are not the only elements that make it beautiful and create a bond between the reader and the text  while a lot of poetry was deemed comparable to the quran in that it is equal to or better than the composition of the quran  a debate rose that such statements are not possible because humans are incapable of composing work comparable to the because the structure of the quran made it difficult for a clear timeline to be seen  hadith were the main source of chronological order  the hadith were passed down from generation to generation and this tradition became a large resource for understanding the context  poetry after the quran began possessing this element of tradition by including ambiguity and background information to be required to understand the the quran came down to the people  the tradition of memorizing the verses became present  it is believed that the larger amount of the quran memorized is a sign of a stronger faith  as technology improved overtime  hearing recitations of quran became more available as well as more tools to help memorize the versus  the tradition of love poetry served as a symbolic representation of a muslim s desire for a closer contact with their lord while the influence of the quran on arabic poetry is explained and defended by numerous writers  some writers such as al-  baqillani believe that poetry and the quran are in no conceivable way related due to the uniqueness of the quran  poetry s imperfections prove his points that that they cannot be compared with the fluency the quran holds classical arabic is the language of poetry and literature  including news   it is also mainly the language of the quran  at present  modern standard arabic  msa  is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the quran  arabic is closely associated with the religion of islam because the quran was written in arabic  but it is nevertheless also spoken by other religious groups such as arab christians  mizrahi jews  druze and iraqi mandaeans  most of the world s muslims do not speak classical arabic as their native language  but many can read the quranic script and recite the quran  among non-arab  muslims  translations of the quran are most often accompanied by the original text some muslims present a monogenesis of languages and claim that the arabic language was the language revealed by god for the benefit of mankind and the original language as a prototype system of symbolic communication  based upon its system of triconsonantal roots  spoken by man from which all other languages were derived  having first been judaism has a similar account with the tower of babel colloquial arabic is a collective term for the spoken dialects of arabic used throughout the arab world  which differ radically from the literary language  the main dialectal division is between the varieties within and outside of the arabian peninsula  followed by that between sedentary varieties and the much more conservative bedouin varieties  all of the varieties outside of the arabian peninsula  which include the large majority of speakers  have a large number of features in common with each other that are not found in classical arabic  this has led researchers to postulate the existence of a prestige koine dialect in the one or two centuries immediately following the arab conquest  whose features eventually spread to all of the newly conquered areas   these features are present to varying degrees inside the arabian peninsula  generally  the arabian peninsula varieties have much more diversity than the non-peninsula  varieties  but have been understudied  within the non-peninsula  varieties  the largest difference is between the non-egyptian  north african dialects  especially moroccan arabic  and the others  moroccan arabic in particular is hardly comprehensible to arabic speakers east of libya  although the converse is not true  in part due to the popularity of egyptian films and other media  one factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas  which have typically provided a significant number of new words and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order  however  a much more significant factor for most dialects is  as among romance languages  retention  or change of meaning  of different classical forms  thus iraqi aku  levantine fīh and north african kayən all mean  there is   and all come from classical arabic forms  yakūn  fīhi  kā in respectively   but now sound very different transcription is a broad ipa transcription  so minor differences were ignored for easier comparison  also  the pronunciation of modern standard arabic differs significantly from region to region according to charles a  the following are some of the characteristic features of the koine that underlies all of the modern dialects outside the arabian peninsula  although many other features are common to most or all of these varieties  ferguson believes that these features in particular are unlikely to have evolved independently more than once or twice and together suggest the existence of the koine of the 29  proto-semitic  consonants  only one has been lost  needed  which merged with but the consonant   ʒ  is still found in many colloquial arabic dialects  various other consonants have changed their sound too  but have remained distinct  an original   p  lenited to  f   and   ɡ  -  consistently attested in pre-islamic  greek transcription of arabic -  became palatalized to  ɡʲ  or  ɟ  by the time of the quran and  d͡ʒ    ɡ    ʒ  or  ɟ  in msa  see arabic phonology local variations for more an original voiceless alveolar lateral fricative   ɬ  became its emphatic counterpart  ɬˠ ɮˤ  was considered by arabs to be the most unusual sound in arabic  hence the classical arabic s appellation لُغَةُ ٱلضَّادِ lughat al-ḍād  or  language of the ḍād    for most modern dialects  it has become an emphatic stop  dˤ  with loss of the or with complete loss of any pharyngealization or velarization   d    the classical ḍād pronunciation of pharyngealization  ɮˤ  still occurs in the mehri language and the similar sound without velarization   ɮ   exists in other modern south arabian languages  other changes may also have happened  classical arabic pronunciation is not thoroughly recorded and different reconstructions of the sound system of proto-semitic  propose different phonetic values  one example is the emphatic consonants  which are pharyngealized in modern pronunciations but may have been velarized in the eighth century and glottalized in of  j  and  w  between vowels occurs in a number of circumstances and is responsible for much of the complexity of third-weak    defective   verbs  early akkadian transcriptions of arabic names shows that this reduction had not yet occurred as of the early part of the 1st  millennium bc the classical arabic language as recorded was a poetic koine that reflected a consciously archaizing dialect  chosen based on the tribes of the western part of the arabian peninsula  who spoke the most conservative variants of arabic  even at the time of muhammed and before  other dialects existed with many more changes  including the loss of most glottal stops  the loss of case endings  the reduction of the diphthongs  aj  and  aw  into monophthongs  eː  oː   etc  most of these changes are present in most or all modern varieties of arabic an interesting feature of the writing system of the quran  and hence of classical arabic  is that it contains certain features of muhammad s native dialect of mecca  corrected through diacritics into the forms of standard classical arabic  among these features visible under the corrections are the loss of the glottal stop and a differing development of the reduction of certain final sequences containing  j   evidently  final /-awa/  became  aː  as in the classical language  but final /-aja/  became a different sound  possibly  eː   rather than again  aː  in the classical language   this is the apparent source of the alif maqṣūrah  restricted alif  where a final /-aja/  is reconstructed  a letter that would normally indicate  j  or some similar high-vowel  sound  but is taken in this context to be a logical variant of alif and represent the sound  aː  the  colloquial  spoken varieties of arabic are learned at home and constitute the native languages of arabic speakers   formal  literary arabic  usually specifically modern standard arabic  is learned at school  although many speakers have a native-like  command of the language  it is technically not the native language of any speakers  both varieties can be both written and spoken  although the colloquial varieties are rarely written down and the formal variety is spoken mostly in formal circumstances  e g   in radio broadcasts  formal lectures  parliamentary discussions and to some extent between speakers of different colloquial varieties  even when the literary language is spoken  however  it is normally only spoken in its pure form when reading a prepared text out loud  when speaking extemporaneously  i e  making up the language on the spot  as in a normal discussion among people   speakers tend to deviate somewhat from the strict literary language in the direction of the colloquial varieties  in fact  there is a continuous range of "in-between"  spoken varieties  from nearly pure modern standard arabic  msa   to a form that still uses msa grammar and vocabulary but with significant colloquial influence  to a form of the colloquial language that imports a number of words and grammatical constructions in msa  to a form that is close to pure colloquial but with the  rough edges   the most noticeably  vulgar  or non-classical  aspects  smoothed out  to pure colloquial  the particular variant  or register  used depends on the social class and education level of the speakers involved and the level of formality of the speech situation  often it will vary within a single encounter  e g   moving from nearly pure msa to a more mixed language in the process of a radio interview  as the interviewee becomes more comfortable with the interviewer  this type of variation is characteristic of the diglossia that exists throughout the arabic-speaking  world although modern standard arabic  msa  is a unitary language  its pronunciation varies somewhat from country to country and from region to region within a country  the variation in individual  accents  of msa speakers tends to mirror corresponding variations in the colloquial speech of the speakers in question  but with the distinguishing characteristics moderated somewhat  note that it is important in descriptions of  arabic  phonology to distinguish between pronunciation of a given colloquial  spoken  dialect and the pronunciation of msa by these same speakers  although they are related  they are not the same  for example  the phoneme that derives from proto-semitic   g  has many different pronunciations in the modern spoken varieties  e g     ʒ   j   ɡʲ   ɡ   speakers whose native variety has either or will use the same pronunciation when speaking msa  even speakers from cairo  whose native egyptian arabic has normally use when speaking msa  the of persian gulf speakers is the only variant pronunciation which isn t found in msa  is used instead another example  many colloquial varieties are known for a type of vowel harmony in which the presence of an  emphatic consonant  triggers backed allophones of nearby vowels  especially of the low vowels  aː   which are backed to in these circumstances and very often fronted to in all other circumstances   in many spoken varieties  the backed or  emphatic  vowel allophones spread a fair distance in both directions from the triggering consonant  in some varieties  most notably egyptian arabic   the  emphatic  allophones spread throughout the entire word  usually including prefixes and suffixes  even at a distance of several syllables from the triggering consonant  speakers of colloquial varieties with this vowel harmony tend to introduce it into their msa pronunciation as well  but usually with a lesser degree of spreading than in the colloquial varieties   for example  speakers of colloquial varieties with extremely long-distance  harmony may allow a moderate  but not extreme  amount of spreading of the harmonic allophones in their msa speech  while speakers of colloquial varieties with moderate-distance  harmony may only harmonize immediately adjacent vowels in msa  modern standard arabic has six pure vowels  with short  a i u  and corresponding long vowels  aː iː uː   there are also two diphthongs   aj  and  aw  the pronunciation of the vowels differs from speaker to speaker  in a way that tends to reflect the pronunciation of the corresponding colloquial variety  nonetheless  there are some common trends  most noticeable is the differing pronunciation of  a  and  aː   which tend towards fronted or in most situations  but a back in the neighborhood of emphatic consonants  some accents and dialects  such as those of the hijaz  have central in all situations  the vowel  a  varies towards too  listen to the final vowel in the recording of al-ʻarabiyyah  at the beginning of this article  for example  the point is  arabic has only three short vowel phonemes  so those phonemes can have a very wide range of allophones  the vowels  u  and  ɪ  are often affected somewhat in emphatic neighborhoods as well  with generally more back or centralized allophones  but the differences are less great than for the low vowels  the pronunciation of short  u  and  i  tends towards and respectively  in many dialects the definition of both  emphatic  and  neighborhood  vary in ways that reflect  to some extent  corresponding variations in the spoken dialects  generally  the consonants triggering  emphatic  allophones are the pharyngealized consonants  tˤ dˤ sˤ ðˤ    q   and  r   if not followed immediately by  i ː    frequently  the velar fricatives  x ɣ  also trigger emphatic allophones  occasionally also the pharyngeal consonants  ʕ ħ   the former more than the latter   many dialects have multiple emphatic allophones of each vowel  depending on the particular nearby consonants  in most msa accents  emphatic coloring of vowels is limited to vowels immediately adjacent to a triggering consonant  although in some it spreads a bit farther  e g   وقت waqt  time   وطن waṭan  homeland   وسط المدينة wasṭ al-madīnah   downtown   sometimes or similar  in a non-emphatic  environment  the vowel  a  in the diphthong  aj  tends to be fronted even more than elsewhere  often pronounced or hence سيف sayf   sæjf   sɛjf   sword  but صيف ṣayf  summer   however  in accents with no emphatic allophones of  a   e g   in the hijaz   the pronunciation occurs in all situations the phoneme  d͡ʒ  is represented by the arabic letter jīm  ج  and has many standard pronunciations  is characteristic of north algeria  iraq  also in most of the arabian peninsula but with an allophonic in some positions  occurs in most of the levant and most north africa  and is used in most of egypt and some regions in yemen and oman  generally this corresponds with the pronunciation in the colloquial in some regions in sudan and yemen  as well as in some sudanese and yemeni dialects  it may be either or representing the original pronunciation of classical arabic  foreign words containing  ɡ  may be transcribed with ج‎  غ‎  ك‎  ق‎  گ‎  ݣ‎ or ڨ‎  mainly depending on the regional spoken variety of arabic or the commonly diacriticized arabic letter  note also that in northern egypt  where the arabic letter jīm  ج  is normally pronounced a separate phoneme  ʒ   which may be transcribed with چ  occurs in a small number of mostly non-arabic  loanwords  e g    ʒakitta   jacket   θ   ث  can be pronounced as or even in some places of maghreb it can be also pronounced as and  ɣ   خ ‎ غ  are velar  post-velar,  or many varieties   ħ  ʕ   ح ‎ ع  are actually epiglottal ʢ   despite what is reported in many earlier works   l  is pronounced as velarized in الله  ʔallaːh   the name of god  q e  allah  when the word follows a  ā  u or ū  after i or ī it is unvelarized  بسم الله bismi l–lāh  bismillaːh    some speakers velarize other occurrences of  l  in msa  in imitation of their spoken dialects the emphatic consonant  dˤ  was actually pronounced or possibly way  a highly unusual sound  the medieval arabs actually termed their language lughat al-ḍād   the language of the ḍād   the name of the letter used for this sound   since they thought the sound was unique to their language   in fact  it also exists in a few other minority semitic languages  e g   mehri  arabic has consonants traditionally termed  emphatic   tˤ  dˤ  sˤ  ðˤ   ط ‎ ض ‎ ص ‎ ظ   which exhibit simultaneous pharyngealization dˤ  sˤ  ðˤ  as well as varying degrees of velarization dˠ  sˠ  ðˠ   so they may be written with the  velarized or pharyngealized  diacritic   ̴   as   t̴  d̴  s̴  ð̴   this simultaneous articulation is described as  retracted tongue root  by in some transcription systems  emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter  for example   dˤ  is written ⟨d⟩  in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it  for example  ⟨ḍ⟩ vowels and consonants can be phonologically short or long  long  geminate  consonants are normally written doubled in latin transcription  i e  bb  dd  etc    reflecting the presence of the arabic diacritic mark shaddah  which indicates doubled consonants  in actual pronunciation  doubled consonants are held twice as long as short consonants  this consonant lengthening is phonemically contrastive  قبل qabila  he accepted  vs  قبّل qabbala  he kissed  arabic has two kinds of syllables  open syllables  cv  and  cvv —and closed syllables  cvc    cvvc  and  cvcc   the syllable types with two morae  units of time   i e  cvc and cvv  are termed heavy syllables  while those with three morae  i e  cvvc and cvcc  are superheavy syllables  superheavy syllables in classical arabic occur in only two places  at the end of the sentence  due to pausal pronunciation  and in words such as حارّ ḥārr  hot   مادّة māddah  stuff  substance   تحاجوا taḥājjū  they disputed with each other   where a long ā occurs before two identical consonants  a former short vowel between the consonants has been lost    in less formal pronunciations of modern standard arabic  superheavy syllables are common at the end of words or before clitic suffixes such as -nā   us  our   due to the deletion of final short vowels  in surface pronunciation  every vowel must be preceded by a consonant  which may include the glottal stop there are no cases of hiatus within a word  where two vowels occur next to each other  without an intervening consonant   some words do have an underlying vowel at the beginning  such as the definite article al-  or words such as اشترا ishtarā  he bought   اجتماع ijtimāʻ  meeting   when actually pronounced  one of three things happens word stress is not phonemically contrastive in standard arabic  it bears a strong relationship to vowel length  the basic rules for modern standard arabic are examples kitāb un   book   kā-ti-b(un)   writer   mak-ta-b(un)   desk   ma-kā-ti-b(u)   desks   mak-ta-ba-tun   library   but mak-ta-ba(-tun)   library  in short pronunciation   ka-ta-bū   modern standard arabic   they wrote    ka-ta-bu   dialect   ka-ta-bū-h(u)   modern standard arabic   they wrote it    ka-ta-bū   dialect   ka-ta-ba-tā   modern standard arabic   they  dual  fem  wrote   ka-tab-tu   modern standard arabic   i wrote    ka-tabt   short form or dialect   doubled consonants count as two consonants  ma-jal-la-(tan)   magazine   ma-ḥall(-un)   place  these rules may result in differently stressed syllables when final case endings are pronounced  vs  the normal situation where they are not pronounced  as in the above example of mak-ta-ba-tun   library  in full pronunciation  but mak-ta-ba(-tun)   library  in short pronunciation the restriction on final long vowels does not apply to the spoken dialects  where original final long vowels have been shortened and secondary final long vowels have arisen from loss of original final -hu/hi.some  dialects have different stress rules  in the cairo  egyptian arabic  dialect a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word  hence mad-ra-sah   school   qā-hi-rah   cairo   this also affects the way that modern standard arabic is pronounced in egypt  in the arabic of sanaa  stress is often retracted  bay-tayn   two houses   mā-sat-hum   their table   ma-kā-tīb   desks   zā-rat-ḥīn   sometimes   mad-ra-sat-hum   their school    in this dialect  only syllables with long vowels or diphthongs are considered heavy  in a two-syllable  word  the final syllable can be stressed only if the preceding syllable is light  and in longer words  the final syllable cannot be stressed  the final short vowels  e g   the case endings -a  -i  -u  and mood endings -u  -a)  are often not pronounced in this language  despite forming part of the formal paradigm of nouns and verbs  the following levels of pronunciation exist this is the most formal level actually used in speech  all endings are pronounced as written  except at the end of an utterance  where the following changes occur this is a formal level of pronunciation sometimes seen  it is somewhat like pronouncing all words as if they were in pausal position  with influence from the colloquial varieties   the following changes occur this is the pronunciation used by speakers of modern standard arabic in extemporaneous speech  i e  when producing new sentences rather than simply reading a prepared text  it is similar to formal short pronunciation except that the rules for dropping final vowels apply even when a clitic suffix is added  basically  short-vowel  case and mood endings are never pronounced and certain other changes occur that echo the corresponding colloquial pronunciations  specifically as mentioned above  many spoken dialects have a process of emphasis spreading  where the  emphasis   pharyngealization  of emphatic consonants spreads forward and back through adjacent syllables  pharyngealizing all nearby consonants and triggering the back allophone in all nearby low vowels  the extent of emphasis spreading varies  for example  in moroccan arabic  it spreads as far as the first full vowel  i e  sound derived from a long vowel or diphthong  on either side  in many levantine dialects  it spreads indefinitely  but is blocked by any  j  or  ʃ   while in egyptian arabic  it usually spreads throughout the entire word  including prefixes and suffixes  in moroccan arabic   i u  also have emphatic allophones and respectively unstressed short vowels  especially  i u   are deleted in many contexts  many sporadic examples of short vowel change have occurred  especially  a → i  and interchange  i ↔ u    most levantine dialects merge short  i u  into  ǝ  in most contexts  all except directly before a single final consonant   in moroccan arabic  on the other hand  short  u  triggers labialization of nearby consonants  especially velar consonants and uvular consonants   and then short  a i u  all merge into  ǝ   which is deleted in many contexts   the labialization plus  ǝ  is sometimes interpreted as an underlying phoneme  ŭ    this essentially causes the wholesale loss of the short-long  vowel distinction  with the original long vowels  aː iː uː  remaining as half-long  iˑ uˑ   phonemically  a i u   which are used to represent both short and long vowels in borrowings from literary arabic most spoken dialects have monophthongized original  aj aw  to  eː oː   in all circumstances  including adjacent to emphatic consonants   in moroccan arabic  these have subsequently merged into original  iː uː  in some dialects  there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above  for example  non-arabic  is used in the maghrebi dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names  semitic became extremely early on in arabic before it was written down  a few modern arabic dialects  such as iraqi  influenced by persian and kurdish  distinguish between and the iraqi arabic also uses sounds and uses persian adding letters  e g   گوجة gawjah – a plum  چمة chimah – a truffle and so on early in the expansion of arabic  the separate emphatic phonemes and coalesced into a single phoneme many dialects  such as egyptian  levantine  and much of the maghreb  subsequently lost interdental fricatives  converting ð ðˤ  into d dˤ   most dialects borrow  learned  words from the standard language using the same pronunciation as for inherited words  but some dialects without interdental fricatives  particularly in egypt and the levant  render original ð ðˤ dˤ  in borrowed words as z zˤ dˤ  another key distinguishing mark of arabic dialects is how they render the original velar and uvular plosives  q    d͡ʒ  (proto-semitic   ɡ    and  k  pharyngealization of the emphatic consonants tends to weaken in many of the spoken varieties  and to spread from emphatic consonants to nearby sounds  in addition  the  emphatic  allophone automatically triggers pharyngealization of adjacent sounds in many dialects  as a result  it may difficult or impossible to determine whether a given coronal consonant is phonemically emphatic or not  especially in dialects with long-distance  emphasis spreading   a notable exception is the sounds  t  vs   tˤ  in moroccan arabic  because the former is pronounced as an affricate but the latter is not  as in other semitic languages  arabic has a complex and unusual morphology  i e  method of constructing words from a basic root   arabic has a nonconcatenative "root-and-pattern"  morphology  a root consists of a set of bare consonants  usually three   which are fitted into a discontinuous pattern to form words  for example  the word for  i wrote  is constructed by combining the root k-t-b   write  with the pattern -a-a-tu   i xed  to form katabtu  i wrote   other verbs meaning  i xed  will typically have the same pattern but with different consonants  e g  qaraʼtu  i read   akaltu  i ate   dhahabtu  i went   although other patterns are possible  e g  sharibtu  i drank   qultu  i said   takallamtu  i spoke   where the subpattern used to signal the past tense may change but the suffix -tu  is always used  from a single root k-t-b,  numerous words can be formed by applying different patterns nouns in literary arabic have three grammatical cases  nominative  accusative  and genitive used when the noun is governed by a preposition    three numbers  singular  dual and plural   two genders  masculine and feminine   and three  states   indefinite  definite  and construct   the cases of singular nouns  other than those that end in long ā  are indicated by suffixed short vowels (/-u/  for nominative  /-a/  for accusative  /-i/  for genitive  the feminine singular is often marked by /-at/,  which is reduced to /-ah/  or /-a/  before a pause  plural is indicated either through endings  the sound plural  or internal modification  the broken plural   definite nouns include all proper nouns  all nouns in  construct state  and all nouns which are prefixed by the definite article /al-/.  indefinite singular nouns  other than those that end in long ā  add a final /-n/  to the case-marking  vowels  giving /-un/,  /-an/  or /-in/   which is also referred to as nunation or tanwīn  adjectives in literary arabic are marked for case  number  gender and state  as for nouns  however  the plural of all non-human  nouns is always combined with a singular feminine adjective  which takes the /-ah/  or /-at/  suffix pronouns in literary arabic are marked for person  number and gender  there are two varieties  independent pronouns and enclitics  enclitic pronouns are attached to the end of a verb  noun or preposition and indicate verbal and prepositional objects or possession of nouns  the first-person  singular pronoun has a different enclitic form used for verbs (/-ni/)  and for nouns or prepositions (/-ī/  after consonants  /-ya/  after vowels  nouns  verbs  pronouns and adjectives agree with each other in all respects  however  non-human  plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular  furthermore  a verb in a verb-initial  sentence is marked as singular regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun  numerals between three and ten show  chiasmic  agreement  in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versa verbs in literary arabic are marked for person  first  second  or third   gender  and number  they are conjugated in two major paradigms  past and non-past);  two voices  active and passive   and six moods  indicative  imperative  subjunctive  jussive  shorter energetic and longer energetic   the fifth and sixth moods  the energetics  exist only in classical arabic but not in there are also two participles  active and passive  and a verbal noun  but no infinitive the past and non-past  paradigms are sometimes also termed perfective and imperfective  indicating the fact that they actually represent a combination of tense and aspect  the moods other than the indicative occur only in the non-past,  and the future tense is signaled by prefixing sa-  or sawfa onto the non-past.  the past and non-past  differ in the form of the stem  e g   past katab-  vs  non-past  -ktub-),  and also use completely different sets of affixes for indicating person  number and gender  in the past  the person  number and gender are fused into a single suffixal morpheme  while in the non-past,  a combination of prefixes  primarily encoding person  and suffixes  primarily encoding gender and number  are used  the passive voice uses the same person number gender affixes but changes the vowels of the stem the following shows a paradigm of a regular arabic verb  kataba  to write   note that in modern standard  the energetic mood  in either long or short form  which have the same meaning  is almost never used like other semitic languages  and unlike most other languages  arabic makes much more use of nonconcatenative morphology  applying a large number of templates applied roots  to derive words than adding prefixes or suffixes to words for verbs  a given root can occur in many different derived verb stems  of which there are about fifteen   each with one or more characteristic meanings and each with its own templates for the past and non-past  stems  active and passive participles  and verbal noun  these are referred to by western scholars as  form i    form ii   and so on through  form xv   although forms xi to xv are rare   these stems encode grammatical functions such as the causative  intensive and reflexive  stems sharing the same root consonants represent separate verbs  albeit often semantically related  and each is the basis for its own conjugational paradigm  as a result  these derived stems are part of the system of derivational morphology  not part of the inflectional system examples of the different verbs formed from the root k-t-b   write   using ḥ-m-r   red  for form ix  which is limited to colors and physical defects  form ii is sometimes used to create transitive denominative verbs  verbs built from nouns   form v is the equivalent used for intransitive denominatives the associated participles and verbal nouns of a verb are the primary means of forming new lexical nouns in arabic  this is similar to the process by which  for example  the english gerund  meeting   similar to a verbal noun  has turned into a noun referring to a particular type of social  often work-related  event where people gather together to have a  discussion   another lexicalized verbal noun   another fairly common means of forming nouns is through one of a limited number of patterns that can be applied directly to roots  such as the  nouns of location  in ma-   e g  maktab  desk  office    k-t-b   write   maṭbakh  kitchen    ṭ-b-kh   cook   the only three genuine suffixes are as follows the spoken dialects have lost the case distinctions and make only limited use of the dual  it occurs only on nouns and its use is no longer required in all circumstances   they have lost the mood distinctions other than imperative  but many have since gained new moods through the use of prefixes  most often /bi-/  for indicative vs  unmarked subjunctive   they have also mostly lost the indefinite  nunation  and the internal passive the following is an example of a regular verb paradigm in egyptian arabic the arabic alphabet derives from the aramaic through nabatean  to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of coptic or cyrillic scripts to greek script  traditionally  there were several differences between the western  north african  and middle eastern versions of the alphabet—in particular  the faʼ had a dot underneath and qaf a single dot above in the maghreb  and the order of the letters was slightly different  at least when they were used as numerals  however  the old maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the maghreb itself  and remains in use mainly in the quranic schools  zaouias  of west africa  arabic  like all other semitic languages  except for the latin-written  maltese  and the languages with the ge ez script   is written from right to left  there are several styles of script  notably naskh  which is used in print and by computers  and ruqʻah  which is commonly used in khalil ibn ahmad al farahidi finally fixed the arabic script around 786,  many styles were developed  both for the writing down of the quran and other books  and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as calligraphy has in the western world  and is still considered by arabs as a major art form  calligraphers are held in great esteem  being cursive by nature  unlike the latin script  arabic script is used to write down a verse of the quran  a hadith  or simply a proverb  the composition is often abstract  but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal  one of the current masters of the genre is hassan massoudy in modern times the intrinsically calligraphic nature of the written arabic form is haunted by the thought that a typographic approach to the language  necessary for digitized unification  will not always accurately maintain meanings conveyed through are a number of different standards for the romanization of arabic  i e  methods of accurately and efficiently representing arabic with the latin script  there are various conflicting motivations involved  which leads to multiple systems  some are interested in transliteration  i e  representing the spelling of arabic  while others focus on transcription  i e  representing the pronunciation of arabic   they differ in that  for example  the same letter ي is used to represent both a consonant  as in  you  or  yet   and a vowel  as in  me  or  eat    some systems  e g  for scholarly use  are intended to accurately and unambiguously represent the phonemes of arabic  generally making the phonetics more explicit than the original word in the arabic script  these systems are heavily reliant on diacritical marks such as  š  for the sound equivalently written sh in english  other systems  e g  the bahá í orthography  are intended to help readers who are neither arabic speakers nor linguists with intuitive pronunciation of arabic names and these less  scientific  tend to avoid diacritics and use digraphs  like sh and kh   these are usually simpler to read  but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems  and may lead to ambiguities  e g  whether to interpret sh as a single sound  as in gash  or a combination of two sounds  as in gashouse  the ala-lc  romanization solves this problem by separating the two sounds with a prime symbol   ′    e g   as′hal  easier  during the last few decades and especially since the 1990s,  western-invented  text communication technologies have become prevalent in the arab world  such as personal computers  the world wide web  email  bulletin board systems  irc  instant messaging and mobile phone text messaging  most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the latin script only  and some of them still do not have the arabic script as an optional feature  as a result  arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the arabic text using the latin script  sometimes known as im arabic to handle those arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the latin script  numerals and other characters were appropriated  for example  the numeral "3"  may be used to represent the arabic letter ⟨ع⟩  there is no universal name for this type of transliteration  but some have named it arabic chat alphabet  other systems of transliteration exist  such as using dots or capitalization to represent the  emphatic  counterparts of certain consonants  for instance  using capitalization  the letter ⟨د⟩  may be represented by d  its emphatic counterpart  ⟨ض⟩  may be written as d in most of present-day  north africa  the western arabic numerals (0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9)  are used  however  in egypt and arabic-speaking  countries to the east of it  the eastern arabic numerals (٠‎  – ١‎  – ٢‎  – ٣‎  – ٤‎  – ٥‎  – ٦‎  – ٧‎  – ٨‎  – ٩‎)  are in use  when representing a number in arabic  the lowest-valued  position is placed on the right  so the order of positions is the same as in left-to-right  scripts  sequences of digits such as telephone numbers are read from left to right  but numbers are spoken in the traditional arabic fashion  with units and tens reversed from the modern english usage  for example  24  is said  four and twenty  just like in the german language  vierundzwanzig  and classical hebrew  and 1975  is said  a thousand and nine-hundred  and five and seventy  or  more eloquently   a thousand and nine-hundred  five seventy academy of the arabic language is the name of a number of language-regulation  bodies formed in the arab league  the most active are in damascus and cairo  they review language development  monitor new words and approve inclusion of new words into their published standard dictionaries  they also publish old and historical arabic manuscripts arabic has been taught worldwide in many elementary and secondary schools  especially muslim schools  universities around the world have classes that teach arabic as part of their foreign languages  middle eastern studies  and religious studies courses  arabic language schools exist to assist students to learn arabic outside the academic world  there are many arabic language schools in the arab world and other muslim countries  because the quran is written in arabic and all islamic terms are in arabic  needed  of muslims  both arab and non-arab)  study the language  software and books with tapes are also important part of arabic learning  as many of arabic learners may live in places where there are no academic or arabic language school classes available  radio series of arabic language classes are also provided from some radio needed  a number of websites on the internet provide online classes for all levels as a means of distance education  most teach modern standard arabic  but some teach regional varieties from numerous arab linguists considered the arabic language to be superior to all other languages  and took almost no interest in learning any language other than needed   with the sole example of medieval linguist abu hayyan al-gharnati  -  who  while a scholar of the arabic language  was not ethnically arab -  scholars of the arabic language made no efforts at studying comparative linguistics  considering all other languages modern times  the educated upper classes in the arab world have taken a nearly opposite view  yasir suleiman wrote in 2011  that  studying and knowing english or french in most of the middle east and north africa have become a badge of sophistication and modernity and     feigning  or asserting  weakness or lack of facility in arabic is sometimes paraded as a sign of status  class  and perversely  even education through a mélange of code-switching  arab-american  professor franck salamah went as far as to declare arabic a dead language conveying dead ideas  blaming its stagnation for arab intellectual stagnation and lamenting that great writers in arabic are judged by their command of the language and not the merit of the ideas they express with
