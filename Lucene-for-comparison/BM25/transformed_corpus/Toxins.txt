 toxin -  wikipediaa toxin  from ancient greek  τοξικόν toxikon  is a poisonous substance produced within living cells or synthetic toxicants created by artificial processes are thus excluded  the term was first used by organic chemist ludwig brieger can be small molecules  peptides  or proteins that are capable of causing disease on contact with or absorption by body tissues interacting with biological macromolecules such as enzymes or cellular receptors  toxins vary greatly in their toxicity  ranging from usually minor  such as a bee sting  to almost immediately deadly  such as botulinum toxin  toxins are often distinguished from other chemical agents by their method of production—the word toxin does not specify method of delivery  compare with venom and the broader meaning of poison—all substances that can also cause disturbances to organisms   it simply means it is a biologically produced poison  there was an ongoing terminological dispute between nato and the warsaw pact over whether to call a toxin a biological or chemical agent  in which the nato opted for biological agent  and the warsaw pact  like most other countries in the world  for chemical needed according to an international committee of the red cross review of the biological weapons convention   toxins are poisonous products of organisms  unlike biological agents  they are inanimate and not capable of reproducing themselves   and  since the signing of the constitition  there have been no disputes among the parties regarding the definition of biological agents or to title 18  of the united states code       the term  toxin  means the toxic material or product of plants  animals  microorganisms  including  but not limited to  bacteria  viruses  fungi  rickettsiae or protozoa   or infectious substances  or a recombinant or synthesized molecule  whatever their origin and method of rather informal terminology of individual toxins relates them to the anatomical location where their effects are most notable on a broader scale  toxins may be classified as either exotoxins  being excreted by an organism  or endotoxins  that are released mainly when bacteria are lysed the term  biotoxin  is sometimes used to explicitly confirm the biological biotoxins are further classified into fungal biotoxins  or short mycotoxins  microbial biotoxins  plant biotoxins  short phytotoxins and animal biotoxins toxins produced by microorganisms are important virulence determinants responsible for microbial pathogenicity and or evasion of the host immune vary greatly in purpose and mechanism  and can be highly complex  the venom of the cone snail contains dozens of small proteins  each targeting a specific nerve channel or receptor   or relatively small protein biotoxins in nature have two primary functions some of the more well known types of biotoxins include the term  environmental toxin  can sometimes explicitly include synthetic such as industrial pollutants and other artificially made toxic substances  as this contradicts most formal definitions of the term  toxin   it is important to confirm what the researcher means when encountering the term outside of microbiological contexts environmental toxins from food chains that may be dangerous to human health include the toxicology and environmental health information program at the united states national library of medicine  nlm  maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to toxins-related  resources produced by tehip and by other government agencies and organizations  this web site includes links to databases  bibliographies  tutorials  and other scientific and consumer-oriented  resources  tehip also is responsible for the toxicology data network an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web toxmap is a geographic information system  gis  that is part of toxnet  toxmap uses maps of the united states to help users visually explore data from the united states environmental protection agency s  epa  toxics release inventory and superfund basic research programs one of the bottlenecks in peptide/protein-based  therapy is their toxicity  recently  in silico models for predicting toxicity of peptides and proteins  developed by gajendra pal singh raghava s predict toxicity with reasonably good accuracy  the prediction models are based on machine learning technique and quantitative matrix using various properties of peptides  the prediction tool is freely accessible to public in the form of web used non-technically,  the term  toxin  is often applied to any toxic substance  even though the term toxicant would be more appropriate  toxic substances not directly of biological origin are also termed poisons and many non-technical  and lifestyle journalists follow this usage to refer to toxic substances in needed in the context of quackery and alternative medicine  the term  toxin  is used to refer to any substance alleged to cause ill health  this could range from trace amounts of potentially dangerous pesticides  to supposedly harmful substances produced in the body by intestinal fermentation (auto-intoxication),  to food ingredients such as table sugar  monosodium glutamate  msg   and
