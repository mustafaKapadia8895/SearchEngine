 snowboarding -  wikipediasnowboarding is a recreational activity and olympic and paralympic sport that involves descending a snow-covered  slope while standing on a snowboard attached to a rider s feet the development of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding  sledding  surfing and skiing  it was developed in the united states in the 1960s,  became a winter olympic sport at nagano in and first featured in the winter paralympics at sochi in its popularity  as measured by equipment sales  in the united states peaked in 2007  and has been in a decline snowboarding began in 1965  when sherman poppen  an engineer in muskegon  michigan  invented a toy for his daughters by fastening two skis together and attaching a rope to one end so he would have some control as they stood on the board and glided downhill  dubbed the  snurfer   combining snow and surfer  by his wife nancy  the toy proved so popular among his daughters  friends that poppen licensed the idea to a manufacturer  brunswick corporation  that sold about a million snurfers over the next decade  and  in 1966  alone over half a million snurfers were february of 1968,  poppen organized the first snurfing competition at a michigan ski resort that attracted enthusiasts from all over the country  one of those early pioneers was tom sims  a devotee of skateboarding  a sport born in the 1950s  when kids attached roller skate wheels to small boards that they steered by shifting their weight   as an eighth grader in haddonfield  new jersey  in the 1960s,  sims crafted a snowboard in his school shop class by gluing carpet to the top of a piece of wood and attaching aluminum sheeting to the bottom  he produced commercial snowboards in the needed  articles about his invention in such mainstream magazines as newsweek helped publicize the young needed the pioneers were not all from the united states  in 1976,  welsh skateboard enthusiasts jon roberts and pete matthews developed their own snowboards to use at their local dry ski needed also during this same period  in 1977,  jake burton carpenter  a vermont native who had enjoyed snurfing since the age of 14,  impressed the crowd at a michigan snurfing competition with bindings he had designed to secure his feet to the board  that same year  he founded burton snowboards in londonderry  vermont  the  snowboards  were made of wooden planks that were flexible and had water ski foot traps  very few people picked up snowboarding because the price of the board was considered too high at $38,  but eventually burton would become the biggest snowboarding company in the first competitions to offer prize money were the national snurfing championship  held at muskegon state park in muskegon in 1979,  jake burton carpenter  came from vermont to compete with a snowboard of his own design  there were protests about jake entering with a non-snurfer  board  paul graves  and others  advocated that jake be allowed to race  a  modified   open  division was created and won by jake as the sole entrant  that race was considered the first competition for snowboards and is the start of what has now become competitive snowboarding  ken kampenga  john asmussen and jim trim placed 1st,  2nd  and 3rd  respectively in the standard competition with best 2  combined times of 24.71,  25.02  and 25.41  and jake carpenter won prize money as the sole entrant in the  open  division with a time of in 1980  the event moved to pando winter sports park near grand rapids  michigan because of a lack of snow that year at the original snowboarding became more popular in the 1970s  and 1980s,  pioneers such as dimitrije milovich  jake burton carpenter  founder of burton snowboards from londonderry  vermont   tom sims  founder of sims snowboards   and mike olson  founder of gnu snowboards  came up with new designs for boards and mechanisms that slowly developed into the snowboards and other related equipment that we know 1982,  the first usa national snowboard race was held near woodstock  vermont  at suicide six  the race  organized by graves  was won by burton s first team rider doug 1983,  the first world championship halfpipe competition was held at soda springs  california  tom sims  founder of sims snowboards  organized the event with the help of mike chantry  a snowboard instructor at soda 1985,  the first world cup was held in zürs  austria  further cementing snowboarding s recognition as an official international competitive sport in 1990,  the international snowboard federation  isf  was founded to provide universal contest regulations  in addition  the united states of america snowboard association  usasa  provides instructing guidelines and runs snowboard competitions in the u s  today  high-profile  snowboarding events like the winter x games  air   style  us open  olympic games and other events are broadcast worldwide  many alpine resorts have terrain parks at the 1998  winter olympic games in nagano  japan  snowboarding became an official olympic event  france s karine ruby was the first ever to win an olympic gold medal for woman s snowboarding at the 1998  olympics  while canadian ross was the first ever to win an olympic gold medal for men s snowboarding initially  ski areas adopted the sport at a much slower pace than the winter sports public  indeed  for many years  there was animosity between skiers and snowboarders  which led to an ongoing skier vs snowboarder early snowboards were banned from the slopes by park officials  for several years snowboarders would have to take a small skills assessment prior to being allowed to ride the chairlifts  it was thought that an unskilled snowboarder would wipe the snow off the mountain  in 1985,  only seven percent of u s  ski areas allowed with a similar proportion in europe  as equipment and skills improved  gradually snowboarding became more accepted  in 1990,  most major ski areas had separate slopes for snowboarders  now  approximately 97%  of all ski areas in north america and europe allow snowboarding  and more than half have jumps  rails and half pipes an excellent year for snowboarding was 2004,  with 6.6  million an industry spokesman said that  twelve year-olds  are out-riding  adults   the same article said that most snowboarders are 18–24  years old and that females constitute 25%  of participants there were 8.2  million snowboarders in the usa and canada for the 2009-2010  season  there was a 10%  increase over the previous season  accounting for more than 30%  of all snow sports 2  may 2012,  the international paralympic committee announced that adaptive snowboarding  dubbed "para-snowboarding")  would debut as a men s and women s medal event in the 2014  paralympic winter games taking place in sochi  snowboarding s inception as an established winter sport  it has developed various styles  each with its own specialized equipment and technique  the most common styles today are  freeride  freestyle  and freecarve race  these styles are used for both recreational and professional snowboarding  while each style is unique  there is overlap between them  see also list of snowboard tricks  jibbing  is technical riding on non-standard  surfaces  which usually includes performing tricks  the word  jib  is both a noun and a verb  depending on the usage of the word  as a noun  a jib includes metal rails  boxes  benches  concrete ledges  walls  vehicles  rocks and logs  as a verb  to jib is referring to the action of jumping  sliding or riding on top of objects other than it is directly influenced by grinding a skateboard  jibbing is a freestyle snowboarding technique of riding  typically jibbing occurs in a snowboard resort park but can also be done in urban environments freeriding communicates the concept of dynamically altering various snowboarding styles in a fluid motion  allowing for a spontaneous ride on naturally rugged terrain  see also backcountry snowboarding freestyle snowboarding is any riding that includes performing tricks  in freestyle  the rider utilizes natural and man-made  features such as rails  jumps  boxes  and innumerable others to perform tricks  it is a popular all-inclusive  concept that distinguishes the creative aspects of snowboarding  in contrast to a style like alpine snowboarding alpine snowboarding is a discipline within the sport of it is practised on groomed pistes  it has been an olympic event since 1998.sometimes  called freecarving  this takes place on hard packed snow or groomed runs and focuses on carving linked turns  much like surfing or longboarding  little or no jumping takes place in this discipline  alpine snowboarding consists of a small portion of the general snowboard population  that has a well connected social community and its own specific board manufacturers  alpine snowboard equipment is a ski-like  hardshell boot and plate binding system with a true directional snowboard that is stiffer and narrower to manage linking turns with greater forces and speed  shaped skis can thank these  freecarve  snowboards for the cutting-edge  technology leading to their a skilled alpine snowboarder can link numerous turns into a run placing their body very close to the ground each turn  similar to a motogp turn or waterski carve  depending on factors including stiffness  turning radius and personality this can be done slowly or fast  carvers make perfect half-circles  out of each turn  changing edges when the snowboard is perpendicular to the fall line and starting every turn on the downhill edge  carving on a snowboard is like riding a roller coaster  because the board will lock into a turn radius and provide what feels like multiple gs of snowboarding shares more visual similarities with skiing equipment than it does with snowboarding compared to freestyle snowboarding perform tricks while descending a course  moving around  over  across  up  or down terrain features  the course is full of obstacles including boxes  rails  jumps  jibs  includes anything the board or rider can slide across   slope-style  contests consists of choosing your own line in a terrain park using a variety of boxes  jibs and jumps  to win a slope-style  contest one must pick the best and most difficult line in the terrain park and have a smooth flowing line of tricks performed on the obstacles  overall impression is also a huge factor in winning a slope-style  contest  the rider who lands the hardest tricks will not always win over the rider who lands easier tricks big air competitions are contests where riders perform tricks after launching off a man made jump built specifically for the competitors perform tricks in the air  aiming to attain sizable height and distance  all while securing a clean landing  many competitions also require the rider to do a complex trick  but not all competitions call for a trick to win the gold  some intermittent competitions are based solely on height and distance of the launch of the snowboarder  some competitions also require the rider to do a specific trick to win the major one of the first snowboard competitions where travis rice attempted and landed a  double back flip backside 180"  took place at the 2006  red bull gap half-pipe  is a semi-circular  ditch dug into the mountain or purpose built ramp made up of snow  with walls between 8  and 23  feet (7.0  m   competitors perform tricks while going from one side to the other and while in the air above the sides of the pipe boardercross  also known as  boarder x  and  snowboard x   is a very popular but relatively recent winter sport  starting in the 1980s  and earning its place as an official winter olympic sport in the 2006  turin games  in boardercross  several riders  usually 4  to 6)  race down a course similar to a motorcycle motocross track  with jumps  berms and other obstacles constructed out of snow on a downhill course   unlike traditional head-to-head  races  competitors use the same terrain  sometimes resulting in accidental collisions in snowboarding racing  riders must complete a downhill course constructed of a series of turning indicators  gates  placed in the snow at prescribed distances apart  a gate consists of a tall pole  and a short pole  connected by a triangular panel  the racer must pass around the short side of the gate  there are 3  main formats used in snowboard racing including  single person  parallel courses or multiple people on the course at the same time  sbx  some of the larger snowboarding contests include  the air   style  the x-trail  jam  burton global open series  shakedown  fis world championships  fis world cup  the winter x games and the winter dew tour snowboarder magazine s event was created in 1996.  over 150  of the world s top pros are invited to advance freestyle snowboarding on the most progressive terrain of the snowboarding approach is to ensure maximum fun  friendship and event quality  reflecting this perspective of snowboarding  you can find  anti contests  are an important part of its identity including the holy oly at the summit at snoqualmie  the nate chute hawaiian classic at whitefish  the original anti-contst,  the world quarterpipe championships and the grenade games the united states of america snowboarding association  usasa  features three different divisions which include alpine  freestyle  and boardercross  alpine consists of giant slalom and slalom which is a competition in which the agility and ability to make sharp turns of the snowboarders are tested  freestyle consists of slopestyle and halfpipe  in boardercross  the idea is to be the first snowboarder down the mountain where everyone is racing each other through an obstacle course of harsh turns and wipeout potential is very the usasa has 36  regional snowboard series in which anyone can snowboarding way of life came about as a natural response to the culture from which it emerged  early on  there was a rebellion against skiing culture and the view that snowboarders were inferior  skiers did not easily accept this new culture on their slopes  the two cultures contrasted each other in several ways including how they spoke  acted  and their entire style of clothing  snowboarders first embraced the punk and later the hip-hop  look into their style  words such as  dude    gnarly   and  shred the gnar  are some examples of words used in the snowboarding culture  snowboarding subculture became a crossover between the urban and suburban styles on snow  which made an easy transition from surfing and skateboarding culture over to snowboarding early stereotypes of snowboarding included  lazy    grungy    punk    stoners    troublemakers   and numerous others  many of which are associated with skateboarding and surfing as well  however  these stereotypes may be considered  out of style   snowboarding has become a sport that encompasses a very diverse international based crowd and fanbase of many millions  so much so that it is no longer possible to stereotype such a large community  reasons for these dying stereotypes include how mainstream and popular the sport has become  with the shock factor of snowboarding s quick take off on the slopes wearing off  skiers and snowboarders are becoming used to each other  showing more respect to each other on the mountain   the typical stereotype of the sport is changing as the demographics some other winter sports  snowboarding comes with a certain level of injury rate for snowboarding is about four to six per thousand persons per day  which is around double the injury rate for alpine injuries are more likely amongst beginners  especially those who do not take lessons with professional instructors  a quarter of all injuries occur to first-time  riders and half of all injuries occur to those with less than a year of experience  experienced riders are less likely to suffer injury  but the injuries that do occur tend to be more thirds of injuries occur to the upper body and one third to the lower body  this contrasts with alpine skiing where two thirds of injuries are to the lower body  the most common types of injuries are sprains  which account for around 40%  of the most common point of injury is the wrists – 40%  of all snowboard injuries are to the wrists and 24%  of all snowboard injuries are wrist there are around 100,000  wrist fractures worldwide among snowboarders each for this reason the use of wrist guards  either separate or built into gloves  is very strongly recommended  they are often compulsory in beginner s classes and their use reduces the likelihood of wrist injury by in addition it is important for snow boarders to learn how to fall without stopping the fall with their hand by trying to  push  the slope away  as landing a wrist which is bent at a 90  degree angle increase the chance of it breaking  rather  landing with the arms stretched out  like a wing  and slapping the slope with the entire arm is an effective way to break a fall  this is the method used by practitioners of judo and other martial arts to break a fall when they are thrown against the floor by a training partner the risk of head injury is two to six times greater for snowboarders than for skiers and injuries follow the pattern of being rarer  but more severe  with experienced riders  head injuries can occur both as a consequence of a collision and when failing to carry out a heel-side  turn  the latter can result in the rider landing on his or her back and slamming the back of his or her head onto the ground  resulting in an occipital head for this reason  helmets are widely recommended  protective eyewear is also recommended as eye injury can be caused by impact and snow blindness can be a result of exposure to strong ultra-violet  light in snow-covered  areas  the wearing of ultra-violet-absorbing  goggles is recommended even on hazy or cloudy days as ultra-violet  light can penetrate ski bindings  snowboard bindings are not designed to release automatically in a fall  the mechanical support provided by the feet being locked to the board has the effect of reducing the likelihood of knee injury – 15%  of snowboard injuries are to the knee  compared with 45%  of all skiing injuries  such injuries are typically to the knee ligaments  bone fractures are fractures to the lower leg are also rare but 20%  of injuries are to the foot and ankle  fractures of the talus bone are rare in other sports but account for 2%  of snowboard injuries – a lateral process talus fracture is sometimes called  snowboarder s ankle  by medical staff  this particular injury results in persistent lateral pain in the affected ankle yet is difficult to spot in a plain x-ray  image  it may be misdiagnosed as just a sprain  with possibly serious consequences as not treating the fracture can result in serious long-term  damage to the the use of portable ultrasound for mountainside diagnostics has been reviewed and appears to be a plausible tool for diagnosing some of the common injuries associated with the to eight percent of snowboarding injuries take place while the person is waiting in ski-lift  lines or entering and exiting ski lifts  snowboarders push themselves forward with a free foot while in the ski-lift  line  leaving the other foot  usually that of the lead leg  locked on the board at a 9–27  degree angle  placing a large torque force on this leg and predisposing the person to knee injury if a fall snowboard binding rotating devices are designed to minimize the torque force  quick being the first developed in they allow snowboarders to turn the locked foot straight into the direction of the tip of the snowboard without removing the boot from the boot binding avalanches are a clear danger when on snowy mountain it is best to learn the different kinds of avalanches  how to prevent causing one and how to react when one is going to happen  also when going out onto the snow  all who practice an activity with increased chances of injury should have a basic first aid knowledge and know how to deal with injuries that may boots should be well-fitted,  with toes snug in the end of the boot when standing upright and slightly away from the end when in the snowboarding padding or  armor  is recommended on other body parts such as hips  knees  spine  and shoulders  to further help avoid injury to body parts  especially knees  it is recommended to use the right technique  to acquire the right technique  one should be taught by a qualified instructor  also  when snowboarding alone  precaution should be taken to avoid tree wells  a particularly dangerous area of loose snow that may form at the base of trees some care is also required when waxing a board as fluorocarbon waxes emit toxic fumes when overheated  waxing is best performed in a ventilated area with care being taken to use the wax at the correct temperature – the wax should be melted but not smoking or a study conducted to examine the types of snowboarding injuries and changes in injury patterns over time  data was collected on injured snowboarders and skiers in a base-lodge  clinic of a ski resort in vermont over 18  seasons (1988–2006)  and included extensive information about injury patterns  demographics  and experience  in conclusion of the study  the highest rate of injury was among young  inexperienced  female snowboarders  injury rates in snowboarders have fluctuated over time but still remain higher than skiers  no evidence was found that those who spend more time in terrain parks are over represented in the injury films have become a main part of progression in the sport  each season  many films are released  usually in autumn  these are made by many snowboard specific video production companies as well as manufacturing companies that use these films as a form of advertisement  snowboarding videos usually contain video footage of professional riders sponsored by companies  an example of commercial use of snowboarding films would be the white album  a film by snowboarding legend and filmmaker dave seoane about shaun white  that includes cameos by tony hawk and was sponsored by playstation  mountain dew and burton snowboards  snowboarding films are also used as documentation of snowboarding and showcasing of current trends and styles of the sport  in addition  the 2011  movie the art of flight showcased snowboarders such as travis rice attempting to attain greater feats in the sport of snowboarding however  sometimes the snowboarding industry is not supportive of all snowboarding-themed  films  in 2013,  the crash reel  a feature-length  documentary by filmmaker lucy walker about former shaun white rival kevin pearce  premiered on the film festival circuit to critical acclaim and was subsequently broadcast on hbo  using pearce s career-ending  traumatic brain injury and subsequent recovery as a backdrop  the film examines the physical dangers inherent to pro snowboarders and other extreme sports professional athletes under pressure by sponsors and the media to perform increasingly spectacular although there are significant references to various brands in the film  walker is  adamant  that the snowboarding industry did not sponsor the film in any way and in fact has been despite the film s mainstream media success snowboard magazines are integral in promoting the sport  although less so with the advent of the internet age  photo incentives are written into many professional riders  sponsorship contracts giving professionals not only a publicity but a financial incentive to have a photo published in a magazine  snowboard magazine staff travel with professional riders throughout the winter season and cover travel  contests  lifestyle  rider and company profiles  and product reviews  snowboard magazines have recently made a push to expand their brands to the online market  and there has also been a growth in online-only  publications  popular magazines kronicle  usa   transworld

the xbox and playstation  a plethora of online casual snowboarding games also exist along with games for mobile phone  more recently  snowboard simulators have been implemented as a way to practice during the off season or a way to learn
