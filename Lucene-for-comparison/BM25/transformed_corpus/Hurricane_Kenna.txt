 hurricane kenna -  wikipediahurricane kenna is tied as the third-most  intense pacific hurricane to strike the west coast of mexico in recorded kenna was the sixteenth tropical depression  thirteenth tropical storm  seventh hurricane  sixth major hurricane  and third category 5  hurricane of the 2002  pacific hurricane season  after forming on october 22  to the south of mexico from a tropical wave  forecasters consistently predicted the storm to strengthen much less than it actually did  moving into an area of favorable upper-level  conditions and warm sea surface temperatures  kenna quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 165  mph (265  km h  on october 25  while located about 255  mi (410  km  southwest of puerto vallarta  jalisco  weakening as it turned to the northeast  the hurricane struck near san blas  nayarit  with winds of 140  mph (225  km h  before dissipating on october 26  over the sierra madre occidental mountains the name  kenna  was retired from the list of pacific hurricane names due to its effects on mexico  which included us$101  million in damage and four deaths  the worst of the hurricane s effects occurred between san blas in nayarit and puerto vallarta in jalisco  where over 100  people were injured and thousands of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed  95%  of the buildings in san blas were damaged  and hundreds of buildings were destroyed along coastal areas of puerto vallarta the origin of hurricane kenna can be traced to a tropical wave moving westward through the caribbean sea on october 16,  possibly the same wave that passed near barbados two days earlier  the wave entered the eastern pacific ocean on october 19,  and a tropical disturbance along the wave axis gradually became better organized  conditions favored continued development  and dvorak classifications began late on october 20.  early on october 22,  the system developed into tropical depression fourteen-e  while located about 375  mi (605  km  south of manzanillo  initially the depression was disorganized  with little inner convective structure and sporadic deep convection  computer models predicted an increase in wind shear by 60  hours  as such the national hurricane center forecast the depression to strengthen to a peak strength of 45  mph (70  km h  before depression quickly became better organized with a great increase in convection near the center  and six hours after forming it strengthened into tropical storm kenna  upper-level  outflow and banding features improved in organization  as well  with warm water temperatures of over 29  °c (84  °f  and updated model forecasts anticipating light amounts of vertical wind shear  forecasters predicted kenna to slowly intensify to reach winds of 85  mph (135  km h  within 72  hours of october the storm moved to the west-northwest  around the periphery of a mid-level  high-pressure  system  and initially failed to strengthen further with much of its convection being associated with outer rainbands  on october 23,  the outer rainbands dissipated and convection became more concentrated near the center  which coincided with a steady increase in strength  late on october 23,  kenna intensified into a hurricane while located about 380  mi (615  km  southwest of after becoming a hurricane  kenna began to rapidly intensify with a 17  mi (27  km  wide eye located within its well-defined  central dense early on october 24  kenna became a major hurricane  and in a 24‑hour  period the hurricane more than doubled its windspeed from 70  mph (115  km h  winds to 145  mph (235  km h   after turning to the north and northeast in response to the flow ahead of a large mid to upper-level  trough  kenna attained peak winds of 165  mph (265  km h  early on october 25  while located about 255  mi (410  km  southwest of puerto vallarta  the third category 5  hurricane of the season  a reconnaissance aircraft flight into the hurricane while it was near peak intensity recorded a pressure of 913  mbar the fourth lowest recorded pressure for a pacific after peaking  wind shear from the approaching trough weakened the hurricane  and by six hours after reaching peak intensity  the winds in hurricane kenna dropped to 150  mph (240  km h  after the eye nearly dissipated  despite a 27  mbar increase in pressure in 12  hours  convective activity increased prior to kenna making landfall  on october 25  hurricane kenna struck near san blas in the state of nayarit with estimated winds of 140  mph (225  km h   the hurricane rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of western mexico  and the circulation dissipated on october 26  over the sierra madre occidental mountains  the remnants continued northeastward into the gulf of mexico and southeastern united 27  hours before landfall  mexican officials issued a hurricane watch from mazatlán to cabo corrientes  jalisco  with a tropical storm watch issued further south to manzanillo  six hours later when its track became more apparent  the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from mazatlán to la fortuna  with a tropical storm warning southward to 8,800  of the 9,000  residents in the landfall location  san blas  evacuated  which ultimately contributed to a low death officials ordered for the evacuation of 50,000  residents and fishermen along the southwest coast of mexico  including 3,000  in the islas 10,000  near mazatlán  and 15,000  near flood-prone  areas  civil authorities closed all schools and docks in potentially affected areas  the mexican red cross prepared for the storm by shipping 215  tonnes of relief supplies such as food  water  clothing  and medicine to the red cross branch in jalisco  assistance from the yucatán peninsula delivered 10  tonnes of food and water  as the mexican red cross prepared 20  emergency shelters in the state of officials took security measures in los cabos  baja california sur  where the asia-pacific  economic cooperation was meeting during the passage of the hurricane  early forecasts indicated a possible threat to the meeting  causing the government to prepare for a potential alternate officials recommended boats to stay at port due to severe official surface observations are available for the passage of the hurricane  upon making landfall  kenna was accompanied with an estimated 16  foot (4.9  m  storm surge in san blas  the surge also affected puerto vallarta  with reports of 10  foot (3  m  waves rushing inland from the bay  the hurricane dropped about 1.38  inches (35  mm  of precipitation while passing about 60  mi (95  km  east of the offshore archipelago  islas marías  there  sustained winds reached an estimated 106  mph (170  on land  kenna dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 18.91  inches (480  mm  at san ignacio  sinaloa  and 12.89  inches (327  mm  near manzanillo  the highest recorded sustained wind on land was about 100  mph (161  km h  at tepic  nayarit  with wind gusts at puerto vallarta reaching 50  mph (80  the hurricane also produced heavy rainfall in guerrero  michoacán  colima  and jalisco  and hit baja california sur with strong winds and rough
