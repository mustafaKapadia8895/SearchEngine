 doppler on wheels  or dow  is a fleet of x-band  radar trucks maintained by the center for severe weather research  cswr  in boulder  colorado led by principal investigator joshua wurman  with the funding largely provided by the national science foundation  nsf   the dow fleet and its associated mobile mesonet and pod deployable weather stations are lower atmospheric observing facilities  laof   national facilities  supporting a wide variety nsf-sponsored  research as of 2017,  there are three operational dows of a total of eight constructed since 1995.  all three are dual-polarization  dual-frequency  quick-scanning  doppler weather radars  several instrumented mobile mesonet pickup trucks host in situ weather instrumentation on 3.5  metres (11  ft  masts to complement the remote sensing radars  these mobile mesonets also carry approximately 20  instrumented  pods   which are ruggedized quickly deployable weather stations designed to survive inside tornadoes  tropical cyclones  and other adverse environments  the dow fleet is sometimes accompanied by a mobile operations and repair center  morc   a large van containing workstations for in-field  coordination  data management  and equipment repair the dow fleet has collected data in 200  tornadoes and inside the cores of 13  hurricanes  dows have been deployed to europe for the map and cops field programs  and to alaska twice for the jaws-juneau  projects  dows have operated as high as 12,700  feet (3,900  m  on bristol head and at 10,000  feet (3,000  m  for the ascii project at battle pass  three dows  mobile mesonets and pods were deployed for the owles lake-effect  snow study  the dows have participated in many field programs including  vortex  vortex2,  cops  map  ascii  ihop  scms  cases  rotate  pamrex  snowd-under,  flatland  hero  uidow  undeo the dow fleet was deployed to the nocturnal convection study  pecan  in juneâ€“july 2015.dow  data led to the discovery of sub-kilometer  hurricane boundary layer rolls  which likely modulate wind damage and may play a key role in hurricane intensification  dow data revealed the most intense winds ever recorded  bridge creek  3  may and the largest tornadic circulation ever documented  also 3  may 1999  in mulhall  and made the first 3d  maps of tornado winds and sub-tornadic  vortex winds  and documented intense vortices within lake-effect  snow bands  about 70  peer reviewed scientific publications have used dow data the dow fleet  pods  and mobile mesonets have been featured on tv  including discovery channel s reality series storm national geographic channel s specials tornado intercept and the true face of hurricanes  and pbs s nova episode  the hunt for the supertwister   and others
