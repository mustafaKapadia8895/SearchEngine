 lake-effect  snow is produced during cooler atmospheric conditions when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer lake water  warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake  rises up through the colder air above  freezes and is deposited on the leeward  downwind  same effect also occurs over bodies of salt water  when it is termed ocean-effect  or bay-effect  snow  the effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores  this uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation  which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour  often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall the areas affected by lake-effect  snow are called snowbelts  these include areas east of the great lakes  the west coasts of northern japan  the kamchatka peninsula in russia  and areas near the great salt lake  black sea  caspian sea  baltic sea  and parts of the northern atlantic ocean a lake-effect  blizzard is the blizzard-like  conditions resulting from lake-effect  snow  under certain conditions  strong winds can accompany lake-effect  snows creating blizzard-like  conditions  however the duration of the event is often slightly less than that required for a blizzard warning in both the us and canada if the air temperature is low enough to keep the precipitation frozen  it falls as lake-effect  snow  for lake-effect  rain or snow to form  the air moving across the lake must be significantly cooler than the surface air  which is likely to be near the temperature of the water surface   specifically  the air temperature at an altitude where the air pressure is 850  millibars (85  kpa   roughly 1.5  kilometers or 0.93  miles vertically  should be 13  °c (23  °f  lower than the temperature of the air at the surface  lake-effect  occurring when the air at 850  millibars (85  kpa  is much colder than the water surface can produce thundersnow  snow showers accompanied by lightning and thunder  caused by larger amounts of energy available from the increased instability  there are several key elements that are required to form lake-effect  precipitation and which determine its characteristics  instability  fetch  wind shear  upstream moisture  upwind lakes  synoptic (large)-scale  forcing  orography topography  and snow or ice cover a temperature difference of 13  °c (23  °f   or as past researchers have estimated  between 15  °c and 25  °c  between the lake temperature and the height in the atmosphere (~1,500  meters or 4,921  feet at which barometric pressure measures 850  millibars (85  kilopascals   provides for absolute instability and allows vigorous heat and moisture transportation vertically  atmospheric lapse rate and convective depth are directly affected by both the mesoscale lake environment and the synoptic environment  a deeper convective depth with increasingly steep lapse rates and a suitable moisture level will allow for thicker  taller lake effect precipitation clouds and naturally a much greater precipitation distance that an air mass travels over a body of water is called fetch  because most lakes are irregular in shape  different angular degrees of travel will yield different distances  typically a fetch of at least 100  km (62  mi  is required to produce lake effect precipitation  generally  the larger the fetch the more precipitation that will be produced  larger fetches provide the boundary layer with more time to become saturated with water vapor and for heat energy to move from the water to the air  as the air mass reaches the other side of the lake  the engine of rising and cooling water vapor pans itself out in the form of condensation and falls as snow  usually within 40  kilometers (25  miles  of the lake but sometimes up to about 100  shear is one of the most important factors governing the development of squalls  environments with weak directional shear typically produce more intense squalls than those with higher shear levels  if directional shear between the surface and the height in the atmosphere at which the barometric pressure measures 700  mb (70  kpa  is greater than 60  degrees  nothing more than flurries can be expected  if the directional shear between the body of water and the vertical height at which the pressure measures 700  mb (70  kpa  is between 30  and 60  degrees  weak lake-effect  bands are possible  in environments where the shear is less than 30  degrees  strong  well organized bands can be shear is less critical  but should be relatively uniform  the wind speed difference between the surface and vertical height at which the pressure reads 700  mb (70  kpa  should be no greater than 40  knots (74  km h  so as to prevent the upper portions of the band from shearing off  however  assuming the surface to 700  mb (70  kpa  winds are uniform  a faster overall velocity will work to transport moisture quicker from the water  and the band will travel much farther lower upstream relative humidity will make it more difficult and time consuming for lake effect condensation  clouds and precipitation to form  the opposite is true if the upstream moisture has a high relative humidity  allowing lake effect condensation  cloud and precipitation to form more readily and in a greater large body of water upwind will impact lake-effect  precipitation to the lee of a downwind lake by adding moisture or pre-existing  lake-effect  bands  which can re-intensify  over the downwind lake  upwind lakes do not always lead to an increase of precipitation advection aloft and large upscale ascent help increase mixing and the convective depth  while cold air advection lowers the temperature and increases lake-effect  precipitation will increase with elevation to the lee of the lake as topographic forcing squeezes out precipitation and dries out the squall much a lake gradually freezes over  its ability to produce lake-effect  precipitation decreases for two reasons  firstly  the open ice-free  liquid surface area of the lake shrinks  this reduces fetch distances  secondly  the water temperature nears freezing  reducing overall latent heat energy available to produce squalls  to end the production of lake-effect  precipitation  a complete freeze is often not when precipitation is not produced  cold air passing over warmer water may produce cloud cover  fast moving mid-latitude  cyclones  known as alberta clippers  often cross the great lakes  after the passage of a cold front  winds tend to switch to the northwest  and a frequent pattern is for a long-lasting  low-pressure  area to form over the canadian maritimes  which may pull cold northwestern air across the great lakes for a week or more  commonly identified with the negative phase of the north atlantic oscillation  nao   since the prevailing winter winds tend to be colder than the water for much of the winter  the southeastern shores of the lakes are almost constantly overcast  leading to the use of the term the great gray funk as a synonym for needed  these areas allegedly contain populations that suffer from high rates of seasonal affective disorder  a type of psychological depression thought to be caused by lack of winds in the winter typically prevail from the northwest in the great lakes region  producing the most dramatic lake-effect  snowfalls on the southern and eastern shores of the great lakes  this lake-effect  produces a significant difference between the snowfall on the southern eastern shores and the northern and western shores of the great lakes the most affected areas include upper michigan  central new york  western new york  northwestern pennsylvania  northeastern ohio  southwestern ontario and central ontario  northeastern illinois  along the shoreline of lake michigan   northwestern and northcentral indiana  mostly between gary  in and elkhart  in   and western michigan  tug hill in new york s north country region has the 2nd  most snow amounts of any non-mountainous  location within the continental u s   only trailing the upper peninsula of michigan  which can average over 200  inches (508  centimeters  of snow per snows on the tug hill plateau  east of lake ontario  can frequently set daily records for snowfall in the united states  tug hill receives  on average  over 20  feet (240  in  610  cm  of snow each in february 2007,  a prolonged lake-effect  snow event left 141  inches (358  cm  of snow on the tug hill syracuse  new york  is directly south of the tug hill plateau and receives significant lake-effect  snow from lake ontario  averaging 115.6  inches (294  cm  of snow per year  which is enough snowfall to often be considered one of the  snowiest  large cities in small amount of lake-effect  snow from the finger lakes falls in upstate new york as well  if the wind blows almost the entire length of either cayuga lake or seneca lake  ithaca or watkins glen respectfully can have a small lake effect snow storm  the appalachian mountains and atlantic ocean largely shield new york city and philadelphia from picking up any lake-effect  snow  snow there tends to come from mesocyclonic storm systems mixing with cold temperatures lake erie produces a similar effect for a zone stretching from the eastern suburbs of cleveland through erie to remnants of lake-effect  snows from lake erie have been observed to reach as far south as garrett county  maryland and as far east as geneva  new because it s not as deep as the other lakes  erie warms rapidly in the spring and summer and is frequently the only great lake to freeze over in winter  once frozen  the resulting ice cover alleviates lake-effect  snow downwind of the lake  based on stable isotope evidence from lake sediment coupled with historical records of increasing lake effect snow  it has been predicted that global warming will result in a further increase in lake effect very large snowbelt in the united states exists on the upper peninsula of michigan  near the cities of houghton  marquette  and munising  these areas average 250–300  inches (635–762  cm  of snow each for comparison  on the western shore  duluth  minnesota receives 78  inches (198  cm  per lake superior and lake huron rarely freeze because of their size and depth  hence  lake-effect  snow can fall continually in the upper peninsula and canadian snowbelts during the winter months  main areas of the upper peninsula snow belt include the keweenaw peninsula and baraga  marquette and alger counties  where lake superior contributes to lake-effect  snow  making them a prominent part of the midwestern snow belt  records of 390  inches (991  cm  of snow or more have been set in many communities in this area  the keweenaw peninsula averages more snowfall than almost anywhere in the united states—more than anywhere east of the mississippi river and the most of all non-mountainous  regions of the continental united states  because of the howling storms across lake superior  which cause dramatic amounts of precipitation  it has been said that the lake-effect  snow makes the keweenaw peninsula the snowiest place east of the rockies  only one official weather station exists in this region  located in hancock  michigan  this station averages well over 210  inches (533  cm  per year  farther north in the peninsula  lake-effect  snow can occur with any wind direction  the road commission in keweenaw county  michigan collects unofficial data in a community called delaware  and it strictly follows the guidelines set forth by the national weather service  this station averages over 240  inches (610  cm  per season  even farther north  a ski resort called mount bohemia receives an unofficial annual average of 273  inches (693  cm   herman  michigan  averages 236  inches (599  cm  of snow every year  lake-effect  snow can cause blinding whiteouts in just minutes  and some storms can last days western michigan  western northern lower michigan  and northern indiana can get heavy lake-effect  snows as winds pass over lake michigan and deposit snows over muskegon  traverse city  grand rapids  kalamazoo  new carlisle  south bend  and elkhart  but these snows abate significantly before lansing or fort wayne  indiana  when winds become northerly  or aligned between 330  and 390  degrees  a single band of lake-effect  snow may form  which extends down the length of lake michigan  this long fetch often produces a very intense  yet localized  area of heavy snowfall  affecting cities such as laporte and snow is uncommon in detroit  toledo  milwaukee  and chicago  because the region s dominant winds are from the northwest  making them upwind from their respective great lakes  however  they too can see lake-effect  snow during easterly or north-easterly  winds  more frequently  the north side of a low-pressure  system picks up more moisture over the lake as it travels west  creating a phenomenon called lake-enhanced  new york  after 82.3  inches (209  cm  of snow fell from december 24,  2001  to december 28,  2001fulton,  new york after a snowburst dropped 4–6  feet (122–183  cm  of snow over most of oswego county january 28–31,  2004.the  veteran s day storm of november 9–14,  1996  may be the most severe early season lake effect snow  les  storm the great lakes has witnessed in the past fifty years  at the height of the storm  over 160,000  customers were without power in greater cleveland alone  as the storm produced isolated snowfall tallies approaching 70  inches (178  cm  because southwestern ontario is surrounded by water on three sides  many parts of southwestern and central ontario get a large part of their winter snow from lake-effect  this region is notorious for the whiteouts which can suddenly reduce highway visibility on the world s busiest highway  ontario highway 401)  from clear to zero  the region most commonly affected spans from port stanley in the west  brantford and the bruce peninsula in the north  niagara-on-the-lake  to the east  and fort erie to the south  the heaviest accumulations usually happen in the bruce peninsula  which is between lake huron and georgian bay  so long as the great lakes are not frozen over  the only time the bruce peninsula does not get lake-effect  snow is when the wind is directly from the south toronto and hamilton are usually spared lake-effect  squalls because they are not on the leeward side of lake ontario during the dominant northwest winds  however  some central and northern portions of the greater toronto area can be affected a few times each year by lake-effect  snow from georgian bay  downtown toronto and hamilton get most of their lake-effect  snow when the wind comes from the southeast or east  over lake ontario  such easterly winds are usually associated with a winter cyclone passing just to the south of the great lakes when the wind is from the north  the snowbelt runs north-south  from grand bend to sarnia and london  areas such as lucan and arkona have experienced some of the heaviest snowsqualls from lake huron in this region  when the wind is slightly more westerly  the snowbelt runs from tobermory  owen sound  and grand bend to as far south and east as arthur  orangeville and caledon  this snowbelt often reaches kitchener and can affect the halton and peel regions of the greater toronto area  these northwesterly winds usually also bring snow southeast of georgian bay  which can reach beyond lake scugog  a westerly wind sends lake-effect  streamers east from owen sound to gravenhurst  barrie  and orillia  and may even reach as far south and east as york region in the greater toronto area  when the wind is from the southwest  lake-effect  streamers from lake huron and georgian bay run from noelville to sudbury  gravenhurst  and algonquin provincial park  winds from this same direction coming over lake ontario will cause squalls to come ashore from cobourg through the belleville area to kingston and the thousand islands  with prince edward county being the area most vulnerable to extreme snowfall amounts  some snow bands can occasionally reach quebec and maine  while snow originating from lake erie  lake ontario and even lake michigan can impact southern ontario  easterly winds primarily affect the niagara peninsula  local lake-effect  snowsqualls can occasionally occur downwind of lake simcoe when the lake is unfrozen  usually in early winter or late fall lake superior has its own independent snowbelts  affecting wawa  sault ste  marie  marathon  the keweenaw peninsula in upper michigan  and pukaskwa national park  thunder bay is usually not affected by lake-effect  snow  unless it is associated with a winter storm similar snowfall can occur near large inland bays  where it is known as bay-effect  snow  bay-effect  snows fall downwind of delaware bay  chesapeake bay  and massachusetts bay when the basic criteria are met  and on rarer occasions along long island the southern and southeastern sides of the great salt lake receive significant lake-effect  snow  since the great salt lake never freezes  the lake effect can influence the weather along the wasatch front year-round.  the lake effect largely contributes to the 55–80  inches (140–203  cm  annual snowfall amounts recorded south and east of the lake  and in average snowfall reaching 500  inches (13  m  in the wasatch range  the snow  which is often very light and dry because of the semi-arid  climate  is referred to as  the greatest snow on earth  in the mountains  lake-effect  snow contributes to approximately 6–8  snowfalls per year in salt lake city  with approximately 10%  of the city s precipitation being contributed by the finger lakes of new york are long enough for lake-effect  precipitation the texas twin cities of sherman and denison are known  in rare instances  to have experienced lake-effect  snow from nearby lake texoma due to the lake s size  it is the third-largest  lake in texas or along its borders  on one occasion in december 2016,  lake effect snow fell in central mississippi from a lake band off ross barnett truckee meadows and other parts of northern nevada which are normally in the rain shadow of the sierra nevada can  when conditions are right  have severe snowfall as a result of lake effect from lake tahoe  recent severe examples of this phenomenon have occurred as recently as 2004,  dumping several feet of snow in the normally dry region the west coast occasionally experiences ocean-effect  showers  usually in the form of rain at lower elevations south of about the mouth of the columbia river  these occur whenever an arctic air mass from western canada is drawn westward out over the pacific ocean  typically by way of the fraser valley  returning shoreward around a center of low pressure  cold air flowing southwest from the fraser valley can also pick up moisture over the strait of georgia and strait of juan de fuca  then rise over the northeastern slopes of the olympic mountains  producing heavy  localized snow between port angeles and sequim  as well as areas in kitsap county and the puget sound the phenomenon of gulf-effect  snow has been observed along the northern coast of the gulf of mexico  notably during florida s great blizzard of 1899.  another extreme occurrence of  ocean effect  snow occurred on january 24,  2003,  when wind off the atlantic  combined with air temperatures in the 20  °f (−7  °c   brought snow flurries to the atlantic coast of florida as far south as cape winnipeg and lake winnipegosis in manitoba historically have seen lake-effect  snow as early as late october  and it is common throughout early to mid november  towards the end of november the lakes sufficiently cool and begin to freeze ending the lake effect snow  a brief period of lake-effect  snow is also common near great bear lake and great slave lake in the northwest territories during early winter  usually early to mid october   however the lake-effect  season for both lakes is very short  the lakes are frozen roughly eight months of the year and as a result have very little time to warm during the summer months other small lakes such as lake athabasca in northern saskatchewan and lake nipigon in northwestern ontario produce early season lake-effect  snows  smallwood reservoir  a man-made  lake located in labrador has on occasion generated lake-effect  snow the canadian maritimes  specifically nova scotia and prince edward island  are often affected by such snow squalls when an arctic winter airmass moves over unfrozen waters  in pei  sea-effect  snow is often generated when a cold north wind blows over the unfrozen gulf of st  lawrence  dumping heavy snow on the north shore  in nova scotia  a cold north-west  wind can produce sea-effect  snow over the cape breton highlands from the gulf of st  lawrence  and the annapolis valley from the bay of fundy  in the latter case  the sea-effect  snow season can continue all winter as the bay of fundy remains open owing to its extreme tidal currents.lake-effect  or sea-effect  snow occurs in other countries  near large lakes or large sea areas  in eurasia  it occurs in the regions of the black sea in georgia and turkey  the adriatic sea in italy  the north sea  the aegean sea  the balearic islands  the baltic sea as well as areas surrounding the sea of japan because the southern black sea is relatively warm  around 13  °c or 55  °f at the beginning of winter  typically 10  to 6  °c or 50  to 43  °f by the end   sufficiently cold air aloft can create significant snowfalls in a relatively short period of time  due to its location on a peninsula between the black sea and the sea of marmara  istanbul is very prone to lake-effect  snow and this weather phenomenon occurs almost every winter  this type of precipitation is generated by the warmer black sea temperature and colder air temperature  over the istanbul area  in february 2005,  a lake-effect  snowfall left 50  centimeters (20  in  of snow  and in march 1987,  a three-week-long  lake-effect  snowfall accompanied with strong winds (lake-effect  blizzard  left 80  centimeters (31  in  of snow in the snowfall in the eastern regions of the black sea is amplified by the orographic effect of the nearby caucasus mountains  often resulting in snowfall of several meters  especially at higher elevations in northern europe  cold  dry air masses from russia can blow over the baltic sea and cause heavy snow squalls on areas of the southern and eastern coasts of sweden  as well as on the danish island of bornholm and the east coast of jutland in the united kingdom  easterly winds bringing cold continental air across the north sea can lead to a similar phenomenon  locally it is also known as "lake-effect  snow  despite the snow coming in from the sea rather than a similarly during a north-westerly  wind  snow showers can form coming in from the liverpool bay  coming down the cheshire gap  causing snowfall in the west midlands—this formation resulted in the white christmas of 2004,  in the area  a similar phenomenon can affect the city of inverness in the scottish highlands  where cold north east winds cause heavy snow to form in the moray firth  this was the case with the white hogmanay of 2009,  which caused the street party to be canceled  northerly and north-westerly  winds can cause the effect to occur over the irish sea and bristol channel feeding snow into south-west  england and eastern ireland  western scotland and the north of ireland can also see snow showers from a north or north-westerly  wind over the atlantic since the north sea is relatively warm  around 13  °c or 55.4  °f at the beginning of winter  typically 10  to 6  °c or 50  to 43  °f by the end   sufficiently cold air aloft can create significant snowfalls in a relatively short period of time  the best-known  example occurred in january 1987,  when record-breaking  cold air  associated with an upper low  moved across the north sea towards the uk  the end result was over a foot of snow for coastal areas  leading to communities being cut off for over a week  in recent years  lake-effect  snow has been much lighter similarly  northern winds blowing across the relatively warm waters of the english channel during cold spells can bring significant snowfall to the french region of normandy  where snow drifts exceeding ten feet (3  m  were measured in march sea of japan creates snowfall in the mountainous western japanese prefectures of niigata and nagano  parts of which are known collectively as snow country   yukiguni    in addition to the sea of japan  other parts of japan  as well as korea and scandinavia  experience these same conditions because the aegean sea  greece   is warm in the winter  when cold air masses from siberia advance in the area  they pick up lots of moisture  resulting in heavy snowfalls in eastern central greece  eastern thessaly  eastern peloponnese  south-eastern  chalkidiki  the cyclades and crete  more commonly in the mountainous areas   in 2008  a severe snowstorm blanketed athens dropping 40cm  of snow and causing huge traffic jams moving of polar or siberian high pressure centers along caspian sea regarding to relatively warmer water of this sea can make heavy snowfalls in the northern coast of iran  several blizzards have been reported in this region during the last decades  in feb 2014  heavy snowfall reached two meters in the coast line in gilan and mazandaran provinces of iran  the heaviest snowfall was reported in abkenar village near anzali lagoon about lake-effect  snow
