fundraising was lackluster  she was forced out in 1904.  professional social work experts took control and made the group a model of progressive era scientific new leader mabel thorp boardman constantly consulted with senior government officials  military officers  social workers and financiers  william howard taft was especially influential  they imposed an ethos of  managerialism   transforming the agency from barton s cult of personality to an  organizational humanitarianism  ready for is a nationwide network of more than 650  chapters and 36  blood service regions  approximately 500,000  red cross volunteers  including femacorps and americorps members  and 30,000  employees annually mobilize relief to people affected by more than 67,000  disasters  train almost 12  million people in necessary medical skills and exchange more than a million emergency messages for u s  military service personnel and their family members  arc is the largest supplier of blood and blood products to more than 3,000  hospitals and assists victims of international disasters and conflicts worldwide  in 2006  the organization had over $6  billion in total revenues  revenue from

legislation clarified the role for the board of governors and that of the senior management in the wake of difficulties following hurricane 1996,  the chronicle of philanthropy  an industry magazine  released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit  organization popularity and credibility  the study showed that arc was ranked as the third  most popular charity/non-profit  in america  of over 100  charities researched with 48%  of americans over the age of 12  choosing  love   and  like a lot  to describe the red supplies roughly 40%  of the donated blood in the united

1999,  arc became the first u s  blood bank to implement a nucleic acid testing  nat  study  this process is different from traditional testing because it looks for the genetic material of hiv and hepatitis c  hcv   rather than the body s response to the disease the nat tests for hiv and hcv have been licensed by the u s food and drug administration  fda   these tests detect the genetic material of a transfusion-transmitted  virus like hiv without waiting for the body to form antibodies  potentially offering an important time advantage over current techniques leukocytes  white blood cells  help fight off foreign substances such as bacteria  viruses and abnormal cells  in fact  these foreign leukocytes in transfused red blood cells and platelets are often not well tolerated and have been associated with some types of transfusion complications  leukocytes in stored blood products can have a variety of biological effects  including depression of immune function  which can result in organ failure and because whole blood is rarely used for transfusion and not kept in routine inventory  leukoreduced red blood supplies are critical  after collection the whole blood is separated into red cells and plasma by centrifugation  a preservative solution is mixed with the red cells and the component is filtered with a leukoreduction filter  shelf life for this product is 42  days arc is moving toward system-wide  universal prestorage leukocyte reduction to improve patient care  from 1976  through 1985,  the fda received reports of 355  fatalities associated with transfusion  99  of which were excluded from further review because they were unrelated to transfusion or involved hepatitis or acquired immune deficiency while the fda has not yet made a leukoreduction a requirement  arc took a leading role in implementing this procedure with a goal of leukoreducing all blood products  more than 70  percent of arc red blood cell components undergo prestorage leukoreduction  a filtering process that is done soon after blood is donated arc operates the jerome h  holland blood laboratory in rockville  maryland  each the red cross invests more than $25  million in research activities at the holland laboratory and in the field arc offers cellular therapies  this treatment involves collecting and treating blood cells from a patient or other blood donor  the treated cells are then introduced into a patient to help revive normal cell function  replace cells that are lost as a result of disease  accidents or aging  or to prevent illnesses from appearing arc provides first aid  cardiopulmonary resuscitation  cpr   automated external defibrillator  aed   water safety and lifeguarding  babysitting  disaster preparedness and home safety

explosions and other natural and man-made  disasters although arc is not a government agency  its authority to provide disaster relief was formalized when  in 1905,  it was granted a congressional charter to  carry on a system of national and international relief in time of peace and apply the same in mitigating the sufferings caused by pestilence  famine  fire  floods  and other great national calamities  and to devise and carry on measures for preventing the same   the charter is not only a grant of power  but also an imposition of duties and obligations to the nation  to disaster victims

to the general public a major misconception among the general public is that arc provides medical facilities  engages in search and rescue operations or deploys ambulances  instead  first responder roles are left to government agencies as dictated by the national response framework  red cross societies outside the u s  may provide such functions  for example  the cruz roja mexicana  mexican red cross  runs a national ambulance service  furthermore  american red cross emergency response vehicles  ervs  look similar to ambulances  these ervs instead are designed for bulk distribution of relief supplies  such as meals  drinks and other relief supplies  although arc shelters usually assign a nurse to the facility  they are not equipped to provide medical care beyond first aid the disaster

shelters for displaced residents and started the distribution of food  water and relief the collapse of the i-35w  mississippi river bridge  the twin cities area chapter responded with their disaster action team to provide food  information and comfort  a family service center was set up  and mental health counselors deployed to numerous donations contributed for this cause totaled us$138,368  and covered the cost of but not $65,000  in unexpected weather and the collapse placed 70%  of minnesota counties in federal primary or contiguous disaster areas during that as part of the international red cross and red crescent movement and its nearly 100  million volunteers  educates and mobilizes communities to overcome life-threatening  vulnerabilities  arc international services department focuses on global health  disaster preparedness and response  restoring family links and international humanitarian law dissemination  arc is involved with international projects such as the measles initiative  malaria programs in africa  disaster response and relief efforts in response to the 2004  south asia tsunami arc international disaster response and preparedness programs provide relief and development assistance to millions of people annually who suffer as a result of natural and human-made  disasters  to respond quickly and effectively  arc has pre-positioned  emergency relief supplies in three warehouses managed by the international federation in dubai  malaysia and panama that are used to respond to disasters  an emergency response unit  eru  is another method with which arc responds to international emergencies  an eru is made up of trained personnel and pre-packaged  equipment that is crucial in responding to sudden  large-scale  disasters and emergencies in remote locations  american red cross erus specialize in providing emergency relief supplies and it and telecommunications for red cross response january 12,  2010,  a magnitude 7.0  mw earthquake struck the haitian coast 10  miles from the capital of port-au-prince,  causing massive damage  more than 200,000  deaths and displacing nearly 2  million people as of march 2011,  arc announced it had allocated $314  million for haiti earthquake relief and recovery  arc funded recovery projects to provide transitional homes  health services  disaster preparedness  water and sanitation improvements and livelihoods development  it provided funds for school fees for affected families  as of june 2011,  arc had raised approximately $484  million for haiti relief and recovery series of blistering reports by npr and propublica  however  found that much of the money americans donated never made it to help people in haiti and promises to rebuild neighborhoods were never international services global health initiatives focus on preventing and combating infectious diseases such as hiv aids and measles on a large scale  through cost-effective,  community-based  health interventions  arc targets people in need and focuses on accessibility and equity of care  community participation and integration with other community development initiatives  such as water and sanitation projects and food and nutrition programs an example of arc international services health programming is the measles initiative  launched in 2001,  as a partnership committed to reducing measles deaths globally  the initiative provides technical and financial support to governments and communities on vaccination campaigns and disease surveillance worldwide  leading these efforts are arc  the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  the united nations foundation  unicef and the world health organization  the measles initiative has supported vaccination campaigns in more than 60  countries  mostly

members  restoring family links services provides the exchange of hand-written  red cross messages between individuals and their relatives who may be refugees or prisoners of war  at any given time  arc restoring family links program is handling the aftermath of 20–30  wars and conflicts  the worldwide structure of red cross and red crescent national societies and the international committee of the red cross make this service possible  when new information from former soviet union archives became available in the 1990s,  a special unit was created to handle world war ii and holocaust tracing services arc international services educates the american public about the guiding principles of international humanitarian law  ihl  for conduct in warfare as set forth by the geneva conventions of 1949.  in doing so  arc international services provides support to arc chapters in their ihl dissemination efforts  offering courses and providing instructor training arc provides emergency and non-emergency  services to the united states military  the most notable service is emergency family communications  where families can contact the red cross to send important family messages  such as a death in the family  or new birth   arc can also act as a verifying the agency operates call centers to provide these arc works closely with other military societies  such as the department of veterans affairs  to provide other services to service members and their families  arc is not involved with prisoners of war  these are monitored by the international committee of the red cross  an international body one criticism of red cross services to the military stems from stories about arc charging troops during the second world war and korean war token fees for  comfort items  such as toothpaste  coffee  donuts  and cigarettes and for off-base  food and lodging  the fee suggestion had been made in a letter dated march 1942  from the secretary of war henry l  stimson to norman h  davis  the chairman of arc  the suggestion was that allied soldiers were being charged money so americans should be charged too so as to  ensure an equitable distribution among all service personnel of red cross the red cross adopted the secretary s suggestion as a june 18,  1945,  address to congress  general dwight d  eisenhower said of the red cross service in world war ii   the red cross  with its clubs for recreation  its coffee and doughnuts in the forward areas  its readiness to meet the needs of the well and to help minister to the wounded has often seemed the friendly hand of this nation  reaching across the sea to sustain its fighting an account of one world war ii american red cross girl is recorded in destination unknown by kathleen cox  her mother  leona cox  was recruited to red cross service by a fellow teacher at allegheny another account of an american red cross world war ii worker is related in letters by evelyn merritt welden  compiled in the book how to play

united states army the  donut dollies  provided morale-boosting  games to soldiers  due to the mobility of the uh-1  iroquois  vietnam donut dollies were able to visit troops in forward operating positions  the 2008  documentary film a touch of home  the vietnam war s red cross girls tells the story of these women  arc also provided services to entertain wounded soldiers at the great lakes naval hospital during the vietnam war  twins jennie and terrie frankel  known for their portrayal of the  doublemint twins   made several visits to the hospital in the late 1960s  to perform with their accordions and sing folk songs with their guitar and received letters of thanks from hospital field director  carolyn f  norton and recreation supervisor  edna r  schweitzer in 2011,  the service to the armed forces  saf  unit was reorganized and began receiving $24  million per year from congress for operating expenses  along with being downsized there was a consolidation into four regional locations  san diego  ca  ft  sill  ok  louisville  ky  and springfield  ma   in 2012  the first stories began breaking about long call times and the poor quality of response from call along with questions about whether money was being used in 2015,  the san diego and springfield locations were closed because an online option for families was august 7,  johnson   johnson  j j  filed suit against arc over its sublicensing of the red cross image for the production of first aid kits and similar products  which it alleged competed with the company s products  the suit also asked for the destruction of all non-johnson    johnson red cross emblem bearing products and demanded that arc pay punitive damages and j j s legal fees the red cross  position was that it had licensed its name to first aid kit makers in an effort to encourage readiness for disasters and that license revenues supported humanitarian j j claimed that the red cross s commercial ventures were outside the scope of historically well-agreed  usage and were in direct violation of federal may 14,  2008,  a federal judge ruled against in june 2008,  the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached allowing both parties to use the fda took court action against arc in response to deficiencies in their procedures for ensuring blood supply safety  the resulting consent decree outlines violations of federal law that arc engaged in before arc paid millions of dollars in fines arc biomedical services instituted a standardized computer system to maintain the blood donor database  five national testing laboratories  ntls  that test some six million units of blood the charles drew biomedical institute  which provides training and other educational resources to red cross blood services  personnel  a quality assurance regulatory affairs department  which helps to ensure regulatory compliance  and  a centrally managed blood inventory system the consent decree was amended in 2003  with penalties for specific violations the fda could impose penalties after april 2003  up to the following maximum amounts the fda continued to apply pressure and fines to arc in order to enforce compliance with regulations  including a $1.7  million fine in june worked closely with the fda to develop a more robust system  the systems resulted in a five-year  period of sustained compliance that led to the release from the consent decree as of december 4,  the aftermath of the september 11,  2001  attacks  arc and other charitable organizations solicited funds and blood donations  dr  bernadine healy  the president of arc  appeared on telethons urging individuals to give needed  however  according to america s blood centers  the non-profit  consortium that provides the other 50%  of the united states blood supply  no national blood drive was needed  since localized blood drives in the affected areas would be sufficient to meet the demand  arc felt that the terrorist attacks were a sign of increased instability and urged people to donate blood  even though it was not needed at that time  in the end  some of the unused blood was created a  liberty fund  that was ostensibly designed for relief for victims of the terrorist attacks  however  when the fund was closed in october  after exceeding the goals of donations  only 30%  of the $547  million received was spent as the standard disaster relief guidelines for meeting victims needs had been supplied to them  dr  healy announced that the majority of the remainder of the money would be used to increase blood supply  improve telecommunications and prepare for future terror attacks in february 2002,  the new yorker magazine carried a column claiming that arc representatives were visiting upscale apartment buildings in wealthy manhattan neighborhoods and distributing donated money  up to three months  rent or mortgage payments  to new yorkers who had been  displaced  traumatized  or merely inconvenienced  by the terrorist attacks  without regard to whether the recipients were in financial donors felt that they had donated specifically to the victims of the september 11  attacks and objected to healy s official plan for the diversion of funds  survivors complained of the bureaucratic process involved in requesting funds and the slow delivery of the checks to meet immediate needs  congressional hearings were held and new york state attorney general eliot spitzer investigated the organization  in the end  arc appointed former us senator george mitchell to handle distribution of funds  healy was forced to resign and the red cross pledged that all funds would go to directly benefit attack healy received a severance payment of faced criticism from lesbian  gay  bisexual  and transgender  lgbt  advocacy organizations for prohibiting men who have sex with men  msm  from donating blood  this policy was an fda requirement for all blood collection companies and organizations in the united states  specifically  the fda instructs blood collection organizations to  defer for 12  months from the most recent sexual contact  a man who has had sex with another man during the past 12  consequently  arc was legally unable to collect blood from such men  in 2006,  along with the aabb and america s blood centers  arc petitioned the fda to remove the requirement from blood donations  citing better screening as of december 2016,  the american red cross reports on its website that its deferral of msm from donating blood for 12  months after any sexual contact with another man is aligned with the guidance issued by the u s  food and drug president  elizabeth dole overruled professional staff and ordered an hiv aids prevention manual to be rewritten to make references to homosexuality  premarital sex and condom use more responsive to conservative critics  according to the nation  which claimed that she allowed politics to affect many red cross march 2006,  investigations of allegations of fraud and theft by volunteers and contractors within arc katrina operations were launched by the louisiana attorney-general  and the federal bureau of investigation in response  arc increased its internal and external education of the organization s fraud and waste hotline for confidential reporting to a third party needed  the organization also elected to implement a background check policy for all volunteers and staff  starting in april 2006,  an unnamed former arc official leaked reports made by the international committee of the red cross and the british red cross  such reports are typical in a large-scale  disaster relief operation involving other national red cross societies to solicit their input  but are usually confidential and not released to the general public  these particular reports were particularly critical of arc operations in katrina-affected  regions  although the british red cross report strongly praised arc volunteers in their efforts in october 2014,  independent public interest news broadcasters npr and propublica published investigative reports on the red cross s handling of us east coast hurricanes sandy and isaac  citing internal red cross documents and interviews with former red cross and government officials  it criticized the organization s response in failing to meet the immediate needs of victims  it also
