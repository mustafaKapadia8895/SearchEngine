 the geostrophic wind   ˌdʒiːəˈstrɒfɪk  ˌdʒiːoʊ-,  is the theoretical wind that would result from an exact balance between the coriolis force and the pressure gradient force  this condition is called geostrophic balance  the geostrophic wind is directed parallel to isobars  lines of constant pressure at a given height   this balance seldom holds exactly in nature  the true wind almost always differs from the geostrophic wind due to other forces such as friction from the ground  thus  the actual wind would equal the geostrophic wind only if there were no friction and the isobars were perfectly straight  despite this  much of the atmosphere outside the tropics is close to geostrophic flow much of the time and it is a valuable first approximation  geostrophic flow in air or water is a zero-frequency  inertial wave air naturally moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure  due to the pressure gradient force  as soon as the air starts to move  however  the coriolis  force  deflects it  the deflection is to the right in the northern hemisphere  and to the left in the southern hemisphere  as the air moves from the high-pressure  area  its speed increases  and so does its coriolis deflection  the deflection increases until the coriolis and pressure gradient forces are in geostrophic balance  at this point  the air flow is no longer moving from high to low pressure  but instead moves along an isobar   note that this explanation assumes that the atmosphere starts in a geostrophically unbalanced state and describes how such a state would evolve into a balanced flow  in practice  the flow is nearly always balanced   the geostrophic balance helps to explain why  in the northern hemisphere  low-pressure  systems  or cyclones  spin counterclockwise and high-pressure  systems  or anticyclones  spin clockwise  and the opposite in the southern hemisphere flow of ocean water is also largely geostrophic  just as multiple weather balloons that measure pressure as a function of height in the atmosphere are used to map the atmospheric pressure field and infer the geostrophic wind  measurements of density as a function of depth in the ocean are used to infer geostrophic currents  satellite altimeters are also used to measure sea surface height anomaly  which permits a calculation of the geostrophic current at the surface the effect of friction  between the air and the land  breaks the geostrophic balance  friction slows the flow  lessening the effect of the coriolis force  as a result  the pressure gradient force has a greater effect and the air still moves from high pressure to low pressure  though with great deflection  this explains why high-pressure  system winds radiate out from the center of the system  while low-pressure  systems have winds that spiral inwards the geostrophic wind neglects frictional effects  which is usually a good approximation for the synoptic scale instantaneous flow in the midlatitude although ageostrophic terms are relatively small  they are essential for the time evolution of the flow and in particular are necessary for the growth and decay of storms  quasigeostrophic and semigeostrophic theory are used to model flows in the atmosphere more widely  these theories allow for divergence to take place and for weather systems to then develop newton s second law can be written as follows if only the pressure gradient  gravity  and friction act on an air parcel  where the bold symbolizes a vector here u is the velocity field of the air  ω is the angular velocity vector of the planet  ρ is the density of the air  p is the air pressure  fr is the friction  g is the acceleration vector due to gravity and d dt is the material derivative locally this can be expanded in cartesian coordinates  with a positive u representing an eastward direction and a positive v representing a northward direction  neglecting friction and vertical motion  as justified by the taylor–proudman theorem  we have with f   2ω  sin φ the coriolis parameter  approximately 6996100000000000000♠10−4  s−1,  varying with latitude  assuming geostrophic balance  the system is stationary and the first two equations become by substituting using the third equation above  we have with z the height of the constant pressure surface  satisfyingthis leads us to the following result for the geostrophic wind components  ug  vg  the validity of this approximation depends on the local rossby number  it is invalid at the equator  because f is equal to zero there  and therefore generally not used in the tropics other variants of the equation are possible  for example  the geostrophic wind vector can be expressed in terms of the gradient of the geopotential height φ on a surface of constant pressure
