 the great plains  sometimes simply  the plains   is the broad expanse of flat land  a plain   much of it covered in prairie  steppe  and grassland  that lies west of the mississippi river tallgrass prairie states and east of the rocky mountains in the united states and canada  it embracesand reaches intothe region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming the canadian portion of the plains is known as the prairies  it covers much of alberta and southern saskatchewan  and a narrow band of southern manitoba  despite covering a relatively small geographic area  the prairies are nevertheless home to the majority of each of the three provinces  respective populations the term  great plains  is used in the united states to describe a sub-section  of the even more vast interior plains physiographic division  which covers much of the interior of north america  it also has currency as a region of human geography  referring to the plains indians or the plains states in canada the term is little used  natural resources canada  the government department responsible for official mapping and equivalent to the united states geological survey  treats the interior plains as one unit consisting of several related plateaux and plains  there is no region referred to as the  great plains  in the atlas of in terms of human geography  the term prairie is more commonly used in canada  and the region is known as the prairie provinces or simply  the prairies  the north american environmental atlas  produced by the commission for environmental cooperation  a nafta agency composed of the geographical agencies of the mexican  american  and canadian governments  uses the  great plains  as an ecoregion synonymous with predominant prairies and grasslands rather than as physiographic region defined by the great plains ecoregion includes five sub-regions:  temperate prairies  west-central  semi-arid  prairies  south-central  semi-arid  prairies  texas louisiana coastal plains  and tamaulipus-texas  semi-arid  plain  which overlap or expand upon other great plains region is about 500  mi (800  km  east to west and 2,000  mi (3,200  km  north to south  much of the region was home to american bison herds until they were hunted to near extinction during the mid late 19th  century  it has an area of approximately 500,000  sq mi (1,300,000  km2).  current thinking regarding the geographic boundaries of the great plains is shown by this map at the center for great plains studies  university of term  great plains   for the region west of about the 96th  or 98th  meridian and east of the rocky mountains  was not generally used before the early 20th  century  nevin fenneman s 1916  study  physiographic subdivision of the united brought the term great plains into more widespread usage  before that the region was almost invariably called the high plains  in contrast to the lower prairie plains of the midwestern today the term  high plains  is used for a subregion of the great plains the great plains are the westernmost portion of the vast north american interior plains  which extend east to the appalachian plateau  the united states geological survey divides the great plains in the united states into ten physiographic subdivisions during the cretaceous period (145–66  million years ago   the great plains were covered by a shallow inland sea called the western interior seaway  however  during the late cretaceous to the paleocene (65–55  million years ago   the seaway had begun to recede  leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain which the seaway had once occupied during the cenozoic era  specifically about 25  million years ago during the miocene and pliocene epochs  the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands  existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread  the grasslands provided a new niche for mammals  including many ungulates and glires  that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets  traditionally  the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked  however  an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open  gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes in mammals  giving rise to the  grit  not grass  finds in the area have yielded bones of mammoths  saber-toothed  cats and other ancient as well as dozens of other megafauna  large animals over 100  lb kg   – such as giant sloths  horses  mastodons  and american lion – that dominated the area of the ancient great plains for thousands to millions of years  the vast majority of these animals became extinct in north america at the end of the pleistocene  around 13,000  years general  the great plains have a wide variety of weather through the year  with very cold and harsh winters and very hot and humid summers  wind speeds are often very high  especially in winter  grasslands are among the least protected humans have converted much of the prairies for agricultural purposes or to create pastures  the great plains have dust storms mostly every year or so the 100th  meridian roughly corresponds with the line that divides the great plains into an area that receive 20  in (510  mm  or more of rainfall per year and an area that receives less than 20  in (510  mm   in this context  the high plains  as well as southern alberta  south-western  saskatchewan and eastern montana are mainly semi arid steppe land and are generally characterised by rangeland or marginal farmland  the region  especially the high plains  is periodically subjected to extended periods of drought  high winds in the region may then generate devastating dust storms  the eastern great plains near the eastern boundary falls in the humid subtropical climate zone in the southern areas  and the northern and central areas fall in the humid continental climate many thunderstorms occur in the plains in the spring through summer  the southeastern portion of the great plains is the most tornado active area in the world and is sometimes referred to as tornado alley the great plains are part of the floristic north american prairies province  which extends from the rocky mountains to the appalachians the first americans (paleo-indians)  who arrived to the great plains were successive indigenous cultures who are known to have inhabited the great plains for thousands of years  over 15,000  years humans entered the north american continent in waves of migration  mostly over beringia  the bering straits land bridge historically the great plains were the range of the bison and of the culture of the plains indians  whose tribes included the blackfoot  crow  sioux  cheyenne  arapaho  comanche  and others  eastern portions of the great plains were inhabited by tribes who lived in semi-permanent  villages of earth lodges  such as the arikara  mandan  pawnee and wichita with the arrival of francisco vázquez de coronado  a spanish conquistador  the first recorded history of encounter between europeans and native americans in the great plains occurred in texas  kansas and nebraska from 1540  to 1542.  in that same time period  hernando de soto crossed a west-northwest  direction in what is now oklahoma and texas  today this is known as the de soto trail  the spanish thought the great plains were the location of the mythological quivira and cíbola  a place said to be rich in gold over the next one hundred years  founding of the fur trade brought thousands of ethnic europeans into the great plains  fur trappers from france  spain  britain  russia and the young united states made their way across much of the region  making regular contacts with native americans  after the united states acquired the louisiana purchase in 1803  and conducted the lewis and clark expedition in 1804–1806,  more information about the plains became available and various pioneers entered the areas manuel lisa  based in st  louis  established a major fur trading site at his fort lisa on the missouri river in nebraska  fur trading posts were often the basis of later settlements  through the 19th  century  more european americans and europeans migrated to the great plains as part of a vast westward expansion of population  new settlements became dotted across the great plains the new immigrants also brought diseases against which the native americans had no resistance  between a half and two-thirds  of the plains indians are thought to have died of smallpox by the time of the 1803  louisiana 1870,  the new railroads across the plains brought hunters who killed off almost all the bison for their hides  the railroads offered attractive packages of land and transportation to european farmers  who rushed to settle the land  they  and americans as well  also took advantage of the homestead laws to obtain free farms  land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns  and those reached by the railroad had a chance  while the others became ghost towns  in kansas  for example  nearly 5000  towns were mapped out  but by 1970  only 617  were actually operating  in the mid-20th  century  closeness to an interstate exchange determined whether a town would flourish or struggle for of the great plains became open range  or rangeland where cattle roamed free  hosting ranching operations where anyone was theoretically free to run cattle  in the spring and fall  ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves  treated animals and sorted the cattle for sale  such ranching began in texas and gradually moved northward  between 1866  and 1895,  cowboys herded 10  million cattle north to rail heads such as dodge city  and ogallala  nebraska  from there  cattle were shipped foreign investors  especially british  financed the great ranches of the era  overstocking of the range and the terrible winter of 1886  resulted in a disaster  with many cattle starved and frozen to death  theodore roosevelt  a rancher in the dakotas  lost his entire investment  he returned east to reenter politics  from then on  ranchers generally raised feed to ensure they could keep their cattle alive over winter to allow for agricultural development of the great plains and house a growing population  the us passed the homestead acts of 1862:  it allowed a settler to claim up to 160  acres (65  ha  of land  provided that he lived on it for a period of five years and cultivated it  the provisions were expanded under the kinkaid act of 1904  to include a homestead of an entire section  hundreds of thousands of people claimed such homesteads  sometimes building sod houses out of the very turf of their land  many of them were not skilled dryland farmers and failures were frequent  much of the plains were settled during relatively wet years  government experts did not understand how farmers should cultivate the prairies and gave advice counter to what would have needed   germans from russia who had previously farmed  under similar circumstances  in what is now ukraine were marginally more successful than other homesteaders  the dominion lands act of 1871  served a similar function for establishing homesteads on the prairies in railroads opened up the great plains for settlement  for now it was possible to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the east  and europe  homestead land was free for american settlers  railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established  immigrants poured in  especially from germany and scandinavia  on the plains  very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves  they clearly understood the need for a hard-working  wife  and numerous children  to handle the many chores  including child-rearing,  feeding and clothing the family  managing the housework  feeding the hired hands  and  especially after the 1930s,  handling paperwork and financial during the early years of settlement  farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors  after approximately one generation  women increasingly left the fields  thus redefining their roles within the family  new technology including sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles  the scientific housekeeping movement  promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents  as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning  advice columns for women regarding farm bookkeeping  and home economics courses in the the eastern image of farm life in the prairies emphasized the isolation of the lonely farmer and wife  plains residents created busy social lives for themselves  they often sponsored activities that combined work  food and entertainment such as barn raisings  corn huskings  quilting grange meetings  church activities and school functions  women organized shared meals and potluck events  as well as extended visits between the grange was a nationwide farmers  organization  they reserved high offices for women  and gave them a voice in public region roughly centered on the oklahoma panhandle  including southeastern colorado  southwestern kansas  the texas panhandle  and extreme northeastern new mexico was known as the dust bowl during the late 1920s  and early 1930s.  the effect of an extended drought  inappropriate cultivation  and financial crises of the great depression  forced many farmers off the land throughout the great plains from the 1950s  on  many areas of the great plains have become productive crop-growing  areas because of extensive irrigation on large landholdings  the united states is a major exporter of agricultural products  the southern portion of the great plains lies over the ogallala aquifer  a huge underground layer of water-bearing  strata dating from the last ice age  center pivot irrigation is used extensively in drier sections of the great plains  resulting in aquifer depletion at a rate that is greater than the ground s ability to rural plains have lost a third of their population since 1920.  several hundred thousand square miles of the great plains have fewer than 6  inhabitants per square mile (2.3  inhabitants per square kilometer —the density standard frederick jackson turner used to declare the american frontier  closed  in 1893.  many have fewer than 2  inhabitants per square mile (0.77  inhabitants per square kilometer   there are more than 6,000  ghost towns in the state of kansas alone  according to kansas historian daniel fitzgerald  this problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region  in addition  the smaller school-age  population has forced the consolidation of school districts and the closure of high schools in some communities  the continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the great plains is not and there has been a proposal – the  buffalo commons  – to return approximately 139,000  sq mi (360,000  km2)  of these drier parts to native prairie land the great plains contribute substantially to wind power in the united states  in july 2008,  oilman turned wind-farm  developer t  boone pickens called for the u s  to invest $1  trillion to build an additional 200,000  mw of wind power nameplate capacity in the plains  as part of his pickens plan  pickens cited sweetwater  texas as an example of economic revitalization driven by wind power was a struggling town typical of the plains  steadily losing businesses and population  until wind turbines came to the surrounding nolan wind power brought jobs to local residents  along with royalty payments to landowners who leased sites for turbines  reversing the town s population decline  pickens claims the same economic benefits are possible throughout the plains  which he refers to as north america s  wind corridor
