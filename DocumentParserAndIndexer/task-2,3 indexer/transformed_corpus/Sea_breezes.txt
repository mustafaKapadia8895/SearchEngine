 a sea breeze or onshore breeze is any wind that blows from a large body of water toward or onto a landmass  it develops due to differences in air pressure created by the differing heat capacities of water and dry land  as such  sea breezes are more localised than prevailing winds  because land absorbs solar radiation far more quickly than water  a sea breeze is a common occurrence along coasts after sunrise  by contrast  a land breeze or offshore breeze is the reverse effect  dry land also cools more quickly than water and  after sunset  a sea breeze dissipates and the wind instead flows from the land towards the sea  sea breezes and land breezes are both important factors in coastal regions  prevailing the term offshore wind may refer to any wind over open water wind farms are often situated near a coast to take advantage of the normal daily fluctuations of wind speed resulting from sea or land breezes  while many onshore wind farms and offshore wind farms do not rely on these winds  a nearshore wind farm is a type of offshore wind farm located on shallow coastal waters to take advantage of both sea and land breezes   for practical reasons  other offshore wind farms are situated further out to sea and rely on prevailing winds rather than sea breezes  the sea has a greater heat capacity than land  so the surface of the sea warms up more slowly than the as the temperature of the surface of the land rises  the land heats the air above it by conduction  the warming air expands and becomes less dense  decreasing the pressure over the land near the coast  the air above the sea has a relatively higher pressure  causing air near the coast to flow towards the lower pressure over land  the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land and the sea  if a strong offshore wind is present  that is  a wind greater than 8  knots (15  km h   and opposing the direction of a possible sea breeze  the sea breeze is not likely to sea-breeze  front is a weather front created by a sea breeze  also known as a convergence zone  the cold air from the sea meets the warmer air from the land and creates a boundary like a shallow cold front  when powerful this front creates cumulus clouds  and if the air is humid and unstable  the front can sometimes trigger thunderstorms  if the flow aloft is aligned with the direction of the sea breeze  places experiencing the sea breeze frontal passage will have benign  or fair  weather for the remainder of the day  at the front warm air continues to flow upward and cold air continually moves in to replace it and so the front moves progressively inland  its speed depends on whether it is assisted or hampered by the prevailing wind  and the strength of the thermal contrast between land and sea  at night  the sea breeze usually changes to a land breeze  due to a reversal of the same mechanisms thunderstorms caused by powerful sea breeze fronts frequently occur in florida  a peninsula surrounded on both the east and west by the atlantic ocean and gulf of mexico  respectively  during the wet season which typically lasts from june through september october  any direction that the winds are blowing would always be off the water  thus making florida the place most often struck by lightning in the united states  and one of the most on these storms also can produce significant hail due to the tremendous updraft it causes in the atmosphere especially during times when the upper atmosphere is cooler such as during the spring or fall on calm summer afternoons with little prevailing wind  sea breezes from both coasts may collide in the middle  creating especially severe storms down the center of the state  these thunderstorms can drift towards either the west or east coast depending on the relative strengths of the sea breezes  and sometimes survive to move out over the water at night  creating spectacular cloud-to-cloud  lightning shows for hours after due to its large size lake okeechobee may also contribute to this activity by creating its own lake breeze which collides with the east and west coast sea breezes in cuba similar sea breeze collisions with the northern and southern coasts sometimes lead to storms at night  the land cools off faster than the ocean due to differences in their heat capacity  which forces the dying of the daytime sea breeze as the temperature of the land approaches that of the ocean  if the land becomes cooler than the adjacent sea surface temperature  the air pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land  setting up a land breeze blowing from the land to the sea  as long as the environmental surface wind pattern is not strong enough to oppose it  if there is sufficient moisture and instability available  the land breeze can cause showers  or even thunderstorms  over the water  overnight thunderstorm development offshore due to the land breeze can be a good predictor for the activity on land the following day  as long as there are no expected changes to the weather pattern over the following 12â€“24  hours  this is mainly because the strength of the land breeze is weaker than the sea the land breeze will die once the land warms up again the next morning
