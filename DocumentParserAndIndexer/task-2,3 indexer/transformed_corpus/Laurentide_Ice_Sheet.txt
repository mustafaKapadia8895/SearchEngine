 the laurentide ice sheet was a massive sheet of ice that covered millions of square kilometers  including most of canada and a large portion of the northern united states  multiple times during the quaternary glacial epochs— from 2.588  ± 0.005  million years ago to the the last advance covered most of northern north america between c  95,000  and c  20,000  years before the present day  and among other geomorphological effects  gouged out the five great lakes and the hosts of smaller lakes of the canadian shield  these lakes extend from the eastern northwest territories  through most of northern canada  and the upper midwestern united states  minnesota  wisconsin  and michigan  to the finger lakes  through lake champlain and lake george areas of new york  across the northern appalachians into and through all of new england and nova scotia  at times  the ice sheet s southern margin included the present-day  sites of northeastern coastal towns and cities such as portsmouth  new hampshire  boston  new york city  and great lakes coastal cities and towns as far south as chicago and st  louis  missouri—and then followed quite precisely the present course of the missouri river up to the northern slopes of the cypress hills  beyond which it merged with the cordilleran ice sheet  the ice coverage extended approximately as far south as 38  degrees latitude in the ice sheet was the primary feature of the pleistocene epoch in north america  commonly referred to as the ice age  it was up to 2  mi (3.2  km  thick in nunavik  quebec  canada but much thinner at its edges where nunataks were common in hilly areas  it created much of the surface geology of southern canada and the northern united states  leaving behind glacially scoured valleys  moraines  eskers and glacial till  it also caused many changes to the shape  size  and drainage of the great lakes  as but one of many examples  near the end of the last ice age  lake iroquois extended well beyond the boundaries of present-day  lake ontario  and drained down the hudson river into the atlantic cycles of growth and melting were a decisive influence on global climate during its existence  this is because it served to divert the jet stream which would otherwise flow from the relatively warm pacific ocean through montana and minnesota to the south  this gave the southwestern united states  otherwise a desert  abundant rainfall during ice ages — in extreme contrast to most other parts of the world which became exceedingly dry  though the effect of ice sheets in europe had an analogous effect on the rainfall in afghanistan  parts of iran  possibly western pakistan in winter  as well as north africa its melting also caused major disruptions to the global climate cycle  because the huge influx of low-salinity  water into the arctic ocean via the mackenzie is believed to have disrupted the formation of north atlantic deep water  the very saline  cold  deep water that flows from the greenland sea  this interrupted the thermohaline circulation  creating the brief younger dryas cold epoch and a temporary re-advance  of the ice which did not retreat from nunavik until 6,500  years ago some have argued that huge influxes of fresh water stopped the feeding of the ice sheet and starved it  aiding the retreat that had already begun  this is a controversial position because it is known that the north atlantic was very cold throughout glacial periods and it is likely that the anticyclone on top of the ice sheet helped sustain it through moist easterly winds which encouraged snow-bearing  winds from the needed during the pre-illinoian  stage the laurentide ice sheet extended even farther south  advancing as far as the missouri and ohio river valleys the ultimate collapse of the laurentide ice sheet is also suspected to have influenced european agriculture indirectly through the rise of global sea levels canada s oldest ice is a 20,000-year-old  remnant of the laurentide ice sheet called the barnes ice cap  located on central baffin island
