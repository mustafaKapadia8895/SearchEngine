 an iceberg or ice mountain is a large piece of freshwater ice that has broken off a glacier or an ice shelf and is floating freely in open it may subsequently become frozen into pack ice  one form of sea ice   as it drifts into shallower waters  it may come into contact with the seabed  a process referred to as seabed gouging by ice  also  about 91%  of an iceberg is below the surface of the water the word  iceberg  is a partial loan translation from the dutch word ijsberg  literally meaning ice cognate to danish isbjerg  german eisberg  low saxon iesbarg and swedish isberg because the density of pure ice is about 920  kg/m3,  and that of seawater about 1025  kg/m3,  typically one-tenth  of the volume of an iceberg is above water  due to archimedes s principle   the shape of the underwater portion can be difficult to judge by looking at the portion above the surface  this has led to the expression  tip of the iceberg   for a problem or difficulty that is only a small manifestation of a larger problem icebergs generally range from 1  to 75  metres (3.3  to 246.1  ft  above sea level and weigh 100,000  to 200,000  metric tons (110,000  to 220,000  short tons   the largest known iceberg in the north atlantic was 168  metres (551  ft  above sea level  reported by the uscg icebreaker east wind in 1958,  making it the height of a 55-story  building  these icebergs originate from the glaciers of western greenland and may have an interior temperature of −15  to −20  °c (5  to −4  are usually confined by winds and currents to move close to the coast  the largest icebergs recorded have been calved  or broken off  from the ross ice shelf of antarctica  iceberg b-15,  photographed by satellite in 2000,  measured 295  by 37  kilometres (183  by 23  mi   with a surface area of 11,000  square kilometres (4,200  sq mi   the largest iceberg on record was an antarctic tabular iceberg of over 31,000  square kilometres (12,000  sq mi  by 97  kilometres (208  by 60  mi   sighted 150  miles (240  km  west of scott island  in the south pacific ocean  by the uss glacier on november 12,  1956.  this iceberg was larger than a piece of iceberg ice melts  a fizzing sound called the  bergie seltzer  is produced  this sound is made when the water-ice  interface reaches compressed air bubbles trapped in the ice  as this happens  each bubble bursts  making a  popping  sound  the bubbles contain air trapped in snow layers very early in the history of the ice  that eventually got buried to a given depth  up to several kilometers  and pressurized as it transformed into firn then to glacial addition to size classification  icebergs can be classified on the basis of their shape  the two basic types of iceberg forms are tabular and non-tabular.  tabular icebergs have steep sides and a flat top  much like a plateau  with a length-to-height  ratio of more than this type of iceberg  also known as an ice can be quite large  as in the case of pobeda ice island  antarctic icebergs formed by breaking off from an ice shelf  such as the ross ice shelf or filchner-ronne  ice shelf  are typically tabular  the largest icebergs in the world are formed this way.non-tabular  icebergs have different shapes and are monitored worldwide by the u s  national ice center  nic   established in 1995,  which produces analyses and forecasts of arctic  antarctic  great lakes and chesapeake bay ice conditions  more than 95%  of the data used in its sea ice analyses are derived from the remote sensors on polar-orbiting  satellites that survey these remote regions of the earth the nic is the only organization that names and tracks all antarctic icebergs  it assigns each iceberg larger than 10  nautical miles (19  km  along at least one axis a name composed of a letter indicating its point of origin and a running number  the letters used are as b15  calved from the ross ice shelf in 2000  and initially had an area of 11,000  square kilometres (4,200  sq mi   it broke apart in november 2002.  the largest remaining piece of it  iceberg b-15a,  with an area of 3,000  square kilometres (1,200  sq mi   was still the largest iceberg on earth until it ran aground and split into several pieces october 27,  2005,  an event that was observed by seismographs both on the iceberg and across it has been hypothesized that this breakup may also have been abetted by ocean swell generated by an alaskan storm 6  days earlier and 13,500  kilometres (8,400  mi  the 20th  century  several scientific bodies were established to study and monitor the icebergs  the international ice patrol  formed in 1914  in response to the april 1912  sinking of the titanic  which killed 1,517  of its 2,223  passengers and crew  monitors iceberg dangers near the grand banks of newfoundland and provides the  limits of all known ice  in that vicinity to the maritime community before the early 1910s,  there was no system in place to track icebergs to guard ships against collisions  most likely because they weren t considered a serious threat needed  ships had managed to survive even direct crashes  in 1907,  ss kronprinz wilhelm  a german liner  had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow  but was still able to complete her voyage  the april 1912  sinking of the titanic however changed all that  and created the demand for a system to observe icebergs  for the remainder of the ice season of that year  the united states navy patrolled the waters and monitored ice flow  in november 1913,  the international conference on the safety of life at sea met in london to devise a more permanent system of observing icebergs  within three months the participating maritime nations had formed the international ice patrol  iip   the goal of the iip was to collect data on meteorology and oceanography to measure currents  ice-flow,  ocean temperature  and salinity levels  they published their first records in 1921,  which allowed for a year-by-year  comparison of iceberg movement new technologies monitor icebergs  aerial surveillance of the seas in the early 1930s  allowed for the development of charter systems that could accurately detail the ocean currents and iceberg locations  in 1945,  experiments tested the effectiveness of radar in detecting icebergs  a decade later  oceanographic monitoring outposts were established for the purpose of collecting data  these outposts continue to serve in environmental study  a computer was first installed on a ship for the purpose of oceanographic monitoring in 1964,  which allowed for a faster evaluation of data  by the 1970s,  icebreaking ships were equipped with automatic transmissions of satellite photographs of ice in antarctica  systems for optical satellites had been developed but were still limited by weather conditions  in the 1980s,  drifting buoys were used in antarctic waters for oceanographic and climate research  they are equipped with sensors that measure ocean temperature and currents side looking airborne radar  slar  made it possible to acquire images regardless of weather conditions  on november 4,  1995,  canada launched radarsat-1.  developed by the canadian space agency  it provides images of earth for scientific and commercial purposes  this system was the first to use synthetic aperture radar  sar   which sends microwave energy to the ocean surface and records the reflections to track icebergs  the european space agency launched envisat  an observation satellite that orbits the earth s on march 1,  2002.  envisat employs advanced synthetic aperture radar  asar  technology  which can detect changes in surface height accurately  the canadian space agency launched radarsat-2  in december 2007,  which uses sar and multi-polarization  modes and follows the same orbit path as
