 in geography  latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north–south position of a point on the earth s surface  latitude is an angle  defined below  which ranges from 0°  at the equator to 90°   north or south  at the poles  lines of constant latitude  or parallels  run east–west as circles parallel to the equator  latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the earth  without qualification the term latitude should be taken to be the geodetic latitude as defined in the following sections  also defined are six auxiliary latitudes which are used in special applications two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of latitude and longitude  in the first step the physical surface is modeled by the geoid  a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses  the second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface  the simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere  but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid  the definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections  lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface  the latitude of a point on the actual surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface  the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface  latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the iso 19111  there are many different reference ellipsoids  the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique  this is stressed in the iso standard which states that  without the full specification of the coordinate reference system  coordinates  that is latitude and longitude  are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst   this is of great importance in accurate applications  such as a global positioning system  gps   but in common usage  where high accuracy is not required  the reference ellipsoid is not usually stated in english texts the latitude angle  defined below  is usually denoted by the greek lower-case  letter phi  φ or ϕ   it is measured in degrees  minutes and seconds or decimal degrees  north or south of the equator the precise measurement of latitude requires an understanding of the gravitational field of the earth  either to set up theodolites or to determine gps satellite orbits  the study of the figure of the earth together with its gravitational field is the science of geodesy this article relates to coordinate systems for the earth  it may be extended to cover the moon  planets and other celestial objects by a simple change of nomenclature the graticule is formed by the lines of constant latitude and constant longitude  which are constructed with reference to the rotation axis of the earth  the primary reference points are the poles where the axis of rotation of the earth intersects the reference surface  planes which contain the rotation axis intersect the surface at the meridians  and the angle between any one meridian plane and that through greenwich  the prime meridian  defines the longitude  meridians are lines of constant longitude  the plane through the centre of the earth and perpendicular to the rotation axis intersects the surface at a great circle called the equator  planes parallel to the equatorial plane intersect the surface in circles of constant latitude  these are the parallels  the equator has a latitude of 0°,  the north pole has a latitude of 90°  north  written 90°  n or +90°),  and the south pole has a latitude of 90°  south  written 90°  s or −90°).  the latitude of an arbitrary point is the angle between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface at that point  the normal to the surface of the sphere is along the radius vector the latitude  as defined in this way for the sphere  is often termed the spherical latitude  to avoid ambiguity with the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes defined in subsequent sections of this article besides the equator  four other parallels are of significance the plane of the earth s orbit about the sun is called the ecliptic  and the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the earth is the equatorial plane  the angle between the ecliptic and the equatorial plane is called variously the axial tilt  the obliquity  or the inclination of the ecliptic  and it is conventionally denoted by i  the latitude of the tropical circles is equal to i and the latitude of the polar circles is its complement (90°  -  i   the axis of rotation varies slowly over time and the values given here are those for the current epoch  the time variation is discussed more fully in the article on axial figure shows the geometry of a cross-section  of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the earth and the sun at the december solstice when the sun is overhead at some point of the tropic of capricorn  the south polar latitudes below the antarctic circle are in daylight  whilst the north polar latitudes above the arctic circle are in night  the situation is reversed at the june solstice  when the sun is overhead at the tropic of cancer  only at latitudes in between the two tropics is it possible for the sun to be directly overhead  at the zenith  on map projections there is no universal rule as to how meridians and parallels should appear  the examples below show the named parallels  as red lines  on the commonly used mercator projection and the transverse mercator projection  on the former the parallels are horizontal and the meridians are vertical  whereas on the latter there is no exact relationship of parallels and meridians with horizontal and vertical  both are complicated curves  on the sphere the normal passes through the centre and the latitude  φ  is therefore equal to the angle subtended at the centre by the meridian arc from the equator to the point concerned  if the meridian distance is denoted by m φ  thenwhere r denotes the mean radius of the earth  r is equal to 6,371  km or 3,959  miles  no higher accuracy is appropriate for r since higher-precision  results necessitate an ellipsoid model  with this value for r the meridian length of 1  degree of latitude on the sphere is 111.2  km or 69.1  miles  the length of 1  minute of latitude is 1.853  km or 1.151  miles  and this distance was formerly used as the basis of the nautical mile in 1687  isaac newton published the philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica  in which he proved that a rotating self-gravitating  fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate  this article uses the term ellipsoid in preference to the older term spheroid   newton s result was confirmed by geodetic measurements in the 18th  century   see meridian arc   an oblate ellipsoid is the three-dimensional  surface generated by the rotation of an ellipse about its shorter axis  minor axis    oblate ellipsoid of revolution  is abbreviated to  ellipsoid  in the remainder of this article   ellipsoids which do not have an axis of symmetry are termed triaxial  many different reference ellipsoids have been used in the history of geodesy  in pre-satellite  days they were devised to give a good fit to the geoid over the limited area of a survey but  with the advent of gps  it has become natural to use reference ellipsoids  such as wgs84)  with centre at the centre of mass of the earth and minor axis aligned to the rotation axis of the earth  these geocentric ellipsoids are usually within 100  m (330  ft  of the geoid  since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid  the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid  one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used  many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids  so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another  gps handsets include software to carry out datum transformations which link wgs84  to the local reference ellipsoid with its associated grid the shape of an ellipsoid of revolution is determined by the shape of the ellipse which is rotated about its minor  shorter  axis  two parameters are required  one is invariably the equatorial radius  which is the semi-major  axis  a  the other parameter is usually (1)  the polar radius or semi-minor  axis  b  or (2)  the  first  flattening  f  or (3)  the eccentricity  e  these parameters are not independent  they are related bymany other parameters  see ellipse  ellipsoid  appear in the study of geodesy  geophysics and map projections but they can all be expressed in terms of one or two members of the set a  b  f and e  both f and e are small and often appear in series expansions in calculations  they are of the order 1/300  and 0.08  respectively  values for a number of ellipsoids are given in figure of the earth  reference ellipsoids are usually defined by the semi-major  axis and the inverse flattening  1/f.  for example  the defining values for the wgs84  ellipsoid  used by all gps devices  which are derivedthe difference between the semi-major  and semi-minor  axes is about 21  km (13  miles  and as fraction of the semi-major  axis it equals the flattening  on a computer monitor the ellipsoid could be sized as 300  by 299  pixels  this would barely be distinguishable from a 300-by-300-pixel  sphere  so illustrations usually exaggerate the flattening the graticule on the ellipsoid is constructed in exactly the same way as on the sphere  the normal at a point on the surface of an ellipsoid does not pass through the centre  except for points on the equator or at the poles  but the definition of latitude remains unchanged as the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane  the terminology for latitude must be made more precise by distinguishing the importance of specifying the reference datum may be illustrated by a simple example  on the reference ellipsoid for wgs84,  the centre of the eiffel tower has a geodetic latitude of 48°  51′  29″  n  or 48.8583°  n and longitude of 2°  17′  40″  e or 2.2944°e.  the same coordinates on the datum ed50  define a point on the ground which is 140  metres (460  feet  distant from the needed  a web search may produce several different values for the latitude of the tower  the reference ellipsoid is rarely specified in meridian arc and standard it is shown that the distance along a meridian from latitude φ to the equator is given by  φ in radians where m φ  is the meridional radius of curvature the distance from the equator to the pole isfor wgs84  this distance is 7007100019657290000♠10001.965729  km the evaluation of the meridian distance integral is central to many studies in geodesy and map projection  it can be evaluated by expanding the integral by the binomial series and integrating term by term  see meridian arc for details  the length of the meridian arc between two given latitudes is given by replacing the limits of the integral by the latitudes concerned  the length of a small meridian arc is given the latitude difference is 1  degree  corresponding to π/180  radians  the arc distance is aboutthe distance in metres  correct to 0.01  metre  between latitudes ϕ   displaystyle  phi   − 0.5  degrees and ϕ   displaystyle  phi     0.5  degrees on the wgs84  spheroid isthe variation of this distance with latitude  on wgs84)  is shown in the table along with the length of a degree of longitude (east-west  distance  a calculator for any latitude is provided by the u s  government s national geospatial-intelligence  agency a nautical mile was defined as the length of one minute of arc along a meridian of a spherical earth  an ellipsoid model leads to a variation of the nautical mile with latitude  this was resolved by defining the nautical mile to be exactly 1,852  metres there are six auxiliary latitudes that have applications to special problems in geodesy  geophysics and the theory of map projections the definitions given in this section all relate to locations on the reference ellipsoid but the first two auxiliary latitudes  like the geodetic latitude  can be extended to define a three-dimensional  geographic coordinate system as discussed below  the remaining latitudes are not used in this way  they are used only as intermediate constructs in map projections of the reference ellipsoid to the plane or in calculations of geodesics on the ellipsoid  their numerical values are not of interest  for example  no one would need to calculate the authalic latitude of the eiffel tower the expressions below give the auxiliary latitudes in terms of the geodetic latitude  the semi-major  axis  a  and the eccentricity  e   for inverses see below   the forms given are  apart from notational variants  those in the standard reference for map projections  namely  map projections  a working manual  by j  p  derivations of these expressions may be found in and online publications by and geocentric latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and the radius from the centre to a point on the surface  the relation between the geocentric latitude  ψ  and the geodetic latitude  φ  is derived in the above references asthe geodetic and geocentric latitudes are equal at the equator and at the poles but at other latitudes they differ by a few minutes of arc  taking the value of the squared eccentricity as 0.0067   it depends on the choice of ellipsoid  the maximum difference of ϕ − ψ   displaystyle  phi {-}\psi    may be shown to be about 11.5  minutes of arc at a geodetic latitude of approximately 45°  reduced or parametric latitude  β  is defined by the radius drawn from the centre of the ellipsoid to that point q on the surrounding sphere  of radius a  which is the projection parallel to the earth s axis of a point p on the ellipsoid at latitude φ  it was introduced by and who solved problems for geodesics on the ellipsoid by transforming them to an equivalent problem for spherical geodesics by using this smaller latitude  bessel s notation  u φ   is also used in the current literature  the reduced latitude is related to the geodetic latitude alternative name arises from the parameterization of the equation of the ellipse describing a meridian section  in terms of cartesian coordinates p  the distance from the minor axis  and z  the distance above the equatorial plane  the equation of the ellipse is the cartesian coordinates of the point are parameterized bycayley suggested the term parametric latitude because of the form of these reduced latitude is not used in the theory of map projections  its most important application is in the theory of ellipsoid geodesics   vincenty  rectifying latitude  μ  is the meridian distance scaled so that its value at the poles is equal to 90  degrees or π/2  radians where the meridian distance from the equator to a latitude φ is  see meridian arc and the length of the meridian quadrant from the equator to the pole  the polar distance  isusing the rectifying latitude to define a latitude on a sphere of radiusdefines a projection from the ellipsoid to the sphere such that all meridians have true length and uniform scale  the sphere may then be projected to the plane with an equirectangular projection to give a double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane such that all meridians have true length and uniform meridian scale  an example of the use of the rectifying latitude is the equidistant conic projection   snyder  section the rectifying latitude is also of great importance in the construction of the transverse mercator projection the authalic  greek for same area  latitude  ξ  gives an area-preserving  transformation to a sphere whereandand the radius of the sphere is taken asan example of the use of the authalic latitude is the albers equal-area  conic conformal latitude  χ  gives an angle-preserving   conformal  transformation to the sphere where gd x  is the gudermannian function   see also mercator projection   the conformal latitude defines a transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of arbitrary radius such that the angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid is the same as the corresponding angle on the sphere  so that the shape of small elements is well preserved   a further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane  this is not the only way of generating such a conformal projection  for example  the  exact  version of the transverse mercator projection on the ellipsoid is not a double projection   it does  however  involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex plane  the isometric latitude is conventionally denoted by ψ  not to be confused with the geocentric latitude   it is used in the development of the ellipsoidal versions of the normal mercator projection and the transverse mercator projection  the name  isometric  arises from the fact that at any point on the ellipsoid equal increments of ψ and longitude λ give rise to equal distance displacements along the meridians and parallels respectively  the graticule defined by the lines of constant ψ and constant λ  divides the surface of the ellipsoid into a mesh of squares  of varying size   the isometric latitude is zero at the equator but rapidly diverges from the geodetic latitude  tending to infinity at the poles  the conventional notation is given in snyder  page the normal mercator projection  on the ellipsoid  this function defines the spacing of the parallels  if the length of the equator on the projection is e  units of length or pixels  then the distance  y  of a parallel of latitude φ from the equator isthe isometric latitude ψ is closely related to the conformal latitude χ the formulae in the previous sections give the auxiliary latitude in terms of the geodetic latitude  the expressions for the geocentric and reduced latitudes may be inverted directly but this is impossible in the four remaining cases  the rectifying  authalic  conformal  and isometric latitudes  there are two methods of proceeding  the first is a numerical inversion of the defining equation for each and every particular value of the auxiliary latitude  the methods available are fixed-point  iteration and newton–raphson root finding  the other  more useful  approach is to express the auxiliary latitude as a series in terms of the geodetic latitude and then invert the series by the method of lagrange reversion  such series are presented by adams who uses taylor series expansions and gives coefficients in terms of the derives series to arbitrary order by using the computer algebra package and expresses the coefficients in terms of both eccentricity and flattening  the series method is not applicable to the isometric latitude and one must use the conformal latitude in an intermediate step the following plot shows the magnitude of the difference between the geodetic latitude   denoted as the  common  latitude on the plot   and the auxiliary latitudes other than the isometric latitude  which diverges to infinity at the poles   in every case the geodetic latitude is the greater  the differences shown on the plot are in arc minutes  the horizontal resolution of the plot fails to make clear that the maxima of the curves are not at 45°  but calculation shows that they are within a few arc minutes of 45°.  some representative data points are given in the table following the plot  note the closeness of the conformal and geocentric latitudes  this was exploited in the days of hand calculators to expedite the construction of map geodetic latitude  or any of the auxiliary latitudes defined on the reference ellipsoid  constitutes with longitude a two-dimensional  coordinate system on that ellipsoid  to define the position of an arbitrary point it is necessary to extend such a coordinate system into three dimensions  three latitudes are used in this way  the geodetic  geocentric and reduced latitudes are used in geodetic coordinates  spherical polar coordinates and ellipsoidal coordinates respectively at an arbitrary point p consider the line pn which is normal to the reference ellipsoid  the geodetic coordinates p ɸ λ h  are the latitude and longitude of the point n on the ellipsoid and the distance pn  this height differs from the height above the geoid or a reference height such as that above mean sea level at a specified location  the direction of pn will also differ from the direction of a vertical plumb line  the relation of these different heights requires knowledge of the shape of the geoid and also the gravity field of the earth the geocentric latitude ψ is the complement of the polar angle θ in conventional spherical polar coordinates in which the coordinates of a point are p r θ λ  where r is the distance of p from the centre o  θ is the angle between the radius vector and the polar axis and λ is longitude  since the normal at a general point on the ellipsoid does not pass through the centre it is clear that points on the normal  which all have the same geodetic latitude  will have differing geocentric latitudes  spherical polar coordinate systems are used in the analysis of the gravity field the reduced latitude can also be extended to a three-dimensional  coordinate system  for a point p not on the reference ellipsoid (semi-axes  oa and ob  construct an auxiliary ellipsoid which is confocal  same foci f  f′  with the reference ellipsoid  the necessary condition is that the product ae of semi-major  axis and eccentricity is the same for both ellipsoids  let u be the semi-minor  axis  od  of the auxiliary ellipsoid  further let β be the reduced latitude of p on the auxiliary ellipsoid  the set  u β λ  define the ellipsoid these coordinates are the natural choice in models of the gravity field for a uniform distribution of mass bounded by the reference ellipsoid the relations between the above coordinate systems  and also cartesian coordinates are not presented here  the transformation between geodetic and cartesian coordinates may be found in geographic coordinate conversion  the relation of cartesian and spherical polars is given in spherical coordinate system  the relation of cartesian and ellipsoidal coordinates is discussed in latitude  φ  is the angle between the equatorial plane and the true vertical at a point on the surface  the true vertical  the direction of a plumb line  is also the direction of the gravity acceleration  the resultant of the gravitational acceleration (mass-based)  and the centrifugal acceleration at that astronomic latitude is calculated from angles measured between the zenith and stars whose declination is accurately known in general the true vertical at a point on the surface does not exactly coincide with either the normal to the reference ellipsoid or the normal to the geoid  the angle between the astronomic and geodetic normals is usually a few seconds of arc but it is important in the reason why it differs from the normal to the geoid is  because the geoid is an idealized  theoretical shape  at mean sea level   points on the real surface of the earth are usually above or below this idealized geoid surface and here the true vertical can vary slightly  also  the true vertical at a point at a specific time is influenced by tidal forces  which the theoretical geoid averages out astronomical latitude is not to be confused with declination  the coordinate astronomers use in a similar way to specify the angular position of stars north south of the celestial equator  see equatorial coordinates   nor with ecliptic latitude  the coordinate that astronomers use to specify the angular position of stars north south of the ecliptic  see ecliptic coordinates
