weapons in existence  capable of leveling in his account of norse mythology  snorri sturluson relates how the hammer was made by the dwarven brothers eitri and brokkr  and how its characteristically short handle was due to a mishap during its manufacture  similar hammers  ukonvasara  were a common symbol of the god of thunder in other north european mythologies old norse mjǫllnir  ˈmjɔlːnir  regularly becomes mjøllnir  ˈmjœlːnir  in old icelandic by the 13th  the modern icelandic form is mjölnir  norwegian and danish mjølner  swedish mjölner the name is derived from a proto-germanic  form  meldunjaz  from the germanic root of  malanan  to grind    melwan  old icelandic meldr  mjǫll  mjǫl  meal  yielding an interpretation of  the grinder  crusher  additionally  there is a suggestion that the mythological  thunder weapon  being named after the word for  grindstone  is of considerable  proto-indo-european   if not indo-hittite)  age  according to this suggestion  the divine thunder weapon  identified with lightning  of the storm god was imagined as a grindstone  russian molot and possibly hittite malatt-   sledgehammer  bludgeon    reflected in russian молния  molniya  and welsh mellt  lightning   possibly cognate with old norse mjuln the old norse texts  mjölnir is identified as hamarr  a hammer   a word that in old norse and some modern norwegian dialects can mean  hammer  as well as  stone  rock  cliff   ultimately derived from an indo-european  word for  stone  stone tool   h₂éḱmō  as such it is cognate with sanskrit aśman  meaning  stone  rock  stone tool  hammer  as well as account of the origin of mjölnir is found in skáldskaparmál from snorri s edda  in this story  loki bets his head with sindri  or eitri  and his brother brokkr that they could never succeed in making items more beautiful than those of the sons of ivaldi  the dwarves who created other precious items for the gods  odin s spear gungnir  and freyr s foldable boat skíðblaðnir  sindri and brokkr accept loki s bet and the two brothers begin working  they begin to work in their workshop and sindri puts a pig s skin in the forge and tells his brother  brokkr  never to stop working the bellows until he comes and takes out what he put in  loki  in disguise as a fly  comes and bites brokkr on the arm  nevertheless  he continues to pump the bellows then  sindri takes out gullinbursti  freyr s boar with shining bristles  next  sindri puts some gold in the forge and gives brokkr the same order  again  loki  still in the guise of a fly comes and  again  bites brokkr s neck twice as hard as he had bitten his arm  just as before  brokkr continues to work the bellows despite the pain  when sindri returns  he takes out draupnir  odin s ring  which drops eight duplicates of itself every ninth night finally  sindri puts some iron in the forge and tells brokkr not to stop pumping the bellows  loki comes a third time and this time bites brokkr on the eyelid even harder  the bite is so deep that it draws blood  the blood runs into brokkr s eyes and forces him stop working the bellows just long enough to wipe his eyes  this time  when sindri returns  he takes mjölnir out of the forge  the handle is shorter than sindri had planned and so the hammer can only be wielded with one hand despite the flaw in the handle  sindri and brokkr win the bet and go to take loki s head  however  loki worms his way out of the bet by pointing out that the dwarves would need to cut his neck to remove his head  but loki s neck was not part of the deal  as a consolation prize  brokkr sews loki s mouth shut to teach him a lesson the final product is then presented to thor  and its properties are described  as follows then he gave the hammer to thor  and said that thor might smite as hard as he desired  whatsoever might be before him  and the hammer would not fail  and if he threw it at anything  it would never miss  and never fly so far as not to return to his hand  and if be desired  he might keep it in his sark  it was so small  but indeed it was a flaw in the hammer that the fore-haft  was somewhat short   original  þá gaf hann þór hamarinn ok sagði  at hann myndi mega ljósta svá stórt sem hann vildi  hvat sem fyrir væri  at eigi myndi hamarrinn bila  ok ef hann yrpi honum til  þá myndi hann aldri missa ok aldri fljúga svá langt  at eigi myndi hann sækja heim hönd  ok ef þat vildi  þá var hann svá lítill  at hafa mátti serk sér  en þat var lýi á  ar forskeftit var heldr skammt  thor possessed a formidable chariot  which is drawn by two goats  tanngrisnir and tanngnjóstr  a belt  megingjörð  and iron gloves  járngreipr  were used to lift mjölnir  mjölnir is the focal point of some of thor s adventures this is clearly illustrated in a poem found in the poetic edda titled þrymskviða  the myth relates that the giant  þrymr  steals mjölnir from thor and then demands the goddess freyja in exchange  loki  the god notorious for his duplicity  conspires with the other æsir to recover mjölnir by disguising thor as freyja and presenting him as the  goddess  to þrymr at a banquet þrymr holds in honor of the impending union  þrymr takes the bait  unable to contain his passion for his new maiden with long  blond locks  and broad shoulders   as þrymr approaches the bride by placing mjölnir on  her  lap  thor rips off his disguise and destroys þrymr and his giant cohorts a precedent of these viking age thor s hammer amulets are recorded for the migration period alemanni  who took to wearing roman  hercules  clubs  as symbols of a possible remnant of these donar amulets was recorded in 1897,  as a custom of unterinn  south tyrolian alps  of incising a t-shape  above front doors for protection against evils of all kinds  especially 50  specimens of mjölnir amulets have been found widely dispersed throughout scandinavia  dating from the 9th  to 11th  centuries  most commonly discovered in areas with a strong christian influence including southern norway  south-eastern  sweden  and due to the similarity of equal-armed,  square crosses featuring figures of christ on them at around the same time  the wearing of thor s hammers as pendants may have come into fashion in defiance of the square amulets worn by newly converted christians in the iron thor s hammer pendant excavated in yorkshire  dating to ca  ad 1000  bears an uncial inscription preceded and followed by a cross  interpreted as indicating a christian owner synchronising pagan and christian 10th-century  soapstone mold found at trendgården  jutland  denmark is notable for allowing the casting of both crucifix and thor s hammer a silver specimen found near fossi  iceland  now in the national museum of iceland  can be interpreted as either a christian cross or a thor s hammer  unusually  the elongated limb of the cross ends in a beast s  perhaps a wolf s  head the købelev runic-thor’s  hammer  found at the danish island of lolland in 2014,  is so far the only one bearing an inscription  proving that this kind of pendant is meant to be a hammer  the inscription reads  hmar x is   which translates to  this is a however  the proper spelling is  hamar   indicating the creator was not a fully literate image stones and runestones found in denmark and southern sweden bear an inscription of a hammer  runestones depicting thor s hammer include runestones u 1161  in

included an inscription calling for thor to safeguard the stone  for example  the stone of virring in denmark had the inscription þur uiki þisi kuml  which translates into english as  may thor hallow this memorial   there are several examples of a similar inscription  each one asking for thor to  hallow  or protect the specific artifact  such inscriptions may have been in response to the christians  who would ask for god s protection over their to some scholars  the swastika shape may have been a variant popular in anglo-saxon  england prior to christianization  especially in east anglia and wilson (1894)  points out that while the swastika had been  vulgarly called in scandinavia the hammer of thor   in icelandic  thorshamarmerki  mark of thor s hammer   the symbol properly so called had a y or t practitioners of germanic neopagan faiths wear mjölnir pendants as a symbol of that faith worldwide  renditions of mjölnir are designed  crafted and sold by some germanic neopagan groups and individuals some controversy has occurred concerning the potential recognition of the symbol as a religious symbol by the united states in may 2013  the  hammer of thor  was added to the list of united states department of veterans affairs emblems for headstones and coat of arms of the torsås municipality  sweden  features a depiction of mjölnir the insignia of tórshavn  capital of
