 marine isotope stages  mis   marine oxygen-isotope  stages  or oxygen isotope stages  ois   are alternating warm and cool periods in the earth s paleoclimate  deduced from oxygen isotope data reflecting changes in temperature derived from data from deep sea core samples  working backwards from the present  which is mis 1  in the scale  stages with even numbers have high levels of oxygen-18  and represent cold glacial periods  while the odd-numbered  stages are troughs in the oxygen-18  figures  representing warm interglacial intervals  the data are derived from pollen and foraminifera  plankton  remains in drilled marine sediment cores  sapropels  and other data that reflect historic climate  these are called proxies the mis timescale was developed from the pioneering work of cesare emiliani in the 1950s,  and is now widely used in archaeology and other fields to express dating in the quaternary period  the last 2.6  million years   as well as providing the fullest and best data for that period for paleoclimatology or the study of the early climate of the representing  the standard to which we correlate other quaternary climate emiliani s work in turn depended on harold urey s prediction in a paper of 1947  that the ratio between oxygen-18  and oxygen-16  isotopes in calcite  the main chemical component of the shells and other hard parts of a wide range of marine organisms  should vary depending on the prevailing water temperature in which the calcite was 100  stages have been identified  going currently back some 6  million years  and the scale may in future reach back up to 15  mya  some stages  in particular mis 5,  are divided into sub-stages,  such as  mis 5a",  with 5  a  c  and e being warm and b and d cold  a numeric system for referring to  horizons   events rather than periods  may also be used  with for example mis 5.5  representing the peak point of mis 5e,  and 5.51,  5.52  etc  representing the peaks and troughs of the record at a still more detailed level  for more recent periods  increasingly precise resolution of timing continues to be 1957  emiliani moved to the university of miami to have access to core-drilling  ships and equipment  and began to drill in the caribbean and collect core data  a further important advance came in 1967,  when nicholas shackleton suggested that the fluctuations over time in the marine isotope ratios that had become evident by then were caused not so much by changes in water temperature  as emiliani thought  but mainly by changes in the volume of ice-sheets,  which when they expanded took up the lighter oxygen-16  isotypes in preference to the heavier the cycles in the isotope ratio were found to correspond to terrestrial evidence of glacials and interglacials  a graph of the entire series of stages then revealed unsuspected advances and retreats of ice and also filled in the details of the stadials and interstadials more recent ice core samples of today s glacial ice substantiated the cycles through studies of ancient pollen deposition  currently a number of methods are making additional detail possible  matching the stages to named periods proceeds as new dates are discovered and new regions are explored geologically  the marine isotopic records appear more complete and detailed than any terrestrial equivalents  and have enabled a timeline of glaciation for the plio-pleistocene  to be it is now believed that changes in the size of the major ice sheets such as the historical laurentide ice sheet of north america are the main factor governing variations in the oxygen isotope mis data also matches the astronomical data of milankovitch cycles of orbital forcing or the effects of variations in insolation caused by cyclical slight changes in the tilt of the earth s axis of rotation – the  orbital theory   indeed  that the mis data matched milankovich s theory  which he formed during world war i  so well was a key factor in the theory gaining general acceptance  despite some remaining problems at certain points  notably the so-called  100,000-year  problem  for relatively recent periods data from radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology also support the mis the sediments also acquire depositional remanent magnetization which allows them to be correlated with earth s geomagnetic reversals  for older core samples  individual annual depositions cannot usually be distinguished  and dating is taken from the geomagnetic information in the other information  especially as to the ratios of gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  is provided by analysis of ice cores the specmap project  funded by the us national science foundation  has produced one standard chronology for oxygen isotope records  although there are others  this high resolution chronology was derived from several isotopic records  the composite curve was then smoothed  filtered and tuned to the known cycles of the astronomical variables  the use of a number of isotopic profiles was designed to eliminate  noise  errors  that could have been contained within a single isotopic another large research project funded by the us government in the 1970s  and 1980s  was climate  long range investigation  mapping  and prediction  climap   which to a large degree succeeded in its aim of producing a map of the global climate at the last glacial maximum  some 18,000  years ago  with some of the research also directed at the climate some 120,000  years ago  during the last interglacial  the theoretical advances and greatly improved data available by the 1970s  enabled a  grand synthesis  to be made  best known from the 1976  paper variations in the earth’s orbit  pacemaker of the ice ages  in science   by j d  hays  shackleton and john imbrie  which is still very widely accepted today  and covers the mis timescale and the causal effect of the orbital 2010  the subcommission on quaternary stratigraphy of the international commission on stratigraphy dropped other lists of mis dates and started using the lisiecki   raymo (2005)  lr04  benthic stack  as updated  this was compiled by lorraine lisiecki and maureen following dates of the most recent mis from the lisiecki   raymo (2005)  lr04  benthic stack  the figures  in kya  thousands of years ago   are taken from the list on lorraine lisiecki s -the  list continues to mis 104,  beginning 2.614  million years ago the following are the start dates of the most recent mis  in kya  thousands of years ago   the first figures are derived by aitken   stokes from bassinot et al  (1994),  with the figures in parentheses alternative estimates from martinson et al  for stage 4  and for the others the specmap figures in imbrie et al  (1984).  for stages 1–16  the specmap figures are within 5  kya of the figures given here  all figures up to mis 21  are taken from aitken   stokes  table 1.4,  except for the sub-stages  of mis 5,  which are from wright s table older stages  in mya  millions of years
