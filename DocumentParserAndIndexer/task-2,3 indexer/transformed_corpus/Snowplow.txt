 a snowplow  also snow plow  snowplough or snow plough  is a device intended for mounting on a vehicle  used for removing snow and ice from outdoor surfaces  typically those serving transportation purposes  although this term is often used to refer to vehicles mounting such devices  more accurately they are known as winter service vehicles  especially in areas that regularly receive large amounts of snow every year  or in specific environments such as airfields  in other cases  pickup trucks and front end loaders are outfitted with attachments to fulfill this purpose  some regions that do not frequently see snow may use graders to remove compacted snow and ice off the streets  snowplows can also be mounted on rail cars or locomotives to clear railway tracks a snowplow works by using a blade to push snow to the side to clear it from a surface  modern plows may include technology to make it easier to perform the work and stay on the road  these include global positioning system receivers  head-up  displays and infrared cameras large custom snowplows are commonly used at major airports in north america  these plows have oversized blades and additional equipment like a rotating sweeper broom  sometimes called jetblade  and blowers at the rear of the plow for sidewalks and narrow lanes small tractor plows  tracked or wheeled  are often used within canada and the united states when snowfall accumulates above a certain height  snowplow operators may be seen clearing the main arteries first  designated as snow routes   in some cases for the exclusive use of emergency vehicles underbody scrapers are sometimes mounted on vehicles in residential and urban settings  operating on principles similar to a road grader  but allowing greater weights and speed along with the carriage of a road treatment applicator newer technology has allowed the use of articulated plow systems which can clear multiple divided highway lanes simultaneously  jurisdictions adopting this technology include the provinces of alberta  british columbia  new brunswick  ontario and quebec in along with 16  states indiana  kansas  maine  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  missouri  new york  north dakota  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  utah and wisconsin  in the first snow plows were horse-drawn  wedge-plows  made of wood  with the advent of the automobile  a number of inventors set about to improve existing snow plows  in the us  the "snow-clearer"  is said to have been patented as early as the for railways  the first snow plow ever built specifically for use with motor equipment was in 1913.  it was manufactured by good roads machinery in kennett square  pa  and was designed to meet the exacting requirements outlined by engineers of the new york city street cleaning good roads is therefore unofficially credited as the originator of the modern snow plow  though their horse drawn steel blade road graders were used to clear roads of snow as early as the company s founding in 1878  under their original name american road good roads patented the first four-wheel  grader in 1889  thus making it the first pull grading apparatus patented in the united unlike most early snow plow manufacturers  good roads continues to manufacture snow removal equipment today under the name good roads godwin  now located in dunn  north carolina  in the early 1920s  good roads often advertised in the american city magazine that     three out of every four snow plows in use throughout the whole united states are good roads champions   by the mid-1920s  good roads was manufacturing snow plows of various shapes and sizes for use on a wide variety of motorized equipment  other snow plow manufactures began to follow suit as motorized plows were proven more efficient than other methods of snow removal in 1923,  the brothers hans and even øveraasen of norway constructed an early snowplow for use on cars  this proved to be the start of a tradition in snow-clearing  equipment for roads  and airports  as well as the foundation of the company øveraasen snow removal systems  carl frink of clayton  new york  usa was also an early manufacturer of automobile-mounted  snowplows  his company  frink snowplows  now frink-america,  was founded by some accounts as early as snow plows are produced by numerous companies around the world and available for different kinds of vehicles such as service trucks  pickup trucks  suvs and atvs  they are installed using model specific or universal hardware and mount to the frame of the vehicle to ensure durable connection  there are manual  power and hydraulic operating snow plows  all necessary mounting hardware usually comes in set with a plow  snow plow blades are available in various sizes depending on a vehicle type  service trucks usually use a blade sized 96  in (2.4  m  and more  common blade size for pickup trucks and full size suvs is 78–96  in (2.0–2.4  m   smaller atv snow plow blades are 48–78  in (1.2–2.0  m  wide in many countries  railway locomotives have small snowplows permanently attached to their bogies  which also serve as pilots  with others  the snowplow forms part of the obstacle deflector below the bufferbeam  bolt-on  versions also exist  and these attach to the bufferbeam or front coupler  however  larger snowplows exist  which tend to be conversions rather than purpose-built  vehicles  steam locomotive tenders  large diesel locomotive bogies and various freight vehicles have been used  with the snowplow body mounted on the original frames  they are one-ended,  with conventional coupling equipment on the inner end  in canada purpose built snowplow cars  based on a box car with caboose cab located above and behind the blade  are in use in areas where there is a significant snow fall during winter periods  especially in western canada  newfoundland and northern ontario   these cars were influenced by the russell plow from the united states and used in canada in the most of the russell type plows have been retired for smaller custom built railplow or snow blades attached to hopper cars or locomotives conventional operation may see one or two locomotives running together with a snowplow at either end  this enables a snow clearance train to reverse direction quickly if it gets stuck  alternatively  a single locomotive with bogie plows can act as a self-propelled  snowplow by running light engine via rail has employed the use of snow blade attached to the front of some locomotives to plow as the railcar moves along the track and can handle minimal amounts of on-track  steel and rubber tired "hy-rail"  equipment can also be employed to remove snow from railroad tracks  the pettibone speed swing loader and similar machines  both with and without hyrail wheels can be fitted with a large capacity snow bucket or a wedge plow to clear the tracks  ballast regulators  machines designed to shape the profile of the crushed stone ballast that anchors the track in place  can be used without modification or refitted with purpose built snow blades  blowers and wings to clear snow from the right of way locomotive propelled jordan ditcher spreaders are still sometimes used to plow especially deep snow in the us on the former wisconsin central railroad  these machines carry large main plows and hydraulic or air powered articulating wings to push snow far away from the tracks  sometimes past the next adjacent track to facilitate clearing snow from yards and sidings  these machines can also used to create ditches and plow the tracks clear of loose material during maintenance operations  russell plows are still in service at some locations  with large front wedge plows and shorter hinged air powered wings only suitable for plowing snow
