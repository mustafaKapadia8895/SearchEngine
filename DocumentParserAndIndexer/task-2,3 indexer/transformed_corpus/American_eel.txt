 the american eel  anguilla rostrata  is a facultative catadromous fish found on the eastern coast of north america  eels  anguilla spp   are fish belonging to the elopomorph superorder  a group of phylogenetically ancient the american eel has a slender snakelike body that is covered with a mucous layer  which makes the eel appear to be naked and slimy despite the presence of minute scales  a long dorsal fin runs from the middle of the back and is continuous with a similar ventral fin  pelvic fins are absent  and relatively small pectoral fin can be found near the midline  followed by the head and gill-covers.  variations exist in coloration  from olive green  brown shading to greenish-yellow  and light gray or white on the belly  eels from clear water are often lighter than those from dark  tannic acid eel lives in fresh water and estuaries and only leaves these habitats to enter the atlantic ocean to start its spawning migration to the sargasso spawning takes place far offshore where the eggs hatch  the female can lay up to 4  million buoyant eggs a year  and dies after egg-laying.  after the eggs hatch and the early-stage  larvae develop into leptocephali  the young eels move toward north america where they metamorphose into glass eels and enter freshwater systems where they grow as yellow eels until they begin to mature the american eel is found along the atlantic coast including chesapeake bay and the hudson river and as far north as the st  lawrence river region  it is also present in the river systems of the eastern gulf of mexico and in some areas further south  like all anguillid eels  american eels hunt predominantly at night  and during the day they hide in mud  sand or gravel very close to shore  at depths of roughly 5  to 6  feet  they feed on crustaceans  aquatic insects  small insects  and probably any aquatic organisms that they can find and eat  in the lake ontario system  they have been demonstrating dietary preferences towards the invasive round needed american eels are economically important in various areas along the east coast as bait for fishing for sport fishes such as the striped bass  or as a food fish in some areas  their recruitment stage  the glass eel  are also caught and sold for use in aquaculture  although this is now restricted in most areas eels were once an abundant species in rivers  and were an important fishery for aboriginal people  the construction of hydroelectric dams has blocked their migrations and locally extirpated eels in many watersheds  for example  in canada  the vast numbers of eels in the st  lawrence and ottawa rivers have american eel anguilla rostrata was first described in 1817  by lesueur  anguilla is latin for eel  and rostrata is a latin word that can mean either  beaked or curved  or  long nose   french  anguille d’amérique  spanish  anguila americana american eels can grow to 1.22  m (4.0  ft  in length and to 7.5  kg (17  lb  in weight  females are generally larger than males  lighter in color  with smaller eyes and higher the body is elongate and snake-like.  its dorsal and anal fins are confluent with the rudimentary caudal fin  it lacks ventral fins but pectoral fins are present  the lateral line is well-developed  and complete  the head is long and conical  with rather small  well-developed  eyes  the mouth is terminal with jaws that are not particularly elongated  the teeth are small  pectinate or setiform in several series on the jaws and the vomer  minute teeth also present on the pharyngeal bones  forming a patch on the upper pharyngeals  tongue present with thick lips that are attached by a frenum in front  nostrils are superior and well separated  gill openings are partly below pectoral fins  relatively well-developed  and well separated from one another  inner gill slits are scales are small  rudimentary  cycloid  relatively well embedded below the epidermis and therefore often difficult to see without the scales are not arranged in overlapping rows as they often are in other fish species but are rather irregular  in some places distributed like “parquet flooring”  in general  one row of scales lies at right angle to the next  although the rows immediately above and below the lateral line lie at an angle of approximately 45°.  unlike other bony fishes  the first scales do not develop immediately after the larval stage but appear much later morphological features distinguish the american eel from other eel species  tesch described three morphological characteristics which persist through all stages from larvae to maturing eels  the total number of vertebrae  mean 107.2),  the number of myomeres  mean 108.2),  and the distance between the origin of the dorsal fin to the anus  mean 9.1%  of total length  the distribution of the american eel encompasses all accessible freshwater  streams and lakes   estuaries and coastal marine waters across a latitudinal range of 5  to 62  their natural range includes the eastern north atlantic ocean coastline from venezuela to greenland and including inland  this species extends into the great lakes and the mississippi occurrences of this species in the united states were recorded from lake mead on the colorado river and on the arizona it was stocked on a few occasions in sacramento and san francisco bay  california  in the late 1800s.  no apparent evidence of survival on these occasions was it was also stocked and unintentionally introduced in various states  including illinois  nebraska  north ohio and and wisconsin  stocking of this species also occurred in utah in the late 1800s,  but soon are bottom dwellers  they hide in burrows  tubes  snags  masses of plants  other types of they are found in a variety of habitats including streams  rivers  and muddy or silt-bottomed  lakes during their freshwater stage  as well as oceanic waters  coastal bays and individuals during the continental stage occasionally migrate between fresh  salt and brackish water habitats and have varying degrees of residence time in during winter  eels burrow under the mud and enter a state of torpor  or complete inactivity  at temperatures below 5  although they may occasionally be active during this temperature requirements are suggested to be flexible  it has been found that american eels during elver stage can survive temperature as low as −0.8  °c  barila and stauffer (1980)  reported a final mean temperature preference at 16.7  °c  karlsson et al  (1984)  disagreed with this interpretation and found the final temperature preference of 17.4  ± 2.0  °c with a 95%  confidence interval seasonal patterns described by fletcher and anderson (1972)  generalize annual movements from freshwater to estuaries and coastal bays to feed during spring  then either a return during the fall to overwinter  juvenile and immature adults   or a southward migration to the spawning grounds  silver eels continental phase eels appear highly plastic in habitat use  eels are extremely mobile and may access habitats that appear unavailable to them  using small watercourses or moving through wet grasses  small eels (<100  mm total length  are able to climb and may succeed in passing over vertical habitat availability may be reduced by factors such as habitat deterioration  barriers to upstream migration  larger eels   and barriers  i e  turbines  to downstream migration that can result in american eel’s complex life history begins far offshore in the sargasso sea in a semelparous and panmictic from there  young eels drift with ocean currents and then migrate inland into streams  rivers and lakes  this journey may take many years to complete with some eels travelling as far as 6,000  kilometers  after reaching these freshwater bodies they feed and mature for approximately 10  to 25  years before migrating back to the sargasso sea in order to complete their life stages are detailed eggs  the eggs hatch within a week of deposition in the sargasso sea  mccleave et al  (1987)  suggested that hatching peaks in february and may continue until april  wang and tzeng (2000)  proposed  on the basis of otolith back-calculations,  that hatching occurs from march to october and peaks in august  however  cieri and mccleave (2000)  argued that these back-calculated  spawning dates do not match collection evidence and may be explained by resorption  fecundity for many eels is between about 0.5  to 4.0  million eggs  with larger individuals releasing as many as 8.5  million the diameter of egg is about 1.1  mm  fertilization is external  and adult eels are presumed to die after spawning  none has been reported to migrate up rivers.2.  leptocephali  the leptocephalus is the larval form  a stage strikingly different from the adult form the eels will grow into  leptocephali are transparent with a small pointed head and large teeth and are frequently described “leaf-like”.  the laterally compressed larvae are passively transported west and north to the coastal waters on the eastern coast of north america  by the surface currents of the gulf stream system  a journey that will last between 7  and 12  vertical distribution is usually restricted to the upper 350  m of the ocean  growth has been evaluated at about 0.21  to 0.38  mm per day.3.  glass eel  as they enter the continental shelf  leptocephali metamorphose into glass eels  juveniles   which are transparent and possess the typical elongate and serpentine eel shape  the term glass eel refers to all developmental stages between the end of metamorphosis and full metamorphosis occurs when leptocephali are about 55  to 65  mm long  mean age at this metamorphosis has been evaluated at 200  days and estuarine arrival at 255  days  giving 55  days between glass eel metamorphosis and estuarine arrival  young eels use selective tidal stream transport to move up estuaries  as they enter coastal waters  the animals essentially transform from a pelagic oceanic organism to a benthic continental organism.4.  elvers  glass eels become progressively pigmented as they approach the shore  these eels are termed elvers  the melanic pigmentation process occurs when the young eels are in coastal waters  at this phase of the life cycle  the eel is still sexually undifferentiated  the elver stage lasts about three to twelve months  elvers that enter fresh water may spend much of this period migrating upstream  elver influx is linked to increased temperature and reduced flow early in the migration season  and to tidal cycle influence later yellow eels  this is the sexually immature adult stage of american eel  they begin to develop a yellow color and a creamy or yellowish belly  in this phase  the eels are still mainly nocturnal  those remained in estuarine environment continue to go through their life cycle more quickly than those traveled into freshwater  those in freshwater  however  tend to live longer and attain much larger sizes  sexual differentiation occurs during the yellow stage and appears to be strongly influenced by environmental conditions  krueger and oliveira (1999)  suggested that density was the primary environmental factor influencing the sex ratio of eels in a river  with high densities promoting the production of males  from life history traits of four rivers of maine  oliveira and mccleave (2000)  evaluated that sexual differentiation was completed by 270  mm total length.6.  silver eels  as the maturation process proceeds  the yellow eel metamorphoses into a silver eel  the silvering metamorphosis results in morphological and physiological modifications that prepare the animal to migrate back to the sargasso sea  the eel acquires a greyish colour with a whitish or cream coloration the digestive tract degenerates  the pectoral fins enlarge to improve swimming capacity  eye diameter expands and visual pigments in the retina adapt to the oceanic environment  the integument percentage of somatic lipids increases to supply energy for migrating and spawning  gonadosomatic index and oocyte diameter increase  gonadotropin hormone (gth-ii)  production increases  and osmoregulatory physiology changes eels are nocturnal and most of their feeding therefore occurs at having a keen sense of smell  eels most likely depend on scent to find food  the american eel is a generalist species which colonizes a wide range of habitats  their diet is therefore extremely diverse and includes most of the aquatic animals sharing the same environment little is known about the food habits of leptocephali  recent studies on other eel species  otake et al  1993;  mochioka and iwamizu 1996)  suggest that leptocephali do not feed on zooplankton but rather consume detrital particles such as marine snow and fecal pellets or particles such as discarded houses of larvacean tunicates based on laboratory experiments on european glass eels  lecomte-finiger  (1983)  reported that they were morphologically and physiologically unable to feed  however  tesch (1977)  found that elvers at a later stage of pigmentation  stage via4,  were stomach examination of elvers caught during their upstream migration in the petite trinité river on the north shore of the gulf of st  lawrence revealed that elvers fed primarily on insect larvae the yellow eel is essentially a nocturnal benthic omnivore  prey includes fishes  molluscs  bivalves  crustaceans  insect larvae  surface-dwelling  insects  worms  frogs and plants  the eel prefers small prey animals which can easily be food type varies with body stomachs of eels less than 40  cm and captured in streams contained mainly aquatic insect larvae  whereas larger eels fed predominantly on fishes and crayfishes  insect abundance decreased in larger eels  the eel diet adapts to seasonal changes and the immediate environment  feeding activity decreases or stops during the winter  and food intake ceases as eels physiologically prepare for the spawning information about predation on eels has been published  it was reported that elvers and small yellow eels are prey of largemouth bass and striped bass  although they were not a major parts of these predators  leptocephali  glass eels  elvers  and small yellow eels are likely to be eaten by various predatory fishes  older eels are also known to eat incoming glass they also fall prey to other species of eels  bald eagles  gulls  as well as other fish-eating  major outlet for us landings of yellow and silver eels is the eu the 1970s,  the annual north atlantic harvest averaged 125,418  kg  with an average value of $84,000.  in 1977,  the eel landings from maine  new hampshire  and massachusetts were about 79,700,  2,700,  and 143,300  kg  valued at $263,000,  $5,000,  and $170,000,  respectively  us department of commerce 1984)during  the 1980s  and early 1990s,  the american eel was one of the top three species in commercial value to ontario s fishing industry  at its peak  the eel harvest was valued at $600,000  and  in some years  eel accounted for almost half of the value of the entire commercial fish harvest from lake ontario  the commercial catch of american eel has declined from approximately 223,000  kilograms  kg  in the early 1980s  to 11,000  kg in to the international union for conservation of nature  the american eel is at very high risk of extinction in the decline in numbers and fishery landings of american eels over their range in eastern canada and the us was noted  raising concerns over the status of this species  the number of juvenile eels in the lake ontario area decreased from 935,000  in 1985  to about 8,000  in 1993  and was approaching zero levels in 2001.  rapid declines were also recorded in virginia  as well as in new brunswick and prince edward island in canada because of its complex life cycle  the species face a broad range of threats  some of which are specific to certain growth stage  being catadromous  the eels s reproductivity success depends heavily on free downstream passage for spawning migration  it also depends on the availability of diverse habitats for growth and maturation sex ratio in the population can also be affected because males and females tend to utilize different habitats  impacts on certain regions may greatly impact the number of either sex despite being able to live in a wide range of temperatures and different levels of salinity  american eels are very sensitive to low dissolved oxygen which is typically found below dams  contaminations of heavy metals  dioxins  chlordane  and polychlorinated biphenyls as well as pollutants from nonpoint source can bioaccumulate within the fat tissues of the eels  causing dangerous toxicity and reduced this problem is exacerbated due to the high fat content of eels construction of dams and other irrigation facilities seriously decreases habitat availability and diversity for the eels  dredging can affect migration  population distribution and prey availability  overfishing or excessive harvesting of juveniles can also negatively impact local populations other natural threats come from interspecific competition with exotic species like the flathead catfish  pylodictis olivaris  and blue catfish  ictalurus furcatus   pathogens and parasites  and changes in oceanographic conditions that can alter currents-this  potentially alter larval transport and migration of juveniles back to freshwater streams management of the species had been virtually non-existent  till very recently  information on the species is still limited and much more efforts are needed for a longterm plan to monitor localized populations the u s  fish and wildlife service reviewed the status of the american eel both in 2007  and in 2015,  finding both times that endangered species act protection for the american eel is not the canadian province of ontario has cancelled the commercial fishing quota since 2004.  eel sport fishery has been closed  efforts have been made to improve the passage in which eels migrate across the hydroelectric dams on st  lawrence 2010,  greenpeace international has added the american eel to its seafood red list   the greenpeace international seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world  and which have a very high risk of being sourced
