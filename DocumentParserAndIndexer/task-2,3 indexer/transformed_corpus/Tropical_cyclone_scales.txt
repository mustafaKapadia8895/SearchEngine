 tropical cyclones are officially ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales  according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin s  they are located in  only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones  but some alternative scales also exist  such as accumulated cyclone energy  the power dissipation index  the integrated kinetic energy index  and the hurricane severity index tropical cyclones that develop in the northern hemisphere are officially classified  by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales  tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist  within the north atlantic ocean or the north-eastern  pacific ocean  are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms  should a system intensify further and become a hurricane  then it will be classified on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale  which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute  period  in the western pacific  the typhoon committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin  which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute  period the india meteorological department s scale uses 7  different classifications for systems  within the north indian ocean and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute  maximum sustained winds  tropical cyclones that develop in the southern hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on off two scales  which are both based on 10-minute  sustained wind speeds  the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale which is used to classify systems  within the australian or south pacific tropical cyclone basins  the scale used to classify systems in the south-west  indian ocean and is adapted by meteo france  for use in various french territories  including new caledonia and french polynesia the definition of sustained winds recommended by the world meteorological organization  wmo  and used by most weather agencies is that of a 10-minute  average at a height of 10  m (33  ft   however  the saffir–simpson hurricane scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute  period  at 10  m (33  ft  above the surface  the scale used by rsmc new delhi applies a 3-minute  averaging period  and the australian scale is based on both 3-second  wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute  interval  these make direct comparisons between basins difficult within all basins tropical cyclones are named when the sustained winds hit 35  kn (40  mph  65  km h  tropical cyclones are defined as being warm cored  non-frontal  synoptic cyclones  that develop over tropical or subtropical waters  with organized atmospheric convection and have a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation  they are classified by the wind speeds located around the circulation centre and are ranked  by the world meteorological organisation s regional specialized meteorological centers on one of five tropical cyclone scales  the scale used for a particular tropical cyclone depends on what basin the system is located in  with for example the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale and the australian tropical cyclone intensity scales both used in the western hemisphere  all of the scales rank tropical cyclones using their maximum sustained winds  which are either observed  measured or estimated using various techniques  over a period between one and ten minutes tropical cyclones that occur within the northern hemisphere to the east of the anti-meridian,  are officially monitored by either the national hurricane center or the central pacific hurricane within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a warm cored  non-frontal  synoptic disturbance  that develops over tropical or subtropical waters  with organized atmospheric convection and a closed well defined circulation the region also defines a subtropical cyclone as a non-frontal  low pressure disturbance  that has the characteristics of both tropical and extratropical once either of these classifications are met  then advisories are initiated and the warning centers will classify the system as either a tropical or subtropical depression  if the one-minute  sustained winds estimated or measured as less than 33  kn (38  mph  62  however  if a tropical disturbance is capable of producing tropical storm or hurricane conditions on land within 48  hours  then advisories will be initiated and it will be classified as a potential tropical should the system intensify further or already have one-minute  sustained winds of 34–63  kn (39–73  mph  63–118  km h   then it will be called either a tropical or subtropical storm and assigned a the tropical system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured  as greater than 64  kn (74  mph  119  km h   then it will be called a hurricane and classified on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind the lowest classification on the sshws is a category 1  hurricane  which has winds of between 64–82  kn (74–95  mph  119–153  should the hurricane intensify further then it will be rated as a category 2  hurricane  if it has winds of between 83–95  kn (96–110  mph  154–177  when a system becomes a category 3  hurricane with winds of between 96–112  kn (111–129  mph  178–208  km h   it is considered to be a major hurricane by the warning a category 4  hurricane has winds of 113–136  kn (130–156  mph  209–251  km h   while a category 5  hurricane has winds of at least 137  kn (157  mph  252  a post tropical cyclone is a system that has weakened  into a remnant low or has dissipated and formal advisories are usually discontinued at this however  advisories may continue if the post tropical cyclone  poses a significant threat to life and they may also continue if the remnants of the system have a chance of regeneration and producing tropical storm or hurricane-force  winds over land within 48  sshs was originally created using both wind speed and storm surge  but since the relationship between wind speed and storm surge is not necessarily definite  the scale was changed to the  saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale   sshws   based entirely on wind speed although increasing echelons of the scale correspond to stronger winds  the rankings are not absolute in terms of effects  lower-category  storms can inflict greater damage than higher-category  storms  depending on factors such as local terrain  population density and total rainfall  for instance  a category 2  hurricane that strikes a major urban area will likely do more damage than a large category 5  hurricane that strikes a mostly rural region  in fact  tropical systems of less than hurricane strength can produce significant damage and human casualties  especially from flooding and landslides historically  the term great hurricane was used to describe storms that possessed winds of at least 110  kn (125  mph  200  km h   large radii  over 160  km   100  mi  and that caused large amounts of destruction  this term fell into disuse after the introduction of the saffir–simpson scale in the early minor change to the scale was made ahead of the 2012  hurricane season  with the wind speeds for categories 3–5  tweaked to eliminate the rounding errors  that had occurred during previous seasons when a hurricane had wind speeds of 115  kn (130  mph  215  cyclones that occur within the northern hemisphere between the anti-meridian  and 100°e,  are officially monitored by the japan meteorological agency  jma  rsmc within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a non-frontal  synoptic scale cyclone originating over tropical or sub-tropical  waters  with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind the lowest classification used by the typhoon committee is a tropical depression  which has 10-minute  sustained winds of less than 33  kn (17  m s  38  mph  61  should the tropical depression intensify further it is named and classified as a tropical storm  which has winds speeds between 33–47  kn (17–24  m s  38–54  mph  61–87  should the system continue to intensify further then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm  which has winds speeds between 48–63  kn (25–32  m s  55–72  mph  89–117  the highest classification on the typhoon committee s scale is a typhoon  which has winds speeds greater than 64  kn (33  m s  74  mph  119  china meteorological administration  the hong kong observatory  hko   pagasa and the jma  all divide the typhoon category further for domestic the jma divides the typhoon category into three categories  with a 10-minute  maximum wind speed below 84  kn (43  m s  97  mph  156  km h  assigned for the  strong  typhoon category  a very strong typhoon has wind speeds between 85–104  kn (44–54  m s  98–120  mph  157–193  km h   while a violent typhoon has wind speeds of 105  kn (54  m s  121  mph  194  km h  or the hko and the cma also divide the typhoon category into three categories  with both assigning a maximum wind speed of 80  kn (41  m s  92  mph  150  km h  to the typhoon category  a severe typhoon has wind speeds of 85–104  kn (44–54  m s  98–120  mph  157–193  km h   while a super typhoon has winds of 100  kn (51  m s  120  mph  190  during may 2015  pagasa introduced the term super typhoon and used it for systems with winds greater than 120  kn (62  m s  140  mph  220  addition to the national meteorological services of each nation  the united states joint typhoon warning center monitors the basin  and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones for the united states these warnings use a 1-minute  sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale  however  the jtwc uses their own scale for intensity classifications in this these classifications are tropical depression  tropical storm  typhoon and super in addition  the taiwan central weather bureau has its own scale in chinese but uses the typhoon committee scale in tropical cyclone that develops within the north indian ocean between 100°e  and 45°e  is monitored by the india meteorological department  imd  rsmc new within the region a tropical cyclone is defined as being a non frontal synoptic scale cyclone  that originates over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind the lowest official classification used in the north indian ocean is a depression  which has 3-minute  sustained wind speeds of between 17–27  kn (20–31  mph  31–49  should the depression intensify further then it will become a deep depression  which has winds between 28–33  kn (32–38  mph  50–61  the system will be classified as a cyclonic storm and assigned a name by the imd  if it should develop gale-force  wind speeds of between 34–47  kn (39–54  mph  62–88  severe cyclonic storms have storm force wind speeds of between 48–63  kn (55–72  mph  89–117  km h   while very severe cyclonic storms have hurricane-force  winds of 64–89  kt (73–102  mph  118–166  km h   extremely severe cyclonic storms have hurricane-force  winds of 90–119  kn (166–221  km h  104–137  the highest classification used in the north indian ocean is a super cyclonic storm  which have hurricane-force  winds of above 120  kn (138  mph  222  a system has been classified as a depression if it is an area where the barometric pressure is low compared with its other classifications historically used include  cyclonic storm where the winds did not exceed force 10  on the beaufort scale and a cyclone where the winds are either force 11  and 12  on the beaufort between 1924  and 1988,  tropical cyclones were classified into four categories  depression  deep depression  cyclonic storms and severe cyclonic however  a change was made during 1988  to introduce the category  severe cyclonic storm with core of hurricane winds  for tropical cyclones  with wind speeds of more than 64  kn (74  mph  119  during 1999  the categories very severe cyclonic storm and super cyclonic storm were introduced  while the severe cyclonic storm with a core of hurricane winds category was during 2015  another modification to the intensity scale took place  with the imd calling a system with 3-minute  maximum sustained wind speeds between 90–119  kn (166–221  km h  104–137  mph   an extremely severe cyclonic the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin  and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states these warnings use a 1-minute  sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale  however  regardless of intensity in this basin the jtwc labels all systems as tropical tropical cyclone that develops within the southern hemisphere between africa and 90°e  is monitored by meteo france s la reunion tropical cyclone centre  mfr  rsmc la within the region a tropical disturbance is defined to be a non-frontal  synoptic scale low pressure area  originating over tropical or sub-tropical  waters with organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation with the average wind speed estimated to be not exceeding 27  knots (50  km h   a tropical disturbance is mfr s generic term for a non-frontal  area of low pressure that has organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind the system should be estimated to have wind speeds of less than 28  knots (50  km h  32  system is designated as a tropical depression or a subtropical depression when it reaches wind speeds above 28  knots (50  km h  32  mph   should a tropical depression reach wind speeds of 35  knots (65  km h  40  mph  then it will be classified as a moderate tropical storm and assigned a name by either the sub regional center in mauritius or madagascar  no matter how strong a subtropical system is in this basin  it is always designated as a subtropical the named storm intensify further and reach winds speeds of 48  knots (89  km h  55  mph   then it will be classified as a severe tropical a severe tropical storm is designated as a tropical cyclone when it reaches wind speeds of 64  knots (118  km h  74  should a tropical cyclone intensify further and reach wind speeds of 90  knots (166  km h  103  mph   it will be classified as an intense tropical a very intense tropical cyclone is the highest category on the south-west  indian ocean tropical cyclone scale  and has winds of over 115  knots (212  km h  132  the tenth ra i tropical cyclone committee held during 1991,  it was recommended that the intensity classifications be changed ahead of the 1993–94  tropical cyclone specifically it was decided that the classifications  weak tropical depression  moderate tropical depression and severe tropical depression would be changed to tropical depression  moderate tropical storm and severe tropical this change was implemented ahead of the 1993–94  tropical cyclone the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin  and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states these warnings use a 1-minute  sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale  however  regardless of intensity in this basin the jtwc labels all systems as tropical cyclones that occur within the southern hemisphere to the east of 90°e,  are officially monitored by one or more tropical cyclone warning these are run by the fiji meteorological service  new zealand s metservice  indonesia s badan meteorologi  klimatologi  dan geofisika  papua new guinea s national weather service  while three others are run by the australian bureau of within the region a tropical cyclone is defined as being a non-frontal  low pressure system of synoptic scale that develops over warm waters  with a definite organized wind circulation and 10-minute  sustained wind speeds of 34  kn (63  km h  39  mph  or greater near the once this definition has been met then all of the centres name the system and start to use the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale  which measures tropical cyclones using a five category system based on 10-minute  maximum sustained a category 1  tropical cyclone is estimated to have 10-minute  sustained wind speeds of 34–47  kn (39–54  mph  63–87  km h   while a category 2  tropical cyclone is estimated to have 10-minute  sustained wind speeds of 48–63  kn (55–72  mph  89–117  when a system becomes a category 3  tropical cyclone it is reclassified as a severe tropical cyclone and has wind speeds of 64–85  kn (74–98  mph  119–157  a category 4  severe tropical cyclone has winds of 86–110  kn (99–130  mph  157–200  km h   while the maximum rating is a category 5  severe tropical cyclone  which has winds of at least 110  kn (130  mph  200  systems below tropical cyclone strength there are various terms used  including tropical disturbance  tropical low and tropical a tropical disturbance is defined as being a non – frontal system of synoptic scale originating over the tropics  with persistent enhanced convection and or some indication of a a tropical depression or tropical low is a disturbance with a defined circulation  where the central position can be estimated  and the maximum 10-minute  average wind speed is less than 34  kn (39  mph  63  km h  near the the fms numbers these systems when they have a potential to develop into a tropical cyclone or persist to cause significant impact to life and property  within its area of responsibility and have been analysed for the previous 24  the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale was introduced by the bom  ahead of the 1989–90  cyclone season  the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin  and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states these warnings use a 1-minute  sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale  however  regardless of intensity in these basins the jtwc labels all systems as tropical are other scales that are not officially used by any of the regional specialized meteorological centres or the tropical cyclone warning centres  however they are used by other organizations  such as the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  an example of such scale is the integrated kinetic energy index  which measures the destructive potential of the storm surge  it works on a scale that ranges from one to six  with six having the highest destructive cyclone energy  ace  is used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and other agencies to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone it is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm  wind speed 35  knots or higher  at six-hour  the numbers are usually divided by 10,000  to make them more manageable  the unit of ace is 104  kn2,  and for use as an index the unit is as well as being squared for ace  wind speed can also be cubed  which is referred to as the power dissipation index hurricane severity index  hsi  is another scale used and rates the severity of all types of tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the intensity and the size of their wind the hsi is a 0  to 50  point scale  allotting up to 25  points for a tropical cyclone s intensity and up to 25  points for wind field points are awarded on a sliding scale  with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind terminology for tropical cyclones differs from one region to another  below is a summary of the classifications used by the official warning centres worldwide
