 the cape floristic region is a floristic region located near the southern tip of south africa  it is the only floristic region of the cape  south african  floristic kingdom  and includes only one floristic province  known as the cape floristic province the cape floristic region  the smallest of the six recognised floral kingdoms of the world  is an area of extraordinarily high diversity and endemism  and is home to over 9,000  vascular plant species  of which 69  percent are much of this diversity is associated with the fynbos biome  a mediterranean-type,  fire-prone  the economical worth of fynbos biodiversity  based on harvests of fynbos products  e g  wildflowers  and eco-tourism,  is estimated to be in the region of r77  million a thus  it is clear that the cape floristic region has both economic and intrinsic biological value as a biodiversity to the greatest non-tropical  concentration of higher plant species in the world  the region is the only hotspot that encompasses an entire floral kingdom  and holds five of south africa’s 12  endemic plant families and 160  endemic genera  covering 78,555  km²  cape floristic region hotspot is located entirely within the borders of south africa  it is one of the five temperate mediterranean-type  systems on the hotspots list  and is one of only two hotspots that encompass an entire floral kingdom  the other being new needed   the region covers the mediterranean climate region of south africa in the western cape in the southwestern corner of the country  and extends eastward into the eastern cape  a transitional zone between the winter rainfall region to the west and the summer-rainfall  region to the east in kwazulu-natal.most  of the region is covered with fynbos  a sclerophyllous shrubland occurring on acid sands or nutrient poor soils derived from table mountain sandstones  cape supergroup   fynbos is home to an amazing diversity of plant species including many members of the protea family  proteaceae   heath family  ericaceae   and reed family of restios  restionaceae   other vegetation types are sandveld  a soft coastal scrubland found mostly on the west-facing  coast of the western cape province  on tertiary sands  renosterveld is a grassy shrubland dominated by members of the daisy family  asteraceae – particularly renosterbos  elytropappus rhinocerotis   graminoids and geophytes  occurring on the base-rich  shaley soils of the coastal forelands  small pockets of afromontane forest  southern afrotemperate forest  can be found in humid and sheltered areas according to takhtajan (1978),  the following families are endemic or subendemic to the region  grubbiaceae  roridulaceae  bruniaceae  penaeaceae  greyiaceae  geissolomataceae  retziaceae  retzia  and world wildlife fund divides the cape floristic region into three ecoregions  the lowland fynbos and renosterveld  montane fynbos and renosterveld and the albany thickets the fynbos ecoregions are designated one of the global 200  priority ecoregions for conservation  conservation international declared the cape floristic region to be a biodiversity hotspot it is thought that the cape floristic region is experiencing one of the most rapid rates of extinction in the world due to habitat loss  land degradation  and invasive alien 2004,  the  cape floral region protected areas  were inscribed as a world heritage site  the site includes eight representative protected areas this article incorporates cc by-3.0  text from the
