 cape bojador  arabic  رأس بوجادور‎‎  trans  rā s būjādūr  berber  ⴱⵓⵊⴷⵓⵔ  bujdur  spanish and portuguese  cabo bojador  french  cap boujdour  is a headland on the northern coast of western sahara  at 26°  07'  37"n,  14°  29'  57"w   various sources give various locations  this is from the sailing directions for the region   as well as the name of the large nearby town with a population of the name of the surrounding province also derives its name from the cape  bojador province  it is shown on nautical charts with the original portuguese name  cabo bojador   but is sometimes spelled  cape boujdour  in some media and academic it is said that it is also known as the  bulging cape   although no references to this usage are to be found in standard geographical references  the cape s name in arabic is  abu khatar   meaning  the father of cape is not prominent on maps but may be located by looking 220  km (120  nautical miles  due south of the south-western  point of the hook of fuerteventura  canary islands the discovery of a passable route around cape bojador  in 1434,  by the portuguese mariner gil eanes was considered a major breakthrough for european explorers and traders en route to africa and later to needed  eanes had made a previous attempt in 1433  which resulted in failure  but tried again under orders of prince henry the navigator  who first sent him in 1424.  he was successful after the second expedition  the disappearance of numerous european vessels that had made prior attempts to round the cape despite its violent seas  led some to suggest the presence of sea monsters  the mythic importance of the cape for portugal was captured in fernando pessoa s early 20th  century work  mensagem   in famous stanzas from this longer poem pessoa wrote of the enormous costs of the portuguese explorations to the nation  capturing the symbolic importance to the nation of rounding cape bojador  pessoa wrote   who wants to pass beyond bojador   must also pass beyond pain     quem quer passar além do bojador   tem que passar além da dor    they thought the ocean was burning past cape bojador  but henry s men went past it the reason for the fearsome reputation of the cape is not immediately obvious from maps  where it appears as the south-western  point of a slight hump in the coastline  bounded at its other end by cabo falso bojador  ten nautical miles to the northeast  nor does what is said in the sailing directions sound terribly formidable   cabo falso bojador is formed by several tall sand dunes     a rocky shoal  with a least depth of 4.8m,  extends up to 3  miles n of the cape  a rocky patch  with a least depth of 8m,  lies about 2  miles w of the cape  the coast between cabo falso bojador and cabo bojador  10  miles sw  consists of a sandy beach fringed by rocks  clumps of scrub top the sand dunes which stand about 0.5  mile inland of this beach  heavy breakers have been observed along this coast at all times  cabo bojador  a very low point  is located 9.5  miles sw of cabo falso bojador and is bordered on the s side by black rocks  from the n  the cape appears as a mass of red sand with a gradual slope towards the sea  from the w  the cape is difficult to identify  but from the s its extremity appears as a reef which dries in places and is marked by breakers even in calm weather  examining the pilot charts for this area  however  it becomes clear that the main concern lies in the changes in winds that occur at about the point at which cape bojador is passed in sailing down the coast  it is here that the winds start to blow strongly from the northeast at all seasons  together with the half-knot  set of current down the coast  these conditions would naturally alarm an ignorant and superstitious medieval mariner used to sailing close to the land and having no knowledge of what lay ahead  in the end it was discovered that by sailing well out to sea—far out of sight of land—a more favorable wind could be picked up in addition  this is also believed to be the site where captain james riley and the crew of the u s  brig commerce  sailing at the time from gibraltar towards the cape verde islands  shipwrecked in august 1815.  this tragedy is recounted in the skeletons on the zahara  by dean king  which is set in this region of the african coast  dean reports that any coastal map of western sahara is inaccurate because of the ever-changing  physical features  due to the harsh conditions of the sahara  it also mentions that the depth of the water surrounding cape bojador is deceptively shallow  and the color of the sand underneath the water is a  fearful sight   the cape had a fearsome reputation among mariners even prior to the wreck of the commerce  as there had been at least thirty known shipwrecks between 1790  and fears were founded in what they saw  and the phenomena witnessed by the sailors of those days can be seen today  any ship that has to pass those places makes sure to give a wide berth in order to avoid accidents  cape bojador and its surrounding coast extends into the sea in the form of an underwater reef  and  when the waves break after crashing into unseen gullies  the water spouts furiously into high foamy clouds that look like steam  even on calm days  the sea next to the cape  and for approximately 3  miles seaward from the coast  is no more than two metres deep  fish are abundant in the area  and shoals of sardines rise to the surface during the feeding times of larger fish  when this happens  the sea seems to bubble violently as if boiling  and  observed from a distance  the hissing sound produced by the fish flicking their tails on the water s surface adds to the impression  the stifling air wafted westerly on lazy breezes from the desert heightens the impression of extreme temperature  while the desert dust helps to create a mysterious darkness  worse  the ferrous rocks make compass needles whirl erratically  as recently as 2004,  the british royal navy s publication africa pilot warns that nautical charts of the coastline in the area of cape bojador are  reported to be spanish interest in the desert coast of western africa was the result of fishing activities carried out from the canary islands by spanish fishermen spanish fishers were seal fur traders and hunters  fishers and whalers off the sahara coast with several enclaves in cabo bojador  dakhla and ras nouadhibou from 1500  to present  extending from the west coast of africa to hunting humpback whales and whale calves  mostly in cape verde  and the gulf of guinea in annobon  são tomé and príncipe islands just to 1940.  these fishing activities have had a negative impact on wildlife causing the disappearance or endangerment of many species  particularly marine mammals and birds  the former range of the mediterranean monk seal  monachus monachus  extended throughout the northwest atlantic coast of africa and the mediterranean and black sea coastlines  including all offshore islands of the mediterranean  and into the atlantic and its islands  canary islands  madeira  ilhas desertas  porto santo  and others as far west as the azores  vagrants could be found as far south as gambia and the cape verde islands  and as far north as continental portugal and atlantic spanish originally claimed the land from 20°  51'  n  near cap blanc  to 26°  8'  n  near cape bojador  in 1885.  this would be a protectorate governed from the canary islands in 1887.  france would later claim the western sahara  the boundary was settled in a joint french-spanish  convention in 1900  to divide the area between spanish sahara and french west claimed a protectorate over the coastal region from cap blanc  far to the south of cape bojador  to a point about 200  km to the north in 1884.  in 1975,  as spain pulled out following the madrid accords  morocco sought to gain control over the area  leading to disputes between morocco and the polisario front  the organization which proclaimed the sahrawi arab democratic republic in february 1976.  in january 2016  it was announced that the canary association of victims of terrorism  acavite  intended to sue the polisario front for committing  crimes against the tindouf region of algeria  daira de bojador is a refugee camp for sahrawis named after cape bojador in december 2015,  the bodies of 11  drowned migrants were found 147  kilometers off cape bojador  earlier that same month  the spanish coastguard rescued 47  african migrants in a boat of the coast of
