 the blue whiting  micromesistius poutassou  one of the two species in the genus micromesistius in the cod family  is common in the northeast atlantic ocean from morocco to iceland and spitsbergen  it also occurs in the northern parts of the mediterranean  where it may be locally blue whiting also occur in the northwest atlantic ocean between canada and greenland  but is considered rare  it has a long  narrow body and a silvery underbody  the fish can attain a length of more than 40  cm  the average length of blue whiting caught off the west shores of the uk is 31  related species  southern blue whiting  micromesistius australis  occurs in the southern hemisphere exploitation of blue whiting only started in the 1970s.  the species  in the last decades  has become increasingly important to the fishing industries of northern european countries  including russia  catches exceeded 1  million tonnes from 1998  to according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations  blue whiting was fifth most important capture fish species in however  recruitment of the stock fell to a low level in 2006  and has been weak ever since  causing declining spawning stock and eventually triggering strong reductions in catch quotas  the reasons for low recruitment in recent years are poorly the total quota for 2011  was set to 40,100  which is less than 2%  of the record catch of 2.4  million tonnes in 2004.  catches in 2011  exceeded the quota by more than 2012,  ices advises the catches should be no more than 391,000  this large increase relative to the quota in 2011   but not to the catches in 1998-2008)  is caused by a revision in the stock assessment  however  recruitment to the stock is still low and the stock is forecasted to decline  the coastal states set the total quota for 2012  to 391,000  fish is usually not marketed fresh  but processed into fish meal and oil  however  in russia and in southern europe  blue whiting are sometimes sold as food fish blue whiting in the northeast atlantic is a straddling stock  it occupies the exclusive economic zone  eez  of the faroe islands  the european union  iceland and norway  as well as the high this means effective regulation calls for international co-operation.quota  advice for blue whiting in the northeast atlantic is provided by ices  for a long period  blue whiting fisheries were mainly regulated through nationally set quotas because there was no international agreement about sharing the total consequently  the total catch greatly exceeded the advised however  the coastal states  the faroe islands  the european union  iceland and norway  reached an agreement in december ending the period of what was sometimes referred to as  olympic fishing   since 2006,  the blue whiting fishery has been regulated under this agreement  which gives the greatest share to the european union  but through quota swaps  norway has been holding the largest annual quotas
