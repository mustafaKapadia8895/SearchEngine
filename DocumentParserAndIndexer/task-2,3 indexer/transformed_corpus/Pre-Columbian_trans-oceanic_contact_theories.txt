 claims of pre-columbian  trans-oceanic  contact relate to visits to  the discovery of or interaction with the americas and or indigenous peoples of the americas by people from africa  asia  europe  or oceania before columbus s first voyage to the caribbean in such contact is generally accepted in prehistory  but has been hotly debated in the historic historical cases of pre-columbian  contact are accepted amongst the scientific and scholarly mainstream  successful explorations led to norse settlement of greenland and the l anse aux meadows settlement in some 500  years before columbus the scientific and scholarly responses to other post-prehistory,  pre-columbian  contact claims have varied  some such contact claims are examined in reputable peer-reviewed  sources  other contact claims  typically based on circumstantial and ambiguous interpretations of archaeological finds  cultural comparisons  comments in historical documents  and narrative accounts  have been dismissed as fringe science or is now generally believed that earlier  prehistoric peopling of the americas was achieved by boat at least 14,000  years ago  replacing the once dominant theory of ice-free  corridor migration associated with the clovis the world s largest general scientific society  the american association for the advancement of science  aaas   for science in august 2017:most  archaeologists think the first americans arrived by boat  now  they’re beginning to prove it  whereas archaeologists once thought that the earliest arrivals wandered into the continent through a gap in the ice age glaciers covering canada  most researchers today think the first inhabitants came by sea  in this view  maritime explorers voyaged by boat out of beringia—the ancient land now partially submerged under the waters of the bering strait—about 16,000  years ago and quickly moved down the pacific coast  reaching chile by at least 14,500  years ago key evidence norse journeys to greenland and canada are supported by historical and archaeological evidence  a norse colony in greenland was established in the late 10th  century  and lasted until the mid 15th  century  with court and parliament assemblies  þing  taking place at brattahlíð and a bishop at the remains of a norse settlement at l anse aux meadows in newfoundland  canada  were discovered in 1960  and are dated to around the year

also notable for its possible connection with the attempted colony of vinland established by leif erikson around the same period or  more broadly  with norse exploration of the sources describing contact between indigenous peoples and norse people exist  contact between the thule people  ancestors of the modern inuit  and norse between the 12th  or 13th  centuries is known  the norse greenlanders called these incoming settlers  skrælingar   conflict between the greenlanders and the  skrælings  is recorded in the icelandic annals  the term skrælings is also used in the vínland sagas  which relate to events during the 10th  century  when describing trade and conflict with native sweet potato  which is native to the americas  was widespread in polynesia when europeans first reached the pacific  sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated  in the cook islands to 1000  ce  and current thinking is that it was brought to central polynesia c  700  ce and spread across polynesia from it has been that it was brought by polynesians who had traveled to south america and back  or that south americans brought it to the pacific  it is possible that the plant could successfully float across the ocean if discarded from the cargo of a phylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis of at least two separate introductions of sweet potatoes from south america into polynesia  including one before and one after european  see also  linguistics  a team of academics headed by the university of york s mummy research group and while examining a peruvian mummy at the bolton museum  found that it had been embalmed using a tree resin  before this it was thought that peruvian mummies were naturally preserved  the resin  found to be that of an araucaria conifer related to the  monkey puzzle tree   was from a variety found only in oceania and probably new guinea   radiocarbon dating of both the resin and body by the university of oxford s radiocarbon laboratory confirmed they were essentially contemporary  and date to around ce including kathryn klar and terry jones have proposed a theory of contact between hawaiians and the chumash people of southern california between 400  and 800  ce  the sewn-plank  canoes crafted by the chumash and neighboring tongva are unique among the indigenous peoples of north america  but similar in design to larger canoes used by polynesians for deep-sea  voyages  tomolo o  the chumash word for such a craft  may derive from kumula au  the hawaiian term for the logs from which shipwrights carve planks to be sewn into the analogous tongva term  tii at  is unrelated  if it occurred  this contact left no genetic legacy in california or hawaii  this theory has attracted limited media attention within california  but most archaeologists of the tongva and chumash cultures reject it on the grounds that the independent development of the sewn-plank  canoe over several centuries is well-represented  in the material existence of chicken bones dating from 1321  to 1407  in chile and thought to be genetically linked to south pacific island chicken species suggested further evidence of south pacific contact with south america  the genetic link between the south american mapuche  to whom the chickens were thought to originally chicken bones and south pacific island species has been rejected by a more recent genetic study which concluded that  the analysis of ancient and modern specimens reveals a unique polynesian genetic signature  and that  a previously reported connection between pre-european  south america and polynesian chickens most likely resulted from contamination with modern dna  and that this issue is likely to confound ancient dna studies involving haplogroup e chicken recent years  evidence has emerged suggesting a possibility of pre-columbian  contact between the mapuche people  araucanians  of south-central  chile and polynesians  chicken bones found at the site el arenal in the arauco peninsula  an area inhabited by mapuche  support a pre-columbian  introduction of chicken to south the bones found in chile were radiocarbon-dated  to between 1304  and 1424,  before the arrival of the spanish  chicken dna sequences taken were matched to those of chickens in american samoa and tonga  and dissimilar to european however  a later report in the same journal looking at the same mtdna concluded that the chilean chicken specimen clusters with the same european indian subcontinental southeast asian sequences  providing no support for a polynesian introduction of chickens to south linguists and specialists in amerindian languages willem adelaar and pieter muysken have suggested that two lexical items may be shared by polynesian languages and languages of south america  one is the name of the sweet potato  which was domesticated in the new world  proto-polynesian   compare easter island kumara  hawaiian ʻuala  māori kumāra  apparent cognates outside eastern polynesian may be borrowed from eastern polynesian languages  calling proto-polynesian  status and age into question  may be connected with quechua and aymara k’umar   k’umara  a possible second is the word for  stone axe   easter island toki  new zealand maori toki  adze   mapuche toki  and further afield  yurumanguí totoki  axe   according to adelaar and muysken  the similarity in the word for sweet potato  constitutes near proof of incidental contact between inhabitants of the andean region and the south pacific   though according to adelaar and muysken the word for axe is not as convincing  the authors argue that the presence of the word for sweet potato suggests sporadic contact between polynesia and south america  but no december 2007,  several human skulls were found in a museum in concepción  chile  these skulls originated from mocha island  an island just off the coast of chile in the pacific ocean  formerly inhabited by the mapuche  craniometric analysis of the skulls  according to lisa matisoo-smith  of the university of otago and josé miguel ramírez aliaga of the universidad de valparaíso  suggests that the skulls have  polynesian features  – such as a pentagonal shape when viewed from behind  and rocker 2007  to 2009,  geneticist erik thorsby and colleagues have published two studies in tissue antigens that evidence an amerindian genetic contribution to the easter island population  determining that it was probably introduced before european discovery of the 2014,  geneticist anna-sapfo  malaspinas of the center for geogenetics at the university of copenhagen published a study in current biology that found human genetic evidence of contact between the populations of easter island and south america  approximately 600  years ago  i e  1400  ce ± 100  members of the now extinct botocudo people  who lived in the interior of brazil  were found in research published in 2013,  to have been members of mtdna haplogroup b4a1a1,  which is normally found only among polynesians and other subgroups of austronesians  this was based on an analysis of a 14  skulls  two belonged to b4a1a1   while twelve belonged to subclades of mtdna haplogroup c1  common among native americans   the research team examined various scenarios  none of which they could say for certain were correct  they dismissed a scenario of direct contact in prehistory between polynesia and brazil as  too unlikely to be seriously entertained   while b4a1a1  is also found among the malagasy people of madagascar  which experienced significant austronesian settlement in prehistory   the authors described as  fanciful  suggestions that b4a1a1  among the botocudo resulted from the african slave trade  which included has been confirmed that  some amazonian native americans descend partly from a     founding population that carried ancestry more closely related to indigenous australians  new guineans and andaman islanders than to any present-day  eurasians or native americans   according to a genetic study published in nature in july the authors  who included david reich  added   this signature is not present to the same extent  or at all  in present-day  northern and central americans or in a ~12,600-year-old  clovis-associated  genome  suggesting a more diverse set of founding populations of the americas than previously accepted   this appears to conflict with an article published roughly simultaneously in science which adopts the previous consensus perspective   the ancestors of all native americans entered the americas as a single migration wave from siberia no earlier than ~23  ka  separate from the inuit and diversified into  northern  and  southern  native american branches ~13  ka  there is evidence of post-divergence  gene flow between some native americans and groups related to east asians inuit and australo-melanesians  2013  genetic study suggests the possibility of contact between ecuador and east asia  the study suggests that the contact could have been trans-oceanic  or a late-stage  coastal migration that did not leave genetic imprints in north this contact could explain the alleged similarity between the pottery of the valdivia culture of ecuador and the jōmon culture of northeast researchers have argued that the olmec civilization came into existence with the help of chinese refugees  particularly at the end of the shang in 1975,  betty meggers of the smithsonian institution argued that the olmec civilization originated due to shang chinese influences around 1200  in a 1996  book  mike xu  with the aid of chen hanping  claimed that celts from la venta bear chinese these claims are unsupported by mainstream mesoamerican needed other claims have been made for early chinese contact with north america in 1882  artifacts identified at the time as chinese coins were discovered in british columbia  a contemporary account states the summer of 1882  a miner found on de foe  deorse   creek  cassiar district  br  columbia  thirty chinese coins in the auriferous sand  twenty-five  feet below the surface  they appeared to have been strung  but on taking them up the miner let them drop apart  the earth above and around them was as compact as any in the neighborhood  one of these coins i examined at the store of chu chong in victoria  neither in metal nor markings did it resemble the modern coins  but in its figures looked more like an aztec calendar  so far as i can make out the markings  this is a chinese chronological cycle of sixty years  invented by emperor huungti  2637  bce  and circulated in this form to make his people remember it in 1885,  a vase containing similar discs was also discovered  wrapped in the roots of a tree around 300  years grant keddie  curator of archeology at the royal bc museum  examined a photograph of a coin from cassiar taken in the 1940s   whereabouts now unknown  and he believes that the character style and the evidence that it was machine-ground  show it to be a 19th-century  copy of a ming dynasty temple group of chinese buddhist missionaries led by hui shen before 500  ce claimed to have visited a location called fusang  although chinese mapmakers placed this territory on the asian coast  others have suggested as early as the that fusang might have been in north america  due to perceived similarities between portions of the california coast and fusang as depicted by asian his book 1421:  the year china discovered the world  the british author gavin menzies made the controversial claim that the fleet of zheng he arrived in america in professional historians contend that zheng he reached the eastern coast of africa  and dismiss menzies s hypothesis as entirely without 1973  and 1975  doughnut-shaped  stones were discovered off the coast of california that resembled stone anchors used by chinese fishermen  these  sometimes called the palos verdes stones  were initially thought to be up to 1500  years old and proof of pre-columbian  contact by chinese sailors  later geological investigations showed them to be a local rock known as monterey shale  and they are thought to have been used by chinese settlers fishing off the coast in the nineteenth june 2016,  purdue university published the results of research on six metal and composite metal artifacts excavated from a late prehistoric archaeological context at cape espenberg on the northern coast of the seward peninsula in alaska  also part of the research team was robert j  speakman  of the center for applied isotope studies at the university of georgia  and victor mair  of east asian languages and civilizations at the university of pennsylvania  the report is the first evidence that metal from asia reached prehistoric north america before the contact with europeans  stating that x-ray  fluorescence identified two of these artifacts as smelted industrial alloys with large proportions of tin and lead  the presence of smelted alloys in a prehistoric inuit context in northwest alaska was demonstrated for the first time and indicates the movement of eurasian metal across the bering strait into north america before sustained contact with europeans this is not a surprise based on oral history and other archaeological finds  and it was just a matter of time before we had a good example of eurasian metal that had been traded we believe these smelted alloys were made somewhere in eurasia and traded to siberia and then traded across the bering strait to ancestral inuits people  also known as thule culture  in alaska  locally available metal in parts of the arctic  such as native metal  copper and meteoritic and telluric iron were used by ancient inuit people for tools and to sometimes indicate status  two of the cape espenberg items that were found – a bead and a buckle — are heavily leaded bronze artifacts  both are from a house at the site dating to the late prehistoric period  around 1100-1300  ad  which is before sustained european contact in the late 18th  century  the belt buckle also is considered an industrial product and is an unprecedented find for this time  it resembles a buckle used as part of a horse harness that would have been used in north-central  china during the first six centuries before the common era smithsonian archaeologist betty meggers wrote that pottery associated with the valdivia culture of coastal ecuador dated to 3000–1500  bce exhibited similarities to pottery produced during the jōmon period in japan  arguing that contact between the two cultures might explain the similarities  chronological and other problems have led most archaeologists to dismiss this idea as the suggestion has been made that the resemblances  which are not complete  are simply due to the limited number of designs possible when incising clay alaskan anthropologist nancy yaw davis claims that the zuni people of new mexico exhibit linguistic and cultural similarities to the the zuni language is a linguistic isolate  and davis contends that the culture appears to differ from that of the surrounding natives in terms of blood type  endemic disease  and religion  davis speculates that buddhist priests or restless peasants from japan may have crossed the pacific in the 13th  century  traveled to the american southwest  and influenced zuni the 1890s,  lawyer and politician james argued that pre-columbian  contact between japanese sailors and native americans was highly probable  given that from the early 17th  century to the mid-19th  century several dozen japanese ships were carried from asia to north america along the powerful kuroshio currents  such japanese ships landed from the aleutian islands in the north to mexico in the south  carrying a total of 293  persons in the 23  cases where head-counts  were given in historical records  in most cases  the japanese sailors gradually made their way home on merchant vessels  but in 1833  one japanese crew crashed near cape flattery and was enslaved by makahs for a period before being rescued by members of the hudson s bay company  another japanese ship crashed in about 1850  near the mouth of the columbia river  wickersham writes  and the sailors were assimilated into the local native american population  while admitting there was no definitive proof of pre-columbian  contact between japanese and north americans  wickersham thought it implausible that such contacts as outlined above would have started only after europeans arrived in north america in 1879,  alexander cunningham described the carvings on the stupa of bharhut from c  200  bce and described some fruit like detail as a custard-apple   annona he wasn t aware that botanists believed this plant to be indigenous only in the americas  but others quickly pointed out the difficulty  as it was generally believed that the custard-apple  had not been brought to india before vasco da gama s discovery of the sea route in 1498.  this suggestion was generally disregarded but a 2009  study claimed to have found carbonized remains that date to 2000  bce and appear like seeds of custard elliot smith claimed that certain details in the mayan stelae at copán represented an asian elephant  he wrote elephants and ethnologists  a book on the topic in 1924.  contemporary archaeologists suggested that it was based on a tapir and his suggestions have generally been dismissed by subsequent carving details from around the 12th  century in karnataka that appeared like ears of maize  zea mays   a crop from the new world  were interpreted by carl johannessen in 1989  as evidence of pre-columbian  these suggestions were dismissed by multiple indian researchers based on several lines of evidence  the object has been claimed by some to represent a muktaphala  an imaginary fruit bedecked with claims for an african presence in mesoamerica stem from attributes of the olmec culture  the presence of an african plant species in the americas  and interpretations of certain european and arabic historical accounts the olmec culture existed from roughly 1200  bce to 400  bce  the idea that the olmecs are related to africans was suggested by josé melgar  who discovered the first colossal head at hueyapan  now tres zapotes  in more recently  ivan van sertima has argued that these statues depict settlers or explorers from africa  but his views have been the target of severe scholarly african sources describe what some consider to be visits to the new world by a mali fleet in according to these sources  400  ships from the mali empire discovered a land across the ocean to the west after being swept off course by ocean currents  only one ship returned  and the captain reported the discovery of a western current to prince abubakari ii  the off-course  mali fleet of 400  ships is said to have conducted both trade and warfare with the peoples of the western lands  it is claimed that abubakari ii abdicated his throne and set off to explore these western lands  in 1324,  the mali king mansa musa is said to have told the arabic historian al-umari  that  his predecessors had launched two expeditions from west africa to discover the limits of the atlantic ocean  according to the abstract of columbus s log made by bartolomé de las casas  the purpose of columbus’s third voyage was to test both the claims of king john ii of portugal that  canoes had been found which set out from the coast of guinea africa  and sailed to the west with merchandise  as well as the claims of the native inhabitants of the caribbean island of hispaniola that  from the south and the southeast had come black people whose spears were made of a metal called guanín   from which it was found that of 32  parts  18  were gold  6  were silver  and 8  researcher niede guidon  who led the pedra furada sites excavations      said she believed that humans … might have come not overland from asia but by boat from chinese accounts of muslim expeditions state that muslim sailors reached a region called mulan pi   magnolia skin    chinese  木蘭皮  pinyin  mùlán pí  wade–giles  mu-lan-p'i).  mulan pi is mentioned in lingwai daida

hold that it is instead some part of the supporter of the interpretation of mulan pi as part of the americas was historian hui-lin  li in and while joseph needham was also open to the possibility  he doubted that arab ships at the time would have been able to withstand a return journey over such a long distance across the atlantic ocean and points out that a return journey would have been impossible without knowledge of prevailing winds and to muslim historian abu al-hasan   alī al-mas'ūdī  (871-957),  khashkhash ibn saeed ibn aswad  arabic  خشخاش بن سعيد بن اسود‎‎  sailed over the

putative carthaginian coins in north america are based on modern replicas  that may have been buried at sites from massachusetts to nebraska in order to confuse and mislead archaeological solutrean hypothesis argues that europeans may have immigrated to the new world during the paleolithic era  circa 16,000  to 13,000  bce  this hypothesis proposes contact partly on the basis of perceived similarities between the flint tools of the solutrean culture in modern-day  france  spain and portugal  which thrived circa 20,000  to 15,000  bce   and the clovis culture of north america  which developed circa 9000  the solutrean hypothesis  first proposed in the mid-1990s,  has had little support amongst the scientific and subsequent genetic research has been cited as further weakening support for the of contacts with the civilizations of classical antiquity—primarily with the roman empire  but sometimes also with other cultures of the age—have been based on isolated archaeological finds in american sites that originated in the old world  the bay of jars in brazil has been yielding ancient clay storage jars that resemble roman for over 150  years  it has been proposed that the origin of these jars is a roman wreck  although it has been suggested that they could be 15th  or 16th  century spanish olive oil jars romeo hristov argues that a roman ship  or the drifting of such a shipwreck to the american shores  is a possible explanation of archaeological finds  like the tecaxic-calixtlahuaca  bearded head  from ancient rome in america  hristov claims that the possibility of such an event has been made more likely by the discovery of evidences of travels from romans to tenerife and lanzarote in the canaries  and of a roman settlement  from the 1st  century bce to the 4th  century ce  on lanzarote small terracotta head sculpture  with a beard and european-like  features  was found in 1933   in the toluca valley  72  kilometres southwest of mexico city  in a burial offering under three intact floors of a pre-colonial  building dated to between 1476  and 1510.  the artifact has been studied by roman art authority bernard andreae  director emeritus of the german institute of archaeology in rome  italy  and austrian anthropologist robert von heine-geldern,  both of whom stated that the style of the artifact was compatible with small roman sculptures of the 2nd  if genuine and if not placed there after 1492   the pottery found with it dates to between 1476  and the find provides evidence for at least a one-time  contact between the old and new to asu s michael e  john paddock  a leading mesoamerican scholar  used to tell his classes in the years before he died that the artifact was planted as a joke by hugo moedano  a student who originally worked on the site  despite speaking with individuals who knew the original discoverer  garcía payón   and moedano  smith says he has been unable to confirm or reject this claim  though he remains skeptical  smith concedes he cannot rule out the possibility that the head was a genuinely buried post-classic  offering at i sinclair  earl of orkney and feudal baron of roslin  c  1345  – c  1400)  was a scottish nobleman  he is best known today because of a modern legend that he took part in explorations of greenland and north america almost 100  years before christopher in 1784,  he was identified by johann reinhold as possibly being the prince zichmni described in letters allegedly written around the year 1400  by the zeno brothers of venice  in which they describe a voyage throughout the north atlantic under the command of was the grandfather of william sinclair  1st  earl of caithness  the builder of rosslyn chapel  near edinburgh  scotland   the authors robert lomas and christopher knight believe some carvings in the chapel to be ears of new world corn or this crop was unknown in europe at the time of the chapel s construction  and was not cultivated there until several hundred years later  knight and lomas view these carvings as evidence supporting the idea that henry sinclair travelled to the americas well before columbus  in their book they discuss meeting with the wife of the botanist adrian dyer  and that dyer s wife told him that dyer agreed that the image thought to be maize was in fact dyer found only one identifiable plant among the botanical carvings and suggested that the  maize  and  aloe  were stylized wooden patterns  only coincidentally looking like real specialists in medieval architecture interpret these carvings as stylised depictions of wheat  strawberries or have conjectured that columbus was able to persuade the catholic monarchs of castile and aragon to support his planned voyage only because they were aware of some recent earlier voyage across the atlantic  some suggest that columbus himself visited canada or greenland before 1492,  because according to bartolomé de las casas he wrote he had sailed 100  leagues past an island he called thule in 1477.  whether he actually did this and what island he visited  if any  is uncertain  columbus is thought to have visited bristol in bristol was also the port from which john cabot sailed in 1497,  crewed mostly by bristol sailors  in a letter of late 1497  or early 1498  the english merchant john day wrote to columbus about cabot s discoveries  saying that land found by cabot was  discovered in the past by the men from bristol who found  brasil  as your lordship there may be records of expeditions from bristol to find the  isle of brazil  in 1480  and trade between bristol and iceland is well documented from the mid 15th  century gonzalo fernández de oviedo y valdés records several such legends in his general y natural historia de las indias of 1526,  which includes biographical information on columbus  he discusses the then-current  story of a spanish caravel that was swept off its course while on its way to england  and wound up in a foreign land populated by naked tribesmen  the crew gathered supplies and made its way back to europe  but the trip took several months and the captain and most of the men died before reaching land  the ship s pilot  a man called alonso sánchez  and very few others finally made it to portugal  but all were very ill  columbus was a good friend of the pilot  and took him to be treated in his own house  and the pilot described the land they had seen and marked it on a map before dying  people in oviedo s time knew this story in several versions  but oviedo regarded it as 1925,  soren larsen wrote a book claiming that a joint danish-portuguese  expedition landed in newfoundland or labrador in 1473  and again in 1476.  larsen claimed that didrik pining and hans pothorst served as captains  while joão vaz corte-real  and the possibly mythical john scolvus served as navigators  accompanied by álvaro nothing beyond circumstantial evidence has been found to support larsen s legend of saint brendan  an irish monk  involves a fantastical journey into the atlantic ocean in search of paradise in the 6th  century  since the discovery of the new world  various authors have tried to link the brendan legend with an early discovery of america  in 1977  the voyage was successfully recreated by tim severin using an ancient irish to a british myth  madoc was a prince from wales who explored the americas as early as 1170.  while most scholars consider this legend to be untrue  it was used as justification for british claims to the americas  based on the notion of a briton arriving before other european and controversial amateur epigrapher barry fell claims that irish ogham writing has been found carved into stones in the linguist david h  kelley has criticized some of fell s work but nonetheless argued that genuine celtic ogham inscriptions have in fact been discovered in however  others have raised serious doubts about these of contact have often been based on occurrences of similar motifs in art and decoration  or on depictions in one world of species or objects that are thought to be characteristic of the other world  famous examples include a maya statuette claimed to depict a bearded man rowing  a cross in bas-relief  at the temple of the cross in nevertheless  most of these finds can be explained as the result of misinterpretation  the palenque  cross   for instance  is almost certainly a stylized maize plant in 1950,  an italian botanist  domenico casella  suggested that a depiction of a pineapple was represented among wall paintings of mediterranean fruits at pompeii  according to wilhelmina feemster jashemski  this interpretation has been challenged by other botanists  who identify it as a pine cone from the umbrella pine tree  which is native to the mediterranean bat creek inscription and los lunas decalogue stone have led some to suggest the possibility that jewish seafarers may have come to america after fleeing the roman empire at the time of the jewish book of mormon  a text of the mormon religion that was allegedly translated by founder joseph smith  jr from ancient gold plates in the early 1800s,  states that some ancient inhabitants of the new world are descendants of semitic peoples who sailed from the old world  mormon apologetics groups such as the foundation for ancient research and mormon studies attempt to study and expand on these ideas  however  archaeologists reject these claims  the national geographic society  in a 1998  letter to the institute for religious research  stated  archaeologists and other scholars have long probed the hemisphere s past and the society does not know of anything found so far that has substantiated the book of some lds scholars share this view  for example literature professor and active mormon terryl givens has pointed out that there is a lack of historical accuracy in the book of mormon as it relates to modern archaeological the 1950s,  m  wells jakeman popularized a belief that the izapa stela 5  represented the tree of life vision from the book of mormon and he claimed it as a validation of the historicity of the claims of pre-columbian  settlement in the his interpretations of the carving and its connection to pre-columbian  contact are not accepted as the central image of the stela actually shows a mesoamerican world tree  connecting the sky above and the water or underworld below  critics have criticized jakeman s interpretation as belying  an obvious religious agenda that ignored izapa stela 5's  of coca and nicotine found in some egyptian mummies have led to speculation that ancient egyptians may have traveled to the new world  the initial discovery was made by a german toxicologist  svetlana balabanova  after examining the mummy of a priestess called henut taui  follow-up  tests of the hair shaft  performed to rule out contamination  gave the same television show reported that examination of numerous sudanese mummies undertaken by balabanova mirrored what was found in the mummy of henut balabanova suggested that the tobacco may be accounted for since it may have also been known in china and europe  as indicated by analysis run on human remains from those respective regions  balabanova proposed that such plants native to the general area may have developed independently  but have since gone other explanations include fraud  though curator alfred grimm of the egyptian museum in munich disputes skeptical of balabanova s findings  rosalie david  keeper of egyptology at the manchester museum  had similar tests performed on samples taken from the manchester mummy collection and reported that two of the tissue samples and one hair sample did test positive for sources of nicotine other than tobacco and sources of cocaine in the old world are discussed by the british biologist duncan scholars remain skeptical  and they do not see this as proof of ancient contact between africa and the americas  especially because there may be possible old world two attempts to replicate balabanova s finds of cocaine failed  suggesting  that either balabanova and her associates are misinterpreting their results or that the samples of mummies tested by them have been mysteriously exposed to re-examination  in the 1970s  of the mummy of ramesses ii revealed the presence of fragments of tobacco leaves in its abdomen  this became a popular topic in fringe literature and the media and was seen as proof of contact between ancient egypt and the new world  the investigator  maurice bucaille  noted that when the mummy was unwrapped in 1886  the abdomen was left open and that  it was no longer possible to attach any importance to the presence inside the abdominal cavity of whatever material was found there  since the material could have come from the surrounding following the renewed discussion of tobacco sparked by balabanova s research and its mention in a 2000  publication by rosalie david  a study in the journal antiquity suggested that reports of both tobacco and cocaine in mummies  ignored their post-excavation  histories  and pointed out that the mummy of ramesses ii had been moved five times between 1883  and 2010  sigríður sunna ebenesersdóttir published a genetic study showing that over 350  living icelanders carried mitochondrial dna of a new type that is similar to the type found only in native american and east asian populations  using the decode genetics database  sigríður sunna determined that the dna entered the icelandic population not later than 1700,  and likely several centuries earlier  however sigríður sunna also states that     while a native american origin seems most likely for new haplogroup   an asian or european origin cannot be ruled 1009,  legends report that norse explorer thorfinn karlsefni abducted two children from markland  an area on the north american mainland where norse explorers visited but did not settle  the two children were then taken to greenland  where they were baptized and taught to speak 1420,  danish geographer claudius clavus swart wrote that he personally had seen  pygmies  from greenland who were caught by norsemen in a small skin boat  their boat was hung in nidaros cathedral in trondheim along with another  longer boat also taken from  pygmies   clavus swart s description fits the inuit and two of their types of boats  the kayak and the similarly  the swedish clergyman olaus magnus wrote in 1505  that he saw in oslo cathedral two leather boats taken decades earlier  according to olaus  the boats were captured from greenland pirates by one of the haakons  which would place the event in the 14th  ferdinand columbus s biography of his father christopher  he says that in 1477  his father saw in galway  ireland two dead bodies which had washed ashore in their boat  the bodies and boat were of exotic appearance  and have been suggested to have been inuit who had drifted off has been suggested that the norse took other indigenous peoples to europe as slaves over the following centuries  because they are known to have taken scottish and irish is also evidence of inuit coming to europe under their own power or as captives after 1492.  a substantial body of greenland inuit folklore first collected in the 19th  century told of journeys by boat to akilineq  here depicted as a rich country across the contact between alaska and kamchatka via the subarctic aleutian islands would have been conceivable  but the two settlement waves on this archipelago started on the american side and its western continuation  the commander islands  remained uninhabited until after russian explorers encountered the aleut people in 1741.  there is no genetic or linguistic evidence for earlier contact along this
