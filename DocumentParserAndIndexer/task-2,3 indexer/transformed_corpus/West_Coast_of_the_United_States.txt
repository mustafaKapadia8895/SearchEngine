 the west coast or pacific coast is the coastline along which the contiguous western united states meets the north pacific ocean  as a region  this term most often refers to the coastal states of california  oregon and washington  more specifically  it refers to an area defined on the east by the cascade range  sierra nevada and mojave desert  and on the west by the pacific ocean  the u s  census groups the five states of california  oregon  washington  alaska  and hawaii together as the pacific states of the 2010  census  the estimated population of the census bureau s pacific region was approximately 47.8  million (56.9  million if nevada and arizona are included  – about 15.3%  (18.2%  with nevada and arizona  of us the largest city on the west coast of the united states is los angeles major cities and metropolitan areas on the west coast include  from north to south  however  of these aforementioned cities and metropolitan areas  only los angeles long beach  san francisco and san diego are directly on the open pacific ocean the history of the west coast begins with the arrival of the earliest known humans of the americas  paleo-indians,  crossing the bering strait from eurasia into north america over a land bridge  beringia  that existed between 45,000  bce and 12,000  bce (47,000–14,000  years ago   small isolated groups of hunter-gatherers  migrated alongside herds of large herbivores far into alaska  between 16,500  bce and 13,500  bce (18,500–15,500  years ago   ice-free  corridors developed along the pacific coast and valleys of north america and possibly by natives  indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast  and california indigenous peoples eventually descended from the paleo-indians.  they developed various languages and established trade needed later  spanish  british  french  russian  and american explorers and settlers began colonizing the needed the west coast of the united states has an oceanic climate in its northern edge towards the canada–us border  but from the california border towards the mexico–us border the climate is mediterranean  the coastline sees significantly mild temperatures when compared to the inland areas during summer  in far northern california there is a difference of 17  °c (30  °f  between eureka and willow creek in spite of only 25  miles (40  km  separating the locations and willow creek being located at a 500  metres (1,600  ft  elevation  slightly narrower fluctuations can be seen all through the coastline  and could partially be explained by the cold currents in the pacific ocean moderating coastal temperatures and the mountain ranges blocking the maritime air from moving farther inland than its foothills during summer  coastal fog is also prevalent in keeping shoreline temperatures cool  this does not only occur in the san francisco bay area  but it also affects santa monica in los angeles  southern california  with very little yearly temperature differences but with cool summers similar to those expected in northern europe  a short journey inland and summer temperatures are compatible with the rest of the united states on the same latitudes  sometimes warmer due to prevailing winds from the nevada and arizona hot desert climate since the west coast has been populated by immigrants more recently than the east coast  its culture is considerably younger  additionally  its demographic composition underlies its cultural difference from the rest of the united states  california s history first as a major spanish colony  and later mexican territory  has given the lower west coast a distinctive hispanic tone  which it also shares with the rest of the southwest  similarly  two of the three cities in which asian americans have concentrated  san francisco and los are located on the west coast  with significant populations in other west coast cities  san francisco s chinatown  the oldest in north america  is a vibrant cultural needed  the west coast also has a proportionally large share of green cities within the united states  which manifests itself in different cultural practices such as bicycling and organic the other hand  the french writer guillaume faye  comparing california to europe  wrote that  as super-america,  california stands out as the absolute antithesis of authentic california has set itself up as the world centre of the simulacrum and the inauthentic  as the absolute synthesis of  cool  stalinism  an hysterical land  focus and meeting-place  for the rootless  california is the land of non-history,  of the non-event,  but at the same time the site of the constant swirl  the uninterrupted rhythm of fashion  that is to say  the site of tremors going nowhere  those tremors which so obsess it  constantly threatened as it is by other writers  like jean baudrillard  mike davis  and umberto eco  have made related statements on californian the northwest  portland and seattle are both considered among the coffee capitals of the while starbucks originated in seattle  both towns are known for small-scale  coffee roasters and independent coffeeshops  in the pacific northwest at large  which includes the canadian west coast  the culture has been significantly shaped by the environment  especially by its forests  mountains  and rain  this may account for the fact that the northwest has many high-quality  libraries and bookshops  most notably powell s books and the seattle central library  and a  bibliophile the region also has a marginal  but growing independence movement based on bioregionalism and a cascadian the cascadian flag has become a popular image at seattle sounders and portland timbers games coordinates  39°n  122°w﻿    ﻿39°n  122°w﻿    39;  -122
