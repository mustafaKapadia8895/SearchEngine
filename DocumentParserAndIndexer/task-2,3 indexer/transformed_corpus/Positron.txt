electric charge of +1  e  a spin of 1/2   same as electron   and has the same mass as an electron  when a positron collides with an electron  annihilation occurs  if this collision occurs at low energies  it results in the production of two or more gamma ray photons  see electron–positron annihilation  positrons may be generated by positron emission radioactive decay  through weak interactions   or by pair production from a sufficiently energetic photon which is interacting with an atom in a material in 1928,  paul dirac published a proposing that electrons can have both a positive and negative charge  this paper introduced the dirac equation  a unification of quantum mechanics  special relativity  and the then-new  concept of electron spin to explain the zeeman effect  the paper did not explicitly predict a new particle but did allow for electrons having either positive or negative energy as solutions  hermann weyl then published a paper discussing the mathematical implications of the negative energy the positive-energy  solution explained experimental results  but dirac was puzzled by the equally valid negative-energy  solution that the mathematical model allowed  quantum mechanics did not allow the negative energy solution to simply be ignored  as classical mechanics often did in such equations  the dual solution implied the possibility of an electron spontaneously jumping between positive and negative energy states  however  no such transition had yet been observed experimentally  he referred to the issues raised by this conflict between theory and observation as  difficulties  that were  unresolved  dirac wrote a follow-up  paper in december that attempted to explain the unavoidable negative-energy  solution for the relativistic electron  he argued that      an electron with negative energy moves in an external field as though it carries a positive charge   he further asserted that all of space could be regarded as a  sea  of negative energy states that were filled  so as to prevent electrons jumping between positive energy states  negative electric charge  and negative energy states  positive charge   the paper also explored the possibility of the proton being an island in this sea  and that it might actually be a negative-energy  electron  dirac acknowledged that the proton having a much greater mass than the electron was a problem  but expressed  hope  that a future theory would resolve the issue robert oppenheimer argued strongly against the proton being the negative-energy  electron solution to dirac s equation  he asserted that if it were  the hydrogen atom would rapidly persuaded by oppenheimer s argument  dirac published a paper in 1931  that predicted the existence of an as-yet-unobserved  particle that he called an "anti-electron"  that would have the same mass as an electron and that would mutually annihilate upon contact with an and earlier stueckelberg  proposed an interpretation of the positron as an electron moving backward in reinterpreting the negative-energy  solutions of the dirac equation  electrons moving backward in time would have a positive electric charge  wheeler invoked this concept to explain the identical properties shared by all electrons  suggesting that  they are all the same electron  with a complex  self-intersecting  yoichiro nambu later applied it to all production and annihilation of particle-antiparticle  pairs  stating that  the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation  but only a change of direction of moving particles  from the past to the future  or from the future to the the backwards in time point of view is nowadays accepted as completely equivalent to other pictures  but it does not have anything to do with the macroscopic terms  cause  and  effect   which do not appear in a microscopic physical description dmitri skobeltsyn first observed the positron in while using a wilson cloud to try to detect gamma radiation in cosmic rays  skobeltsyn detected particles that acted like electrons but curved in the opposite direction in an applied magnetic field likewise  in 1929  chung-yao  chao  a graduate student at caltech  noticed some anomalous results that indicated particles behaving like electrons  but with a positive charge  though the results were inconclusive and the phenomenon was not david anderson discovered the positron on august 2,  for which he won the nobel prize for physics in anderson did not coin the term positron  but allowed it at the suggestion of the physical review journal editor to which he submitted his discovery paper in late 1932.  the positron was the first evidence of antimatter and was discovered when anderson allowed cosmic rays to pass through a cloud chamber and a lead plate  a magnet surrounded this apparatus  causing particles to bend in different directions based on their electric charge  the ion trail left by each positron appeared on the photographic plate with a curvature matching the mass-to-charge  ratio of an electron  but in a direction that showed its charge was wrote in retrospect that the positron could have been discovered earlier based on chung-yao  chao s work  if only it had been followed up frédéric and irène joliot-curie  in paris had evidence of positrons in old photographs when anderson s results came out  but they had dismissed them as positron had also been contemporaneously discovered by patrick blackett and giuseppe occhialini at the cavendish laboratory in 1932.  blackett and occhialini had delayed publication to obtain more solid evidence  so anderson was able to publish the discovery are produced naturally in β  decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes  for example  potassium-40)  and in interactions of gamma quanta  emitted by radioactive nuclei  with matter  antineutrinos are another kind of antiparticle produced by natural radioactivity  β− decay   many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by  and contained in  cosmic rays  recent  as of january 2011)  research by the american astronomical society has discovered antimatter  positrons  originating above thunderstorm clouds  positrons are produced in gamma-ray  flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the antiprotons have also been found to exist in the van allen belts around the earth by the pamela of which the most common are positrons due to their low mass  are also produced in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature  mean particle energy greater than the pair production threshold   during the period of baryogenesis  when the universe was extremely hot and dense  matter and antimatter were continually produced and annihilated  the presence of remaining matter  and absence of detectable remaining also called baryon asymmetry  is attributed to cp-violation:  a violation of the cp-symmetry  relating matter to antimatter  the exact mechanism of this violation during baryogenesis remains a needed positron production from radioactive β  decay can be considered both artificial and natural production  as the generation of the radioisotope can be natural or artificial  perhaps the best known naturally-occurring  radioisotope which produces positrons is potassium-40,  a long-lived  isotope of potassium which occurs as a primordial isotope of potassium  even though a small percent of potassium (0.0117%)  it is the single most abundant radioisotope in the human body  in a human body of 70  kg mass  about 4,400  nuclei of 40k  decay per the activity of natural potassium is 31  about 0.001%  of these 40k  decays produce about 4000  natural positrons per day in the human these positrons soon find an electron  undergo annihilation  and produce pairs of 511  kev gamma rays  in a process similar  but much lower intensity  to that which happens during a pet scan nuclear medicine needed recent observations indicate black holes and neutron stars produce vast amounts of positron-electron  plasma via the jets  large clouds of positron-electron  plasma have also been associated with neutron experiments have found evidence of positrons  as well as a few antiprotons  in primary cosmic rays  amounting to less than 1%  of the particles in primary cosmic rays  these do not appear to be the products of large amounts of antimatter from the big bang  or indeed complex antimatter in the universe  evidence for which is lacking  see below   rather  the antimatter in cosmic rays appear to consist of only these two elementary particles  probably made in energetic processes long after the big needed preliminary results from the presently operating alpha magnetic spectrometer (ams-02)  on board the international space station show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality  and with energies that range from 10  gev to 250  gev  in september  2014,  new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at cern and published in physical review a new measurement of positron fraction up to 500  gev was reported  showing that positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about 16%  of total electron positron events  around an energy of 275  ± 32  gev  at higher energies  up to 500  gev  the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again  the absolute flux of positrons also begins to fall before 500  gev  but peaks at energies far higher than electron energies  which peak about 10  these results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive dark matter like anti-protons,  do not appear to originate from any hypothetical  antimatter  regions of the universe  on the contrary  there is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei  such as antihelium nuclei  i e   anti-alpha  particles   in cosmic rays  these are actively being searched for  a prototype of the ams-02  designated ams-01,  was flown into space aboard the space shuttle discovery on sts-91  in june 1998.  by not detecting any antihelium at all  the ams-01  established an upper limit of 1.1×10−6  for the antihelium to helium flux at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california have used a short  ultra-intense  laser to irradiate a millimeter-thick  gold target and produce more than 100  billion presently significant lab production of 5  mev positron-electron  beams allows investigation of multiple characteristics such as how different elements react to 5  mev positron interactions or impacts  how energy is transferred to particles  and the shock effect of kinds of particle accelerator experiments involve colliding positrons and electrons at relativistic speeds  the high impact energy and the mutual annihilation of these matter antimatter opposites create a fountain of diverse subatomic particles  physicists study the results of these collisions to test theoretical predictions and to search for new kinds of particles gamma rays  emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting  radionuclide  tracer   are detected in positron emission tomography  pet  scanners used in
