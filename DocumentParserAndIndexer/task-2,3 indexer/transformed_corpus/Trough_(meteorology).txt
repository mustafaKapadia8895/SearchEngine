 a trough is an elongated  extended  region of relatively low atmospheric pressure  often associated with fronts  there is not a universal symbol for a trough on a weather chart  the weather charts in some countries or regions mark troughs by a line  in the united states  a trough may be marked as a dashed line  in the uk  hong and it is represented by a bold line extended from a low pressure or between two low pressure in and it is a dashed line  if they are not marked  troughs may still be identified as an extension of isobars away from a low pressure center sometimes the region between two high pressure centers may assume the character of a trough when there is a detectable wind shift noted at the surface  in the absence of a wind shift  the region is designated a col  akin to a geographic saddle between two mountain peaks if a trough forms in the mid-latitudes,  a temperature difference between two sides of the trough usually exists in the form of a weather front  a weather front is usually less convective than a trough in the tropics or subtropics  such as a tropical wave   sometimes collapsed frontal systems will degenerate into troughs convective cells may develop in the vicinity of troughs and give birth to a tropical cyclone  some tropical or subtropical regions such as the philippines or south china are greatly affected by convection cells along a trough  in the mid-latitude  westerlies  troughs and ridges often alternate  especially when upper-level  winds are in a high-amplitude  pattern  for a trough in the westerlies  the region just west of the trough axis is typically an area of convergent winds and descending air -  and hence high pressure -  while the region just east of the trough axis is an area of fast  divergent winds and low pressure  tropical waves are a type of trough in easterly currents  a cyclonic northward deflection of the trade winds troughs may be at the surface  or aloft  or both under various conditions  most troughs bring clouds  showers  and a wind shift  particularly following the passage of the trough  this results from convergence or  squeezing  which forces lifting of moist air behind the trough line in addition to standard troughs  some may be described further with a qualifying term indicating a specific or a set of characteristics an inverted trough is an atmospheric trough which is oriented opposite to most troughs of the mid-latitudes.  most  but not all  inverted troughs are tropical waves  also commonly called easterly waves  most troughs of low pressure in the mid-latitudes  of the northern hemisphere are characterized by decreasing atmospheric pressure from south to north while inverted troughs are characterized by decreasing pressure from north to south  the situation is opposite in the southern hemisphere  inverted troughs in both hemispheres move to the west from the east  while mid-latitude  troughs generally move with the westerlies toward the east a lee trough  also known as a dynamic trough  is  a pressure trough formed on the lee side of a mountain range in situations where the wind is blowing with a substantial component across the mountain ridge  often seen on united states weather maps east of the rocky mountains  and sometimes east of the appalachians  where it is less it can be formed either as a result of the adiabatic compression of sinking air on the lee side of a mountain range  or through cyclogenesis resulting from  the horizontal convergence associated with vertical stretching of air columns passing over the ridge and descending the lee
