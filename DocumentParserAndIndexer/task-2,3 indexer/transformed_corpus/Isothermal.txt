 an isothermal process is a change of a system  in which the temperature remains constant  δt   0.  this typically occurs when a system is in contact with an outside thermal reservoir  heat bath   and the change will occur slowly enough to allow the system to continually adjust to the temperature of the reservoir through heat exchange  in contrast  an adiabatic process is where a system exchanges no heat with its surroundings  q   0).  in other words  in an isothermal process  the value δt   0  and therefore δu   0   only for an ideal gas  but q ≠ 0,  while in an adiabatic process  δt ≠ 0  but q   0.isothermal  processes can occur in any kind of system that has some means of regulating the temperature  including highly structured machines  and even living cells  some parts of the cycles of some heat engines are carried out isothermally  for example  in the carnot in the thermodynamic analysis of chemical reactions  it is usual to first analyze what happens under isothermal conditions and then consider the effect of phase changes  such as melting or evaporation  are also isothermal processes when  as is usually the case  they occur at constant isothermal processes are often used and a starting point in analyzing more complex  non-isothermal  processes isothermal processes are of special interest for ideal gases  this is a consequence of joule s second law which states that the internal energy of a fixed amount of an ideal gas depends only on its thus  in an isothermal process the internal energy of an ideal gas is constant  this is a result of the fact that in an ideal gas there are no intermolecular note that this is true only for ideal gases  the internal energy depends on pressure as well as on temperature for liquids  solids  and real the isothermal compression of a gas there is work done on the system to decrease the volume and increase the doing work on the gas increases the internal energy and will tend to increase the temperature  to maintain the constant temperature energy must leave the system as heat and enter the environment  if the gas is ideal  the amount of energy entering the environment is equal to the work done on the gas  because internal energy does not change  for details of the calculations  see calculation of work for an adiabatic process  in which no heat flows into or out of the gas because its container is well insulated  q   0.  if there is also no work done  i e  a free expansion  there is no change in internal energy  for an ideal gas  this means that the process is also thus  specifying that a process is isothermal is not sufficient to specify a unique process for the special case of a gas to which boyle s applies  the product pv is a constant if the gas is kept at isothermal conditions  the value of the constant is nrt  where n is the number of moles of gas present and r is the ideal gas constant  in other words  the ideal gas law pv   nrt this means thatholds  the family of curves generated by this equation is shown in the graph in figure 1.  each curve is called an isotherm  such graphs are termed indicator diagrams and were first used by james watt and others to monitor the efficiency of engines  the temperature corresponding to each curve in the figure increases from the lower left to the upper right in thermodynamics  the reversible work involved when a gas changes from state a to state b an isothermal  reversible process  this integral equals the area under the relevant pressure-volume  isotherm  and is indicated in purple in figure 2  for an ideal gas  again  p   nrt v applies and with t being constant  as this is an isothermal process   the expression for work becomes by convention  work is defined as the work on the system by its surroundings  if  for example  the system is compressed  then the work is positive and the internal energy of the system increases  conversely  if the system expands  it does work on the surroundings and the internal energy of the system decreases it is also worth noting that for ideal gases  if the temperature is held constant  the internal energy of the system also is constant  and so δu   0.  since the first law of thermodynamics states that δu   q   w  iupac convention   it follows that q   −w for the isothermal compression or expansion of ideal gases isothermal processes are especially convenient for calculating changes in entropy since  in this case  the formula for the entropy change  δs  is simplywhere qrev is the heat transferred reversibly to the system and t is absolute this formula is valid only for a hypothetical reversible process  that is  a process in which equilibrium is maintained at all times a simple example is an equilibrium phase transition  such as melting or evaporation  taking place at constant temperature and pressure  for a phase transition at constant pressure  the heat transferred to the system is equal to the enthalpy of transformation  δhtr  thus q   at any given pressure  there will be a transition temperature  ttr  for which the two phases are in equilibrium  for example  the normal boiling point for vaporization of a liquid at one atmosphere pressure   if the transition takes place under such equilibrium conditions  the formula above may be used to directly calculate the entropy example is the reversible isothermal expansion  or compression  of an ideal gas from an initial volume va and pressure pa to a final volume vb and pressure pb  as shown in calculation of work  the heat transferred to the gas isthis result is for a reversible process  so it may be substituted in the formula for the entropy change to an ideal gas obey s boyle s law  this can be rewritten  if desired  asonce obtained  these formulas can be applied to an irreversible process  such as the free expansion of an ideal gas  such an expansion is also isothermal and may have the same initial and final states as in the reversible expansion  since entropy is a state function  the change in entropy of the system is the same as in the reversible process and is given by the formulas above  note that the result q   0  for the free expansion can not be used in the formula for the entropy change since the process is not reversible the difference between the reversible and free expansions is found in the entropy of the surroundings  in both cases  the surroundings are at a constant temperature  t  so that δssur   −q t  the minus sign is used since the heat transferred to the surroundings is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the heat  q  transferred to the system  in the reversible case  the change in entropy of the surroundings is equal and opposite to the change in the system  so the change in entropy of the universe is zero  in the free expansion  q   0,  so the entropy of the surroundings does not change and the change in entropy of the universe is equal to δs for the system the adjective  isothermal  is derived from the greek words ἴσος  isos  meaning  equal   and θέρμη  therme  meaning  heat
