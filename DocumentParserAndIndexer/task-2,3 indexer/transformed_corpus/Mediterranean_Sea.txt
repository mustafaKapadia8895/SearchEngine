 the mediterranean sea is a sea connected to the atlantic ocean  surrounded by the mediterranean basin and almost completely enclosed by land  on the north by southern europe and anatolia  on the south by north africa  and on the east by the levant  although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the atlantic ocean  it is usually identified as a separate body of water  geological evidence indicates that around 5.9  million years ago  the mediterranean was cut off from the atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000  years before being refilled by the zanclean flood about 5.3  million years ago the name mediterranean is derived from the latin mediterraneus  meaning  inland  or  in the middle of land   from medius   middle  and terra   land    it covers an approximate area of 2.5  million km2  (965,000  sq mi   but its connection to the atlantic  the strait of gibraltar  is only 14  km (8.7  mi  wide  the strait of gibraltar is a narrow strait that connects the atlantic ocean to the mediterranean sea and separates gibraltar and spain in europe from morocco in africa  in oceanography  it is sometimes called the eurafrican mediterranean sea or the european mediterranean sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas mediterranean sea has an average depth of 1,500  m (4,900  ft  and the deepest recorded point is 5,267  m (17,280  ft  in the calypso deep in the ionian sea  the sea is bordered on the north by europe  the east by asia  and in the south by africa  it is located between latitudes 30°  and 46°  n and longitudes 6°  w and 36°  e  its west-east  length  from the strait of gibraltar to the gulf of iskenderun  on the southwestern coast of turkey  is approximately 4,000  km (2,500  miles   the sea s average north-south  length  from croatia’s southern shore to libya  is approximately 800  km (500  miles   the mediterranean sea  including the sea of marmara  connected by the dardanelles to the aegean sea   has a surface area of approximately 2,510,000  square km (970,000  square sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times that allowed for trade and cultural exchange between emergent peoples of the region  the history of the mediterranean region is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies the countries with coastlines on the mediterranean sea are albania  algeria  bosnia and herzegovina  croatia  cyprus  egypt  france  greece  israel  italy  lebanon  libya  malta  morocco  monaco  montenegro  slovenia  spain  syria  tunisia and turkey  in addition  the gaza strip and the british overseas territories of gibraltar and akrotiri and dhekelia have coastlines on the sea the term mediterranean derives from the latin word mediterraneus  meaning  amid the earth  note  earth in the sense  soil   not planet earth   or  between land  (medi-;  adj  medius  -um  -a   middle  between    terra f    land  earth    as it is between the continents of africa  asia and europe  the ancient greek name mesogeios  μεσόγειος   is similarly from μέσο   between    γη   land  it can be compared with the ancient greek name mesopotamia  μεσοποταμία   meaning  between rivers  the mediterranean sea has historically had several names  for example  the carthaginians called it the  syrian sea  and latter romans commonly called it mare nostrum   our sea    and occasionally mare and in greek as the  mare magnum   meaning  great ancient syrian texts  phoenician epics and in the hebrew bible  it was primarily known as the  great sea   הַיָּם הַגָּדוֹל  hayam hagadol  numbers 34:6,7;  joshua 1:4,  9:1,  15:47;  ezekiel 47:10,15,20),  or simply  the sea  (1  kings 5:9;  comp  1  macc  14:34,  15:11);  however  it has also been called the  hinder sea   הַיָּם הָאַחֲרוֹן   due to its location on the west coast of greater syria or the holy land  and therefore behind a person facing the east  sometimes translated as  western sea    deut  11:24;  joel 2:20).  another name was the  sea of the philistines   יָם פְּלִשְׁתִּים  exod  23:31),  from the people inhabiting a large portion of its shores near the israelites in modern hebrew  it has been called hayam hatikhon  הַיָּם הַתִּיכוֹן    the middle sea   reflecting the sea s name in ancient greek  mesogeios   latin mare internum  inner sea  or mare nostrum  our sea   and modern languages in both europe and the middle east  mediterranean  in modern arabic  it is known as al-baḥr  al-mutawassiṭ   البحر المتوسط    the middle sea   while in islamic and older arabic literature  it was referenced as baḥr al-rūm   بحر الروم   or  the roman byzantine ottoman turkish  it has also been called bahr-i  sefid  meaning the  pure white sea  in turkish  it is known as meaning  the white sea   to distinguish it from the black ancient civilisations were located around the mediterranean shores  and were greatly influenced by their proximity to the sea  it provided routes for trade  colonisation  and war  as well as food  from fishing and the gathering of other seafood  for numerous communities throughout the to the shared climate  geology  and access to the sea  cultures centered on the mediterranean tended to have some extent of intertwined culture and history two of the most notable mediterranean civilisations in classical antiquity were the greek city states and the phoenicians  both of which extensively colonised the coastlines of the mediterranean  later  when augustus founded the roman empire  the romans referred to the mediterranean as mare nostrum   our sea   darius i of persia  who conquered ancient egypt  built a canal linking the mediterranean to the red sea  darius s canal was wide enough for two triremes to pass each other with oars extended  and required four days to western roman empire collapsed around ad 476.  temporarily the east was again dominant as roman power lived on in the byzantine empire formed in the 4th  century from the eastern half of the roman empire  another power arose in the 7th  century  and with it the religion of islam  which soon swept across from the east  at its greatest extent  the arab empire controlled 75%  of the mediterranean region and left a lasting footprint on its eastern and southern shores europe started to revive  however  as more organised and centralised states began to form in the later middle ages after the renaissance of the 12th  century ottoman power based in anatolia continued to grow  and in 1453  extinguished the byzantine empire with the conquest of constantinople  ottomans gained control of much of the sea in the 16th  century and maintained naval bases in southern france  algeria and tunisia  barbarossa  the famous ottoman captain is a symbol of this domination with the victory of the battle of preveza (1538).  the battle of djerba (1560)  marked the apex of ottoman naval domination in the mediterranean  as the naval prowess of the european powers increased  they confronted ottoman expansion in the region when the battle of lepanto (1571)  checked the power of the ottoman navy  this was the last naval battle to be fought primarily between galleys the barbary pirates of north africa preyed on christian shipping and coastlines in the western mediterranean according to robert davis  from the 16th  to 19th  centuries  pirates captured 1  million to 1.25  million europeans as development of oceanic shipping began to affect the entire mediterranean  once  most trade between western europe and the east had passed through the region  but after the 1490s  the development of a sea route to the indian ocean allowed the importation of a sian spices and other goods through the atlantic ports of western 2013  the maltese president described the mediterranean sea as a  cemetery  due to the large amounts of migrants who drowned there after their boats european parliament president martin schulz said in 2014  that europe s migration policy  turned the mediterranean into a graveyard   referring to the number of drowned refugees in the region as a direct result of the an azerbaijani official described the sea as  a burial ground     where people the 2013  lampedusa migrant shipwreck  the italian government decided to strengthen the national system for the patrolling of the mediterranean sea by authorising  operation mare nostrum   a military and humanitarian mission in order to rescue the migrants and arrest the traffickers of immigrants  in 2015,  more than one million migrants crossed the mediterranean sea into mediterranean sea is connected to the atlantic ocean by the strait of gibraltar  known in homer s writings as the  pillars of hercules   in the west and to the sea of marmara and the black sea  by the dardanelles and the bosporus respectively  in the east  the sea of marmara  dardanelles  is often considered a part of the mediterranean sea  whereas the black sea is

grapes  oranges  tangerines  and cork the international hydrographic organization defines the limits of the mediterranean sea as from the strait of gibraltar in the west to the entrances to the dardanelles and the suez canal in the east  the mediterranean sea is bounded by the coasts of europe  africa and asia  and is divided into two deep basins being nearly landlocked affects conditions in the mediterranean sea  for instance  tides are very limited as a result of the narrow connection with the atlantic ocean  the mediterranean is characterised and immediately recognised by its deep blue colour evaporation greatly exceeds precipitation and river runoff in the mediterranean  a fact that is central to the water circulation within the evaporation is especially high in its eastern half  causing the water level to decrease and salinity to increase the salinity at 5  m depth is pressure gradient pushes relatively cool  low-salinity  water from the atlantic across the basin  it warms and becomes saltier as it travels east  then sinks in the region of the levant and circulates westward  to spill over the strait of thus  seawater flow is eastward in the strait s surface waters  and westward below  once in the atlantic  this chemically distinct mediterranean intermediate water can persist thousands of kilometres away from its temperature of the water in the deepest part of the mediterranean sea is 13.2  °c (55.8  following countries have a coastline on the mediterranean sea several other territories also border the mediterranean sea  from west to east   the british overseas territory of gibraltar  the spanish autonomous cities of ceuta and melilla and nearby islands  the sovereign base areas on cyprus  and the gaza strip major cities  municipalities  with populations larger than 200,000  people bordering the mediterranean sea are according to the international hydrographic organization  iho   the mediterranean sea is subdivided into a number of smaller waterbodies  each with their own designation  from west to not recognised by the iho treaties  there are some other seas whose names have been in common use from the ancient times  or in the present many of these smaller seas feature in local myth and folklore and derive their names from these associations in addition to the seas  a number of gulfs and straits are also recognised the geologic history of the mediterranean sea is complex  underlain by oceanic crust  the sea basin was once thought to be a tectonic remnant of the ancient tethys ocean  it is now known to be a structurally younger basin  called the neotethys  which was first formed by the convergence of the african and eurasian plates during the late triassic and early jurassic  because it is a near-landlocked  body of water in a normally dry climate  the mediterranean is subject to intensive evaporation and the precipitation of evaporites  the messinian salinity crisis started about six million years ago  mya  when the mediterranean became landlocked  and then essentially dried up  there are salt deposits accumulated on the bottom of the basin of more than a million cubic kilometres—in some places more than three kilometres estimate that the sea was last filled about 5.3  million years ago  mya  in less than two years by the zanclean flood  water poured in from the atlantic ocean through a newly breached gateway now called the strait of gibraltar at an estimated rate of about three orders of magnitude  one thousand times  larger than the current flow of the amazon mediterranean sea has an average depth of 1,500  m (4,900  ft  and the deepest recorded point is 5,267  m (17,280  ft  in the calypso deep in the ionian sea  the coastline extends for 46,000  km (29,000  mi   a shallow submarine ridge  the strait of sicily  between the island of sicily and the coast of tunisia divides the sea in two main subregions  the western mediterranean  with an area of about 850  thousand km2  (330  thousand mi2);  and the eastern mediterranean  of about 1.65  million km2  (640  thousand mi2).  a characteristic of the coastal mediterranean are submarine karst springs or vruljas  which discharge pressurised groundwater into the coastal seawater from below the surface  the discharge water is usually fresh  and sometimes may be mediterranean basin and sea system was established by the ancient african-arabian  continent colliding with the eurasian continent  as africa-arabia  drifted northward  it closed over the ancient tethys ocean which had earlier separated the two supercontinents laurasia and gondwana  at about that time in the middle jurassic period a much smaller sea basin  dubbed the neotethys  was formed shortly before the tethys ocean closed at its western  arabian  end  the broad line of collisions pushed up a very long system of mountains from the pyrenees in spain to the zagros mountains in iran in an episode of mountain-building  tectonics known as the alpine orogeny  the neotethys grew larger during the episodes of collisions  and associated foldings and subductions  that occurred during the oligocene and miocene epochs (34  to 5.33  mya   see animation  africa-arabia  colliding with eurasia  accordingly  the mediterranean basin consists of several stretched tectonic plates in subduction which are the foundation of the eastern part of the mediterranean sea  various zones of subduction harbour and form the deepest and most majestic oceanic ridges  east of the ionian sea and south of the aegean  the central indian ridge runs east of the mediterranean sea south-east  across the in-between  of africa and the arabian peninsula into the indian ocean  nevertheless  while man-made  geopolitical turmoil and chaos have governed the coastlines of many various mediterranean nations throughout the courses of ancient  modern  present and foreseeable history  the plate tectonic status of nations bordering the mediterranean sea will find sharing the same geological concerns and fate during mesozoic and cenozoic times  as the northwest corner of africa converged on iberia  it lifted the betic-rif  mountain belts across southern iberia and northwest africa  there the development of the intramontane betic and rif basins led to creating two roughly-parallel  marine gateways between the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea  dubbed the betic and rifian corridors  they progressively closed during middle and late miocene times  perhaps several during late miocene times the closure of the betic corridor triggered the so-called   messinian salinity crisis   msc   when the mediterranean almost entirely dried out  the time of beginning of the msc was recently estimated astronomically at 5.96  mya  and it persisted for some 630,000  years until about 5.3  see animation  messinian salinity crisis  at right after the initial drawdown and re-flooding  there followed more episodes—the total number is debated—of sea drawdowns and re-floodings  for the duration of the msc  it ended when the atlantic ocean last re-flooded  the basin—creating the strait of gibraltar and causing the zanclean flood—at the end of the miocene (5.33  mya   some research has suggested that a desiccation-flooding-desiccation  cycle may have repeated several times  which could explain several events of large amounts of salt recent studies  however  show that repeated desiccation and re-flooding  is unlikely from a geodynamic point of view  present-day  atlantic gateway  i e  the strait of gibraltar  originated in the early pliocene via the zanclean flood  as mentioned  two other gateways preceded gibraltar  the betic corridor across southern spain and the rifian corridor across northern morocco  the former gateway closed about six (6)  mya  causing the messinian salinity crisis  msc   the latter or possibly both gateways closed during the earlier tortonian times  causing a  tortonian salinity crisis   from 11.6  to 7.2  mya   which occurred well before the msc and lasted much longer  both  crises  resulted in broad connections of the mainlands of africa and europe  which thereby normalised migrations of flora and fauna—especially large mammals including primates—between the two continents  the vallesian crisis indicates a typical extinction and replacement of mammal species in europe during tortonian times following climatic upheaval and overland migrations of new see animation  messinian salinity crisis  and mammal migrations   at right the near-completely  enclosed configuration of the mediterranean basin has enabled the oceanic gateways to dominate seawater circulation and the environmental evolution of the sea and basin  circulation patterns are also affected by several other factors—including climate  bathymetry  and water chemistry and temperature—which are interactive and can induce precipitation of evaporites  deposits of evaporites accumulated earlier in the nearby carpathian foredeep during the middle miocene  and the adjacent red sea basin  during the late miocene   and in the whole mediterranean basin  during the msc and the messinian age   diatomites are regularly found underneath the evaporite deposits  suggesting a connection between their geneses today  evaporation of surface seawater  output  is more than the supply  input  of fresh water by precipitation and coastal drainage systems  causing the salinity of the mediterranean to be much higher than that of the atlantic—so much so that the saltier mediterranean waters sink below the waters incoming from the atlantic  causing a two-layer  flow across the gibraltar strait  that is  an outflow submarine current of warm saline mediterranean water  counterbalanced by an inflow surface current of less saline cold oceanic water from the atlantic  herman sörgel s atlantropa project proposal in the 1920s  proposed a hydroelectric dam to be built across the strait of gibraltar  using the inflow current to provide a large amount of hydroelectric energy  the underlying energy grid was as well intended to support a political union between europe and  at least  the marghreb part of africa  compare eurafrika for the later impact and desertec for a later project with some parallels in the planned end of the miocene also marked a change in the climate of the mediterranean basin  fossil evidence from that period reveals that the larger basin had a humid subtropical climate with rainfall in the summer supporting laurel forests  the shift to a  mediterranean climate  occurred largely within the last three million years  the late pliocene epoch  as summer rainfall decreased  the subtropical laurel forests retreated  and even as they persisted on the islands of macaronesia off the atlantic coast of iberia and north africa  the present mediterranean vegetation evolved  dominated by coniferous trees and sclerophyllous trees and shrubs with small  hard  waxy leaves that prevent moisture loss in the dry summers  much of these forests and shrublands have been altered beyond recognition by thousands of years of human habitation  there are now very few relatively intact natural areas in what was once a heavily wooded region because of its latitudinal position and its land-locked  configuration  the mediterranean is especially sensitive to astronomically induced climatic variations  which are well documented in its sedimentary record  since the mediterranean is involved in the deposition of eolian dust from the sahara during dry periods  whereas riverine detrital input prevails during wet ones  the mediterranean marine sapropel-bearing  sequences provide high-resolution  climatic information  these data have been employed in reconstructing astronomically calibrated time scales for the last 9  ma of the earth s history  helping to constrain the time of past geomagnetic furthermore  the exceptional accuracy of these paleoclimatic records has improved our knowledge of the earth s orbital variations in the past as a result of the drying of the sea during the messinian salinity the marine biota of the mediterranean are derived primarily from the atlantic ocean  the north atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient-rich  than the mediterranean  and the marine life of the mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded the alboran sea is a transition zone between the two seas  containing a mix of mediterranean and atlantic species  the alboran sea has the largest population of bottlenose dolphins in the western mediterranean  is home to the last population of harbour porpoises in the mediterranean  and is the most important feeding grounds for loggerhead sea turtles in europe  the alboran sea also hosts important commercial fisheries  including sardines and swordfish  the mediterranean monk seals live in the aegean sea in greece  in 2003,  the world wildlife fund raised concerns about the widespread drift net fishing endangering populations of dolphins  turtles  and other marine animals such as the ogre cancer for 4,000  years  human activity has transformed most parts of mediterranean europe  and the  humanisation of the landscape  overlapped with the appearance of the present mediterranean the image of a simplistic  environmental determinist notion of a mediterranean paradise on earth in antiquity  which was destroyed by later civilisations dates back to at least the 18th  century and was for centuries fashionable in archaeological and historical circles  based on a broad variety of methods  e g  historical documents  analysis of trade relations  floodplain sediments  pollen  tree-ring  and further archaeometric analyses and population studies  alfred thomas grove and oliver rackham s work on  the nature of mediterranean europe  challenges this common wisdom of a mediterranean europe as a  lost eden   a formerly fertile and forested region  that had been progressively degraded and desertified by human the belief stems more from the failure of the recent landscape to measure up to the imaginary past of the classics as idealised by artists  poets and scientists of the early modern historical evolution of climate  vegetation and landscape in southern europe from prehistoric times to the present is much more complex and underwent various changes  for example  some of the deforestation had already taken place before the roman age  while in the roman age large enterprises as the latifundiums took effective care of forests and agriculture  the largest depopulation effects came with the end of the empire  assume that the major deforestation took place in modern times — the later usage patterns were also quite different e g  in southern and northern italy  also  the climate has usually been unstable and showing various ancient and modern  little ice and plant cover accommodated to various extremes and became resilient with regard to various patterns of human was therefore not the cause of climate change but followed the wide ecological diversity typical of mediterranean europe is predominantly based on human behavior  as it is and has been closely related human usage the diversity range was enhanced by the widespread exchange and interaction of the longstanding and highly diverse local agriculture  intense transport and trade relations  and the interaction with settlements  pasture and other land use  the greatest human-induced  changes  however  came after world war ii  respectively in line with the as rural populations throughout the region abandoned traditional subsistence economies  grove and rackham suggest that the locals left the traditional agricultural patterns towards taking a role as scenery-setting  agents for the then much more important  tourism  travellers  this resulted in more monotonous  large-scale  among further current important threats to mediterranean landscapes are overdevelopment of coastal areas  abandonment of mountains and  as mentioned  the loss of variety via the reduction of traditional agricultural region has a variety of geological hazards which have closely interacted with human activity and land use patterns  among others  in the eastern mediterranean  the thera eruption  dated to the 17th  or 16th  century bc  caused a large tsunami that some experts hypothesise devastated the minoan civilisation on the nearby island of crete  further leading some to believe that this may have been the catastrophe that inspired the atlantis mount vesuvius is the only active volcano on the european mainland  while others as mount etna and stromboli are to be found on neighbouring islands  the region around vesuvius including the phlegraean fields caldera west of naples are quite and constitute the most densely populated volcanic region in the world and eruptive event may occur within itself is regarded as quite dangerous due to a tendency towards explosive  plinian  it is best known for its eruption in ad 79  that led to the burying and destruction of the roman cities of pompeii and herculaneum the large experience of member states and regional authorities has led to exchange on the international level with cooperation of ngos  states  regional and municipality authorities and private the greek–turkish earthquake diplomacy is a quite positive example of natural hazards leading to improved relations of traditional rivals in the region after earthquakes in i̇zmir and athens 1999.  the european union solidarity fund  eusf  was set up to respond to major natural disasters and express european solidarity to disaster-stricken  regions within all of the largest amount of fund requests in the eu is being directed to forest fires  followed by floodings and earthquakes  forest fires are  whether man made or natural  an often recurring and dangerous hazard in the mediterranean also  tsunamis are an often underestimated hazard in the region  for example  the 1908  messina earthquake and tsunami took more than 123,000  lives in sicily and calabria and is among the most deadly natural disasters in modern europe unlike the vast multidirectional ocean currents in open oceans within their respective oceanic zones  biodiversity in the mediterranean sea is that of a stable one due to the subtle but strong locked nature of currents which affects favorably  even the smallest macroscopic type of volcanic life form  the stable marine ecosystem of the mediterranean sea and sea temperature provides a nourishing environment for life in the deep sea to flourish while assuring a balanced aquatic ecosystem excluded from any external deep oceanic factors the opening of the suez canal in 1869  created the first salt-water  passage between the mediterranean and red sea  the red sea is higher than the eastern mediterranean  so the canal serves as a tidal strait that pours red sea water into the mediterranean  the bitter lakes  which are hyper-saline  natural lakes that form part of the canal  blocked the migration of red sea species into the mediterranean for many decades  but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the red sea  the barrier to migration was removed  and plants and animals from the red sea have begun to colonise the eastern mediterranean  the red sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor  than the atlantic  so the red sea species have advantages over atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor  eastern mediterranean  accordingly  red sea species invade the mediterranean biota  and not vice versa  this phenomenon is known as the lessepsian migration  after ferdinand de lesseps  the french engineer  or erythrean invasion  the construction of the aswan high dam across the nile river in the 1960s  reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient-rich  silt from the nile into the eastern mediterranean  making conditions there even more like the red sea and worsening the impact of the invasive species invasive species have become a major component of the mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the mediterranean ecology  endangering many local and endemic mediterranean species  a first look at some groups of exotic species show that more than 70%  of the non-indigenous  decapods and about 63%  of the exotic fishes occurring in the mediterranean are of indo pacific introduced into the mediterranean through the suez canal  this makes the canal as the first pathway of arrival of  alien  species into the mediterranean  the impacts of some lessepsian species have proven to be considerable mainly in the levantine basin of the mediterranean  where they are replacing native species and becoming a  familiar sight  according to the international union for conservation of nature definition  as well as convention on biological diversity  cbd  and ramsar convention terminologies  they are alien species  as they are non-native  (non-indigenous)  to the mediterranean sea  and they are outside their normal area of distribution which is the indo-pacific  region  when these species succeed in establishing populations in the mediterranean sea  compete with and begin to replace native species they are  alien invasive species   as they are an agent of change and a threat to the native biodiversity  in the context of cbd   introduction  refers to the movement by human agency  indirect or direct  of an alien species outside of its natural range  past or present   the suez canal  being an artificial  man made  canal  is a human agency  lessepsian migrants are therefore  introduced  species  indirect  and unintentional   whatever wording is chosen  they represent a threat to the native mediterranean biodiversity  because they are non-indigenous  to this sea  in recent years  the egyptian government s announcement of its intentions to deepen and widen the canal have raised concerns from marine biologists  fearing that such an act will only worsen the invasion of red sea species into the mediterranean  facilitating the crossing of the canal for yet additional recent decades  the arrival of exotic species from the tropical atlantic has become a noticeable feature  whether this reflects an expansion of the natural area of these species that now enter the mediterranean through the gibraltar strait  because of a warming trend of the water caused by global warming  or an extension of the maritime traffic  or is simply the result of a more intense scientific investigation  is still an open question  while not as intense as the  lessepsian  movement  the process may be scientific interest and may therefore warrant increased levels of needed by 2100  the overall level of the mediterranean could rise between 3  to 61  cm (1.2  to 24.0  in  as a result of the effects of climate this could have adverse effects on populations across the mediterranean coastal ecosystems also appear to be threatened by sea level rise  especially enclosed seas such as the baltic  the mediterranean and the black sea  these seas have only small and

and protect and improve the marine environment in the area  thereby contributing to its sustainable many marine species have been almost wiped out because of the sea s pollution  one of them is the mediterranean monk seal which is considered to be among the world s most endangered marine mediterranean is also plagued by marine debris  a 1994  study of the seabed using trawl nets around the coasts of spain  france and italy reported a particularly high mean concentration of debris  an average of 1,935  items per km2.  plastic debris accounted for 76%,  of which 94%  was plastic of the world s busiest shipping routes are in the mediterranean sea  it is estimated that approximately 220,000  merchant vessels of more than 100  tonnes cross the mediterranean sea each year—about one third of the world s total merchant shipping  these ships often carry hazardous cargo  which if lost would result in severe damage to the marine environment the discharge of chemical tank washings and oily wastes also represent a significant source of marine pollution  the mediterranean sea constitutes 0.7%  of the global water surface and yet receives 17%  of global marine oil pollution  it is estimated that every year between 100,000  t (98,000  long tons  and 150,000  t (150,000  long tons  of crude oil are deliberately released into the sea from shipping activities approximately 370,000,000  t (360,000,000  long tons  of oil are transported annually in the mediterranean sea  more than 20%  of the world total   with around 250–300  oil tankers crossing the sea every day  accidental oil spills happen frequently with an average of 10  spills per year  a major oil spill could occur at any time in any part of the mediterranean sea is arguably among the most culturally diverse block basin sea regions in the world  with a unique combination of pleasant climate  beautiful coastline  rich history and various cultures  the mediterranean region is the most popular tourist destination in the world—attracting approximately one third of the world s international needed tourism is one of the most important sources of income for many mediterranean countries regardless of the man-made  geopolitical conflicts that harbour coastal nations  in that regard  authorities around the mediterranean have made it a point to extinguish rising man-made  chaotic zones that would affect the economies  societies in neighboring coastal countries  let alone shipping routes  naval and rescue components in the mediterranean sea are considered one of the very best due to the quick intercooperation of various naval fleets within proximity of each other  unlike the vast open oceans  the closed nature of the mediterranean sea provides a much more adaptable naval initiative among the coastal countries to provide effective naval and rescue missions  considered the safest and regardless of any man-made  or natural disaster tourism also supports small communities in coastal areas and islands by providing alternative sources of income far from urban centers  however  tourism has also played major role in the degradation of the coastal and marine environment  rapid development has been encouraged by mediterranean governments to support the large numbers of tourists visiting the region each year  but this has caused serious disturbance to marine habitats such as erosion and pollution in many places along the mediterranean coasts tourism often concentrates in areas of high natural wealth  causing a serious threat to the habitats of endangered mediterranean species such as sea turtles and monk seals  reductions in natural wealth may reduce incentives for tourists to stock levels in the mediterranean sea are alarmingly low  the european environment agency says that more than 65%  of all fish stocks in the region are outside safe biological limits and the united nations food and agriculture organisation  that some of the most important fisheries—such as albacore and bluefin tuna  hake  marlin  swordfish  red mullet and sea bream—are missing there are clear indications that catch size and quality have declined  often dramatically  and in many areas larger and longer-lived  species have disappeared entirely from commercial catches large open water fish like tuna have been a shared fisheries resource for thousands of years but the stocks are now dangerously low  in 1999,  greenpeace published a report revealing that the amount of bluefin tuna in the mediterranean had decreased by over 80%  in the previous 20  years and government scientists warn that without immediate action the stock will collapse aquaculture is expanding rapidly—often without proper environmental assessment—and currently accounts for 30%  of the fish protein consumed worldwide  the industry claims that farmed seafood lessens the pressure on wild fish stocks  yet many of the farmed species are carnivorous  consuming up to five times their weight in wild fish mediterranean coastal areas are already over exposed to human influence  with pristine areas becoming ever scarcer  the aquaculture sector adds to this pressure  requiring areas of high water quality to set up farms  the installation of fish farms close to vulnerable and important habitats such as seagrass meadows is particularly concerning beach of hammamet  tunisiathe
