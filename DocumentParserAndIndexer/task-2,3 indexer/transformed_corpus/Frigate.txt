 a frigate  ˈfrɪɡɪt  is any of several types of warship  the term having been used for ships of various sizes and roles over the last few centuries in the 17th  century  this term was used for any warship built for speed and maneuverability  the description often used being "frigate-built".  these could be warships carrying their principal batteries of carriage-mounted  guns on a single deck or on two decks  with further smaller carriage-mounted  guns usually carried on the forecastle and quarterdeck of the vessel   the term was generally used for ships too small to stand in the line of battle  although early line-of-battle  ships were frequently referred to as frigates when they were built for speed in the 18th  century  the term referred to ships that were usually as long as a ship of the line and were square-rigged  on all three masts  full rigged   but were faster and with lighter armament  used for patrolling and escort  in the definition adopted by the british admiralty  they were rated ships of at least 28  guns  carrying their principal armaments upon a single continuous deck — the upper deck — while ships of the line possessed two or more continuous decks bearing batteries of guns in the late 19th  century  beginning about 1858  with the construction of prototypes by the british and french navies   the armoured frigate was a type of ironclad warship that for a time was the most powerful type of vessel afloat  the term  frigate  was used because such ships still mounted their principal armaments on a single continuous upper deck in modern navies  frigates are used to protect other warships and merchant-marine  ships  especially as anti-submarine  warfare  asw  combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces  underway replenishment groups  and merchant convoys  ship classes dubbed  frigates  have also more closely resembled corvettes  destroyers  cruisers  and even battleships  some european navies such as the french  german or spanish ones use the term  frigate  for both their destroyers and needed  the rank  frigate captain  derives from the name of this type of ship the term  frigate   italian  fregata  spanish catalan portuguese sicilian  fragata  dutch  fregat  french  frégate  originated in the mediterranean in the late 15th  century  referring to a lighter galleass type ship with oars  sails and a light armament  built for speed and the etymology of the word is unknown  although it may have originated as a corruption of aphractus  a latin word for an open vessel with no lower deck  aphractus was  in turn  derived from the ancient greek phrase ἄφρακτος ναῦς  aphraktos naus   or  undefended ship  in 1583,  during the eighty years  war  habsburg spain recovered the southern netherlands from the rebellious dutch  this soon led to the occupied ports being used as bases for privateers  the dunkirkers  to attack the shipping of the dutch and their allies  to achieve this they developed small  maneuverable  sailing vessels that came to be referred to as frigates  the success of these dunkirker vessels influenced the ship design of other navies contending with them but because most regular navies required ships of greater endurance than the dunkirker frigates could provide  the term was soon applied less exclusively to any relatively fast and elegant sail-only  war ship  in french  the term  frigate  became a verb  meaning  to build long and low   and an adjective  adding further confusion  even the huge english sovereign of the seas could be described as  a delicate frigate  by a contemporary after her upper decks were reduced in navy of the dutch republic was the first navy to build the larger ocean-going  frigates  the dutch navy had three principal tasks in the struggle against spain  to protect dutch merchant ships at sea  to blockade the ports of spanish-held  flanders to damage trade and halt enemy privateering  and to fight the spanish fleet and prevent troop landings  the first two tasks required speed  shallowness of draft for the shallow waters around the netherlands  and the ability to carry sufficient supplies to maintain a blockade  the third task required heavy armament  sufficient to fight against the spanish fleet  the first of these larger battle-capable  frigates were built around 1600  at hoorn in by the later stages of the eighty years  war the dutch had switched entirely from the heavier ships still used by the english and spanish to the lighter frigates  carrying around 40  guns and weighing around 300  tons the effectiveness of the dutch frigates became most visible in the battle of the downs in 1639,  encouraging most other navies  especially the english  to adopt similar designs the fleets built by the commonwealth of england in the 1650s  generally consisted of ships described as  frigates   the largest of which were two-decker   great frigates  of the third rate  carrying 60  guns  these vessels were as big and capable as  great ships  of the time  however  most other frigates at the time were used as  cruisers   independent fast ships  the term  frigate  implied a long hull design  which relates directly to speed  see hull speed  and also  in turn  helped the development of the broadside tactic in naval warfare at this time  a further design evolved  reintroducing oars to create the galley frigate such as hms charles galley of 1676  which was rated as a 32-gun  fifth rate but also had a bank of 40  oars set below the upper deck which could be used to propel the ship in the absence of a favourable wind in danish  the word  fregat  is often applied to warships carrying as few as 16  guns  such as hms falcon which the british classified as a sloop under the rating system of the royal navy  by the middle of the 18th  century  the term  frigate  was technically restricted to single-decked  ships of the fifth rate  though small 28-gun  frigates were classed as sixth classic sailing frigate  well-known  today for its role in the napoleonic wars  can be traced back to french developments in the second quarter of the 18th  century  the french-built  médée of 1740  is often regarded as the first example of this type  these ships were square-rigged  and carried all their main guns on a single continuous upper deck  the lower deck  known as the  gun deck   now carried no armament  and functioned as a  berth deck  where the crew lived  and was in fact placed below the waterline of the new total of fifty-nine  french sailing frigates were built between 1777  and 1790,  with a standard design averaging a hull length of 135  ft (41  m  and an average draught of 13  ft (4.0  m   the new frigates recorded sailing speeds of up to 14  knots (26  km h  16  mph   significantly faster than their predecessor they were able to fight with all their guns when the seas were so rough that comparable two-deckers  had to close the gun-ports  on their lower decks  see the action of 13  january 1797,  for an example when this was decisive   like the larger 74  which was developed at the same time  the new frigates sailed well and were good fighting vessels due to a combination of long hulls and low upperworks compared to vessels of comparable size and firepower the royal navy captured a handful of the new french frigates during the war of the austrian succession (1740–1748)  and were impressed by them  particularly for their inshore handling capabilities  they soon built copies and started to adapt the type to their own needs  setting the standard for other frigates as the leading naval power  the first british frigates carried 28  guns including an upper deck battery of twenty-four  9-pounder  guns  the remaining four smaller guns were carried on the quarter deck  but soon developed into fifth-rate  ships of 32  or 36  guns including an upper deck battery of twenty-six  12-pounder  guns  with the remaining six or ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle  from around 1778,  a larger  heavy  frigate was developed with a main battery of twenty-six  or twenty-eight  18-pounder  guns  again with the remaining ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle  both british and american frigates could  and usually did  additionally carry smaller carriage-mounted  guns on their quarter decks and forecastles  the superstructures above the upper deck   technically  rated ships with fewer than 28  guns could not be classed as frigates but as  post ships   however  in common parlance most post ships were often described as  frigates   the same casual misuse of the term being extended to smaller two-decked  ships that were too small to stand in the line of battle royal navy frigates of the late 18th  century included the 1780-vintage  perseverance class  which measured around 900  tons burthen and carried 36  guns  this successful class was followed by numerous other classes that measured over 1,000  tons burthen and carried 38  guns in 1797,  three of the united states navy s first six major ships were rated as 44-gun  frigates  or "super-frigates"),  which operationally carried fifty-six  to sixty 24-pounder  long guns and 32-pounder  or 42-pounder  carronades on two decks  by all regards they were exceptionally powerful and tough  these ships were so well-armed  that they were often regarded as equal to ships of the line  and after a series of losses at the outbreak of the war of 1812,  royal navy fighting instructions ordered british frigates  usually of 38  guns or less  to never engage american frigates at any less than a 2:1  advantage  uss constitution  preserved as a museum ship by the us navy  is the oldest commissioned warship afloat  and is a surviving example of a frigate from the age of sail  constitution and her sister ships president and united states were created in a response to deal with the barbary coast pirates and in conjunction with the naval act of 1794.  the three big frigates  when built  had a distinctive building pattern which minimised  hogging   in which the centre of the keel rises while both ends drop  and improves hydrodynamic hull was designed so that all the weight from the guns was upon the keel itself  joshua humphreys proposed that only live oak  a tree that grew only in america  should be used to build these ships  the method was to use diagonal riders  eight on each side that sat at a 45  degree angle  these beams of live oak were about 2  feet (61  cm  wide and around 1  foot (30  cm  thick and helped to maintain the shape of the hull  serving also to reduce flexibility and to minimize these ideas were considered revolutionary in the late 18th  and early 19th  century  a three-layer  method was used in which the planks along the sides of the hull were laid horizontally across the frames  making a crossing or checker board pattern  the sides of the ship could be as thick as 25  inches (64  cm   and were able to absorb substantial damage  the strength of this braced construction earned uss constitution the nickname  old needed frigates were perhaps the hardest-worked  of warship types during the age of sail  while smaller than a ship-of-the-line,  they were formidable opponents for the large numbers of sloops and gunboats  not to mention privateers or merchantmen  able to carry six months  stores  they had very long range  and vessels larger than frigates were considered too valuable to operate independently frigates scouted for the fleet  went on commerce-raiding  missions and patrols  and conveyed messages and dignitaries  usually  frigates would fight in small numbers or singly against other frigates  they would avoid contact with ships-of-the-line;  even in the midst of a fleet engagement it was bad etiquette for a ship of the line to fire on an enemy frigate which had not fired frigates were involved in fleet battles  often as  repeating frigates   in the smoke and confusion of battle  signals made by the fleet commander  whose flagship might be in the thick of the fighting  might be missed by the other ships of the frigates were therefore stationed to windward or leeward of the main line of battle  and had to maintain a clear line of sight to the commander s flagship  signals from the flagship were then repeated by the frigates  which themselves standing out of the line and clear from the smoke and disorder of battle  could be more easily seen by the other ships of the if damage or loss of masts prevented the flagship from making clear conventional signals  the repeating frigates could interpret them and hoist their own in the correct manner  passing on the commander s instructions officers in the royal navy  a frigate was a desirable posting  frigates often saw action  which meant a greater chance of glory  promotion  and prize money unlike larger ships that were placed in ordinary  frigates were kept in service in peacetime as a cost-saving  measure and to provide experience to frigate captains and officers which would be useful in wartime  frigates could also carry marines for boarding enemy ships or for operations on shore  in 1832,  the frigate uss potomac landed a party of 282  sailors and marines ashore in the us navy s first sumatran expedition common armament was one gundeck with 24–30  long guns  from 8-  to 24-pounders  (3.6  to 11  kg   with up to a dozen light guns or carronades on the quarterdeck and forecastle above frigates remained a crucial element of navies until the mid-19th  century  the first ironclads were classified as  frigates  because of the number of guns they carried  however  terminology changed as iron and steam became the norm  and the role of the frigate was assumed first by the protected cruiser and then by the light cruiser frigates are often the vessel of choice in historical naval novels due to their relative freedom compared to ships of the line  kept for fleet actions  and smaller vessels  generally assigned to a home port and less widely ranging   for example  the patrick o brian aubrey–maturin series  c  s  forester s horatio hornblower series and alexander kent s richard bolitho series  the motion picture master and commander  the far side of the world features a reconstructed historic frigate  hms rose  to depict aubrey s frigate hms surprise vessels classed as frigates continued to play a great role in navies with the adoption of steam power in the 19th  century  in the 1830s,  navies experimented with large paddle steamers equipped with large guns mounted on one deck  which were termed  paddle frigates  from the mid-1840s  on  frigates which more closely resembled the traditional sailing frigate were built with steam engines and screw propellers  these  screw frigates   built first of wood and later of iron  continued to perform the traditional role of the frigate until late in the 19th  century from 1859,  armour was added to ships based on existing frigate and ship of the line designs  the additional weight of the armour on these first ironclad warships meant that they could have only one gun deck  and they were technically frigates  even though they were more powerful than existing ships-of-the-line  and occupied the same strategic role  the phrase  armoured frigate  remained in use for some time to denote a sail-equipped,  broadside-firing  type of ironclad after 1875,  the term  frigate  fell out of use  vessels with armoured sides were designated as  battleships  or  armoured cruisers   while  protected cruisers  only possessed an armoured deck  and unarmoured vessels  including frigates and sloops  were classified as  unprotected cruisers  modern frigates are related to earlier frigates only by name  the term  frigate  was readopted during the second world war by the british royal navy to describe an anti-submarine  escort vessel that was larger than a corvette  while smaller than a destroyer  equal in size and capability to the american destroyer escort  frigates are usually less expensive to build and anti-submarine  escorts had previously been classified as sloops by the royal navy  and the black swan-class  sloops of 1939–1945  were as large as the new types of frigate  and more heavily armed  twenty-two  of these were reclassified as frigates after the war  as were the remaining 24  smaller castle-class  corvettes the frigate was introduced to remedy some of the shortcomings inherent in the corvette design  limited armament  a hull form not suited to open-ocean  work  a single shaft which limited speed and maneuverability  and a lack of range  the frigate was designed and built to the same mercantile construction standards  scantlings  as the corvette  allowing manufacture by yards unused to warship construction  the first frigates of the river class (1941)  were essentially two sets of corvette machinery in one larger hull  armed with the latest hedgehog anti-submarine  weapon the frigate possessed less offensive firepower and speed than a destroyer  but such qualities were not required for anti-submarine  warfare  submarines were slow while submerged  and asdic sets did not operate effectively at speeds of over 20  knots (23  mph  37  km h   rather  the frigate was an austere and weatherly vessel suitable for mass-construction  and fitted with the latest innovations in anti-submarine  warfare  as the frigate was intended purely for convoy duties  and not to deploy with the fleet  it had limited range and speed the contemporary german flottenbegleiter   fleet escorts    also known as "f-boats",  were essentially they were based on a pre-war  oberkommando der marine concept of vessels which could fill roles such as fast minesweeper  minelayer  merchant escort and anti-submarine  vessel  because of the treaty of versailles their displacement was officially limited to 600  tons  although in reality they exceeded this by about 100  tons  f-boats  had two stacks and two 105  mm gun turrets  the design was flawed because of its narrow beam  sharp bow and unreliable high pressure steam turbines  f-boats  were succeeded in operational duties by type 35  and elbing class torpedo boats  flottenbegleiter remained in service as advanced training vessels it was not until the royal navy s bay class of 1944  that a british design classified as a  frigate  was produced for fleet use  although it still suffered from limited speed  these anti-aircraft  frigates  built on incomplete loch-class  frigate hulls  were similar to the united states navy s destroyer escorts  de   although the latter had greater speed and offensive armament to better suit them to fleet deployments  the destroyer escort concept came from design studies by the general board of the united states navy in 1940,  as modified by requirements established by a british commission in prior to the american entry into the war  for deep-water  escorts  the american-built  destroyer escorts serving in the british royal navy were rated as captain-class  frigates  the u s  navy s two canadian-built  asheville-class  and 96  british-influenced,  american-built  tacoma-class  frigates that followed originally were classified as  patrol gunboats   pg  in the u s  navy but on 15  april 1943  were all reclassified as patrol frigates  pf  the introduction of the surface-to-air  missile after world war ii made relatively small ships effective for anti-aircraft  warfare  the  guided missile frigate   in the usn  these vessels were called  ocean escorts  and designated  de  or  deg  until 1975  – a holdover from the world war ii destroyer escort or  de   the royal canadian navy and british royal navy maintained the use of the term  frigate   likewise  the french navy refers to missile-equipped  ship  up to cruiser-sized  ships  suffren  tourville  and horizon classes   by the name of  frégate   while smaller units are named aviso  the soviet navy used the term "guard-ship"   сторожевой корабль  from the 1950s  to the 1970s,  the united states navy commissioned ships classed as guided missile frigates  hull classification symbol dlg or dlgn  literally meaning guided missile destroyer leaders   which were actually anti-aircraft  warfare cruisers built on destroyer-style  hulls  these had one or two twin launchers per ship for the rim-2  terrier missile  upgraded to the rim-67  standard er missile in the 1980s.  this type of ship was intended primarily to defend aircraft carriers against anti-ship  cruise missiles  augmenting and eventually replacing converted world war ii cruisers  cag clg cg  in this role  the guided missile frigates also had an anti-submarine  capability that most of the world war ii cruiser conversions lacked  some of these ships — bainbridge and truxtun along with the california and virginia classes — were nuclear-powered  these  frigates  were roughly mid-way  in size between cruisers and destroyers  this was similar to the use of the term  frigate  during the age of sail during which it referred to a medium-sized  warship  but it was inconsistent with conventions used by other contemporary navies which regarded frigates as being smaller than destroyers  during the 1975  ship reclassification  the large american frigates were redesignated as guided missile cruisers or destroyers  cg cgn ddg   while ocean escorts  the american classification for ships smaller than destroyers  with hull symbol de deg  destroyer escort   were reclassified as frigates  ff ffg   sometimes incorrectly called  fast frigates   in the late 1970s  the us navy introduced the 51-ship  oliver hazard perry-class  guided missile frigates  ffg   the last of which was decommissioned in 2015,  although some serve in other by 1995  the older guided missile cruisers and destroyers were replaced by the ticonderoga-class  cruisers and arleigh burke-class  of the most successful post-1945  designs was the british leander-class  frigate  which was used by several navies  laid down in 1959,  the leanders were based on the previous type 12  anti-submarine  frigate but equipped for anti-aircraft  use as well  they were used by the uk into the 1990s,  at which point some were sold onto other navies  the leander design  or improved versions of it  were licence-built  for other navies as well nearly all modern frigates are equipped with some form of offensive or defensive missiles  and as such are rated as guided-missile  frigates  ffg   improvements in surface-to-air  missiles  e g   the eurosam aster 15)  allow modern guided-missile  frigates to form the core of many modern navies and to be used as a fleet defence platform  without the need for specialised anti-air  warfare frigates the royal navy type 61  salisbury class were  air direction  frigates equipped to track aircraft  to this end they had reduced armament compared to the type 41  leopard-class  air-defence  frigates built on the same hull.multi-role  frigates like the meko 200,  anzac and halifax classes are designed for navies needing warships deployed in a variety of situations that a general frigate class would not be able to fulfill and not requiring the need for deploying destroyers at the opposite end of the spectrum  some frigates are specialised for anti-submarine  warfare  increasing submarine speeds towards the end of world war ii  see german type xxi submarine  greatly reduced the margin of speed superiority of frigate over submarine  the frigate could no longer be slow and powered by mercantile machinery and consequently postwar frigates  such as the whitby class  were faster such ships carry improved sonar equipment  such as the variable depth sonar or towed array  and specialised weapons such as torpedoes  forward-throwing  weapons such as limbo and missile-carried  anti-submarine  torpedoes such as asroc or ikara  surface-to-air  missiles such as sea sparrow and surface-to-surface  missiles such as exocet give them defensive and offensive capabilities  the royal navy s original type 22  frigate is an example of a specialised anti-submarine  warfare frigate especially for anti-submarine  warfare  most modern frigates have a landing deck and hangar aft to operate helicopters  eliminating the need for the frigate to close with unknown sub-surface  threats  and using fast helicopters to attack nuclear submarines which may be faster than surface warships  for this task the helicopter is equipped with sensors such as sonobuoys  wire-mounted  dipping sonar and magnetic anomaly detectors to identify possible threats  and torpedoes or depth-charges  to attack them with their onboard radar helicopters can also be used to reconnoitre over-the-horizon  targets and  if equipped with anti-ship  missiles such as penguin or sea skua  to attack them  the helicopter is also invaluable for search and rescue operation and has largely replaced the use of small boats or the jackstay rig for such duties as transferring personnel  mail and cargo between ships or to shore  with helicopters these tasks can be accomplished faster and less dangerously  and without the need for the frigate to slow down or change course stealth technology has been introduced in modern frigate design by the french la fayette class frigate shapes are designed to offer a minimal radar cross section  which also lends them good air penetration  the maneuverability of these frigates has been compared to that of sailing ships  examples are the french horizon class with the aster 15  and aster 30  missile for anti-missile  capabilities  the german f125  and sachsen-class  frigates  the turkish tf2000  type frigates with the mk-41  vls  and the indian shivalik and talwar classes with the brahmos missile system the modern french navy applies the term first-class  frigate and second-class  frigate to both destroyers and frigates in service  pennant numbers remain divided between f-series  numbers for those ships internationally recognised as frigates and d-series  pennant numbers for those more traditionally recognised as destroyers  this can result in some confusion as certain classes are referred to as frigates in french service while similar ships in other navies are referred to as destroyers  this also results in some recent classes of french ships such as the horizon class being among the largest in the world to carry the rating of frigate in the german navy  frigates were used to replace aging destroyers  however in size and role the new german frigates exceed the former class of destroyers  the future german f125-class  frigate will be the largest class of frigates worldwide with a displacement of more than 7,200  tons  the same was done in the spanish navy  which went ahead with the deployment of the first aegis frigates  the álvaro de bazán-class  frigates some new classes of ships similar to corvettes are optimized for high-speed  deployment and combat with small craft rather than combat between equal opponents  an example is the u s  littoral combat ship  lcs   as of 2015,  all oliver hazard perry-class  frigates in the united states navy have been decommissioned  and their role partially being assumed by the new lcs  while the lcs class ships are smaller than the frigate class they will replace  they offer a similar degree of weaponry while requiring less than half the crew complement and offering a top speed of over 40  knots (74  km h  46  mph   a major advantage for the lcs ships is that they are designed around specific mission modules allowing them to fulfill a variety of roles  the modular system also allows for most upgrades to be performed ashore and installed later into the ship  keeping the ships available for deployment for the maximum time the latest u s  deactivation plans means that this is the first time that the u s  navy has been without a frigate class of ships since 1943   technically uss constitution is rated as a frigate and is still in commission  but does not count towards navy force remaining 20  lcss to be acquired from 2019  and onwards that will be enhanced will be designated as frigates  and existing ships given modifications may also have their classification changed to ff as few nations have frigates on display as museum ships  they are note that algerian  tripolitan and tunisian sail frigates are listed under turkey  all italian city-state  frigates are listed under italy
