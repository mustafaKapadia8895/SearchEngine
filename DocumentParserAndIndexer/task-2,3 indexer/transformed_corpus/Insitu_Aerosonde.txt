 the aai aerosonde is a small unmanned aerial vehicle  uav  designed to collect weather data  including temperature  atmospheric pressure  humidity  and wind measurements over oceans and remote areas  the aerosonde was developed by insitu  and is now manufactured by aerosonde ltd  which is a strategic business of aai corporation  the aerosonde is powered by a modified enya r120  model aircraft engine  and carries on board a small computer  meteorological instruments  and a gps receiver for navigation  it is also used by the united states armed forces for intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance  isr  on august 21,  1998,  a phase 1  aerosonde nicknamed  laima   after the ancient latvian deity of good fortune  completed a 2,031  mile (3,270  km  flight across the atlantic ocean  this was the first crossing of the atlantic ocean by a uav  at the time  it was also the smallest aircraft ever to cross the  the smallest aircraft record was subsequently broken by the spirit of butts farm uav   launched from a roof rack of a moving car due to its lack of undercarriage  laima flew from newfoundland  canada to benbecula  an island off the coast of scotland in 26  hours 45  minutes in stormy weather  using approximately 1.5  u s  gallons (1.25  imperial gallons or 5.7  litres  of gasoline  petrol   other than for take-off  and landing  the flight was autonomous  without external control  at an altitude of 5,500  ft (1,680  meters   aerosondes have also been the first unmanned aircraft to penetrate tropical cyclones  with an initial mission in followed by eye penetrations in 5  march 2012,  the u s  special operations command  socom  awarded aai a contract to provide the aerosonde-g  for their mid-endurance  uas ii program  the catapult-launched  air vehicle has a takeoff weight 39  or 55  lb (18  or 25  kg  depending on engine type  with endurance of over 10  hours and an electro-optic/infrared  and laser-pointer  the aerosonde has been employed by socom and u s  naval air systems command  navair  under the designation mq-19  under service provision contracts  a typical system comprises four air vehicles and two ground control stations that are accommodated in tents or tailored to fit in most vehicles  the system can also include remote video terminals for individual users to uplink new navigation waypoints and sensor commands to  and receive sensor imagery and video from  the vehicle from a ruggedized tablet device  originally  the aerosonde suffered from engine-reliability  issues  but textron says it has rectified those november 2015,  textron systems was performing aerosonde operations in  eight or nine  countries for its users  including the u s  marine corps  u s  air force  and socom  as well as for commercial users consisting of a customer in the oil and gas industry  instead of buying hardware  customers pay for  sensor hours   and the company decides how many aircraft are produced to meet requirements  4,000  fee-for-service  hours were being performed monthly  and the aerosonde had exceeded 110,000  flight hours in el-005  multi fuel power plantcyclone reconnaissancelaima flight
