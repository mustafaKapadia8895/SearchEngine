 labrador sea water  lsw  is an intermediate water mass characterized by cold water  relatively low salinity compared to other intermediate water and high concentrations of both oxygen and anthropogenic it is formed by convective processes in the labrador located between greenland and the northeast coast of the labrador peninsula  deep convection in the labrador sea allows colder water to sink forming this water mass  which is a contributor to the upper layer of north atlantic deep water  north atlantic deep water flowing southward is integral to the atlantic meridional overturning the labrador sea experiences a net heat loss to the atmosphere annually convection in the labrador sea is the result of a combination of cyclonic oceanographic circulation of the sea currents and cyclonic atmospheric forcing  at the southern tip of greenland  water enters the west greenland current from the east greenland current  continues to flow northwest around the baffin bay  and then southeast into the baffin island current continuing in the same direction in the labrador current  sea ice in the winter months inhibits surface flow into baffin bay  the labrador current and the wgc flow in opposite directions resulting in a cyclonic eddy  during winter months low pressure dominates in this and in years with a positive north atlantic oscillation deeper convection is spreads through the north atlantic ocean by three routes  northeast directly into the irminger sea  into the eastern north atlantic by means of the deep north atlantic current  and meridionally via the deep western boundary oceanagrapher robert pickart  in a paper published in 2002,  presented data that suggests that the labrador sea is not the only formation site for lsw  they observed similar convective processes in the irminger sea and noted that transit times for lsw into irminger sea were unusually fast  suggesting that there is another source for lsw in the irminger sea lsw properties experience seasonal and interannual variations  in late spring and summer  large amounts of cold freshwater accumulate from melting ice and are mixed downward during convection  the source for heat in the labrador sea is modified north atlantic current water after circulating the subpolar in winter the sea becomes more saline as freshwater freezes to form sea ice  the greatest seasonal variability is largely confined to the surface waters  however an annual cycle of convective mixing and re-stratification  is observed throughout the water column  warming and increased salinity in the lower level and freshening at the surface is associated with re-stratification   may–december   whereas a convective mixing period  january–april  leads to cooling and a decrease in salt content in intermediate and deep waters and an increase in salt content at the surface  interannual variations in the intermediate lsw are due largely to changes in convectivity throughout these periods  weak convective periods are associated with more heat in the water column and deep convective periods are characterized by cold water  in the early 1990s,  several consecutive severe winters contributed towards deep convection in the labrador sea  these winters were also associated with strong positive fluctuations in the north atlantic oscillation  lsw became very cold  fresh  and dense during this period  and the layer extended to depths of 2300m  in the spring of due to weakened convection  lsw began warming significantly and increased in salinity over the following decade  this trend continued through 2010  and 2011  when weak convection was observed in relation with negative nao  deep convection was observed again in 2012  with the lsw reaching 1400m,  corresponding with a positive nao similar to those seen in the early 1990s.
