 a funnel cloud is a funnel-shaped  cloud of condensed water droplets  associated with a rotating column of wind and extending from the base of a cloud  usually a cumulonimbus or towering cumulus cloud  but not reaching the ground or a water surface  a funnel cloud is usually visible as a cone-shaped  or needle like protuberance from the main cloud base  funnel clouds form most frequently in association with supercell thunderstorms if a funnel cloud touches the ground it becomes a tornado  most tornadoes begin as funnel clouds  but many funnel clouds do not make ground contact and so do not become tornadoes  also  a tornado does not necessarily need to have an associated condensation funnelâ€”if strong cyclonic winds are occurring at the surface  and connected to a cloud base  regardless of condensation   then the feature is a tornado  some tornadoes may appear only as a debris swirl  with no obvious funnel cloud extending below the rotating cloud base in cloud nomenclature  any funnel-  or inverted-funnel-shaped  cloud depending from cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds is technically described as an accessory feature called tuba  the terms tuba and funnel cloud are nearly but not exactly synonymous  a wall cloud  for example  is also a form of tuba.cold-air  funnel clouds  vortices  are usually short-lived  and generally much weaker than the vortices produced by supercells  although cold-air  funnels rarely make ground contact  they may touch down briefly and become weak tornadoes or waterspouts unlike the related phenomenon associated with severe thunderstorms  cold-air  funnels are generally associated with partly cloudy skies in the wake of cold fronts  where atmospheric instability and moisture is sufficient to support towering cumulus clouds but not precipitation  the mixing of cooler air in the lower troposphere with air flowing in a different direction in the middle troposphere causes the rotation on a horizontal axis  which  when deflected vertically by atmospheric conditions  can become a funnel are a common sight along the pacific coast of the united states  particularly in the spring or july 29,  2013,  a cold-core  funnel cloud touched down as an ef0  tornado in ottawa  canada  causing extensive damage in the form of downed trees on a golf course  no advance weather watches or warnings were issued by environment canada  and the tornado was spawned from one of the few non-severe  storm clouds moving through the
