 a tornado warning  same code  tor  is an alert issued by national weather forecasting agencies to warn the public that severe thunderstorms with tornadoes are imminent or occurring  it can be issued after a tornado  funnel cloud and rotation in the clouds has been spotted by the public  storm chasers  emergency management or law enforcement when this happens  the tornado sirens may sound in that area if any sirens are present  informing people that a tornado has been sighted or may be forming nearby  because sirens are not intended to be heard indoors  residents should not completely depend on them   the issuance of a tornado warning indicates that residents should take immediate safety precautions it is a higher level of alert than a tornado watch  but  in the united states  it can be surpassed by an even higher alert known as a tornado emergency the first official tornado forecast – and tornado warning – was made by united states air force capt   later col   robert c  miller and major ernest fawbush  on march 25,  1948.  the first such forecast came after the events that transpired five days earlier on march 20,  1948;  miller – a california native who became stationed at tinker air force base three weeks earlier – was assigned to work the late shift as a forecaster for the base s air weather service office that evening  analyzing u s  weather bureau surface maps and upper-air  charts that failed to note atmospheric instability and moisture content present over oklahoma that would be suitable for producing thunderstorm activity  erroneously forecasting dry conditions for that night  thunderstorms soon developed southwest of oklahoma city  and at 9:30  p m   forecasters from will rogers airport sent a warning to tinker that the storm encroaching the city was producing wind gusts of 92  miles per hour (148  km h  and a  tornado south on ground moving ne   base personnel received an alert written by the staff sarg  on duty with miller  minutes before the twister struck tinker several minutes later around 10:00  p m   damaging several military aircraft  with total damage estimated at $10  million  that could not be secured in time before it crossed the base an inquiry the next day before a tribunal of five generals who traveled to tinker from washington  d c   who ruled that the march 20  tornado was an  act of not forecastable given the present state of the art   base commander gen  fred borum tasked miller and fawbush to follow up on the board s suggestion to consider methods of forecasting tornadic thunderstorms  over the next three days  miller and fawbush studied reports and charts from previous tornado events to determine the atmospheric conditions favorable for the development of tornadic activity  in an effort to predict such events with some degree of accuracy  at the time  there had not been studies on how tornadoes formed  however  military radars were being adapted for forecasting use  allowing forecasters to see the outlines of storms but not their internal attributes such as rotation  miller and fawbush s findings on atmospheric phenomenon present in past outbreaks would aid in their initial forecast  as the day s surface and upper-air  analysis charts determined the same conditions present on march 20  were present on the 25th,  concluded that central oklahoma would have the highest risk for tornadoes during the late-afternoon  and who had put together a severe weather safety plan for base personnel  then suggested that miller and fawbush issue a severe thunderstorm forecast  and then asked the men if they would issue a tornado forecast based on the similarities between the conditions that produced the tornado which hit the base five days earlier  which they were reluctant to do  fawbush wrote the forecast message that miller would type and issued it to base operations at 2:50  p m  as thunderstorms were approaching from north texas  defying the high odds of two tornadoes hitting the same area in five days  one hit the tinker campus around 6:00  p m   to the surprise of miller  who left the base an hour earlier  believing their forecast would not pan out   who found out about the storm  produced by two thunderstorms that merged to the southwest of tinker  via a radio report  miller and fawbush would not put out another tornado forecast until march 25,  1949,  when they successfully predicted tornadic activity would occur in southeastern and fawbush soon would distribute their tornado forecasts to the american red cross and oklahoma highway patrol  after giving william maughan  chief meteorologist at the u s  weather bureau s oklahoma city office  who provided them with additional archived weather data to help fine-tune  their forecasts   permission to relay their forecasts to those agencies  the relative accuracy of the forecasts restarted a debate over their reliability and whether military or civilian agencies should have jurisdiction over the issuance of weather the usaf had pioneered tornado forecasting and tornado warnings  although john p  finley had developed the first experimental tornado forecasts in 1885,  before he and other officials with the agency were prohibited by the united states signal service s weather service from using the word  tornado  in forecasts two years later  directing finley to instead reference  severe local storms   a move motivated by concerns by businessmen in the great plains that finley s forecasts would hurt economic development if potential investors believed their areas were tornado-prone.  this position on tornado forecasting would be shared with the u s  weather bureau after it was formation in 1890,  fearing that it would incite panic among the public if tornadoes were predicted to occur  the side effect of this was that the lack of warning resulted in a steady increase in the number of tornado-related  fatalities through the 1950s,  with some events prior to 1948   such as the deadliest tornado in u s  history  the tri-state  tornado in march 1925,  and the glazier–higgins–woodward tornadoes in april 1947)  having death tolls that exceeded well over 1938,  the weather bureau rescinded its ban on the usage of the word  tornado  in weather products disseminated to emergency management personnel  the bureau would develop a network of volunteer storm spotters in the early 1940s  during world war ii  to provide warning of tornadoes to workers in munitions plants and strategic the ban on issuing tornado warnings to the general public would not be revoked until chief of bureau francis w  reichelderfer officially lifted the ban in a circular letter issued on july 12,  1950  to all first order stations   weather bureau employees should avoid statements that can be interpreted as a negation of the bureau s willingness or ability to make tornado forecasts   and that a  good probability of verification  exist when issuing such forecasts due to the difficulty in accurately predicting tornadic the american meteorological society agreed to have miller and fawbush present their methodology for forecasting tornadoes during the organization s 1950  meeting in st  louis  after garnering press coverage for their successful prediction of past tornadoes  ams representatives decided to open the presentation to the air force began issuing severe weather forecasts relayed to weather bureau offices and emergency personnel in tornado-prone  regions through the formation of the severe weather warning center in 1951,  before the bureau s contention that the usaf intruded on its responsibility to relay such forecasts led to the swwc limiting the release of its tornado forecasts to military personnel  however  the move to prohibit the usaf from widespread releasing of tornado forecasts led to disapproval and heavy criticism from oklahoma media outlets  given the agency s continued refusal to provide public tornado warnings  the weather bureau issued its first experimental public tornado forecast in march 1952,  which proved inaccurate and was released too late to become widely available for public consumption  however  a forecast issued the following evening managed to predict an outbreak of tornadoes across most of the warned seven-state  area  from texas to after the u s  weather bureau lifted their ban on tornado warnings  the federal communications commission continued to ban television and radio outlets from broadcasting tornado warnings on-air  for the same reasoning cited in the bureau s abolished ban  broadcast media followed this ban until 1954,  when meteorologist harry volkman broadcast the first televised tornado warning over wky-tv   now kfor-tv)  in oklahoma city  due to his belief that the banning of tornado warnings over broadcast media cost lives  through an alert issued by the usaf severe weather warning center  volkman opted to interrupt regular programming to warn viewers of a reported tornado approaching the oklahoma city area  although station management and u s  weather bureau officials were displeased with his move  wky-tv  received numerous telephone calls and letters thanking volkman for the many years until the early 1980s,  an intermediate type of tornado advisory known as a tornado alert was defined by the national weather service and issued by the agency s local forecast offices  indicating that tornado formation was imminent  in theory  tornado alerts covered situations such as visible rotation in clouds and certain other phenomena which are portents of funnel cloud formation  the national weather service s use of this advisory began to decline after 1974,  although it was still listed on public information materials issued by various media outlets  local nws offices and other entities for another decade or so the criteria which called for tornado alerts in the past now generally result in a tornado warning with clarifying verbiage specifying that the warning was issued because rotation was detected in one way or another  that a wall cloud has formed or a tornado has been spotted or detected  the preferred response to both the tornado alerts and warnings is to take shelter immediately  so distinguishing them could be seen as splitting hairs  especially since storm prediction methods have improved the tornado alert was finally eliminated outright because it was made largely obsolete by the advent of doppler weather radar  which can detect rotational funnel cloud formations earlier than is typically possible by trained spotters and members of the public  with fewer false-positives,  radar also helped reduce public confusion over storm types  strengths and precise locations  the last tornado alert to be officially issued was discussed in earnest following the 1974  super outbreak the national weather service has the option of issuing a tornado emergency  a severe weather statement with unofficial  enhanced wording that is disseminated when a large  extremely violent tornado is about to impact a densely populated area  this category of weather statement is the highest and most urgent level relating to tornadoes  albeit an unofficial alert product  the first tornado emergency was declared on may 3,  1999,  when an f5  tornado struck southern portions of the oklahoma city metropolitan area  causing major damage exceeding $1  billion  in some cases  such as an f3  tornado that struck the indianapolis  indiana metropolitan area on september 20,  2002,  a tornado emergency has been declared within the initial issuance of the tornado warning  not all confirmed tornadoes will be considered a  tornado emergency   and such statements are commonly declared when it is believed that the tornado is at a severity in which it would cause a significant threat to life and property the levels of severity increase as follows tornado warnings can also be intensified by added wording mentioning that the storm is life-threatening,  that it is an extremely dangerous situation  that a large  violent and or destructive tornado is on the ground or is capable of causing significant property damage a tornado warning is issued when any of the following conditions has occurred a tornado warning means there is immediate danger for the warned area and immediate surrounding locations – if not from the relatively narrow tornado itself  from the severe thunderstorm producing  or likely to produce  it  those in the path of such a storm are urged to take cover immediately  as it is a life-threatening  situation  a warning is different from a tornado watch  issued in the united states by a national guidance center  the storm prediction center  which only indicates that conditions are favorable for the formation of tornadoes generally  but not always   a tornado warning also indicates that the potential is there for severe straight-line  winds and or large hail  in the united states  winds exceeding 58  miles per hour (93  km h  and hail larger than 1  inch (2.5  cm  are the respective defined criteria to classify such phenomena as severe  the criteria varies in other countries  from the a severe thunderstorm warning can be upgraded suddenly to a tornado warning should conditions the united states  local offices of the national weather service outline warnings for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in polygonal shapes for map-based  weather hazard products  which are used to delineate sections of a county  parish or other jurisdiction that the warning covers  which are also referenced in nws text warning products by the specified sections of the affected jurisdictions   based on the projected path of a storm as determined by doppler radar at the time of the warning s issuance  however  entire counties parishes are sometimes included in the warning polygon  especially if they encompass a small geographical area  prior to october 2007,  warnings were issued by the national weather service on a per-county  storm prediction center and national weather service products as well as severe weather alert displays used by some television stations highlight tornado warnings with a red polygon or filled county parish outline in canada  similar criteria are used and warnings are issued by regional offices of the meteorological service of canada branch of environment canada in vancouver  edmonton  winnipeg  toronto  montreal and  in the province of ontario  emergency management ontario began issuing red alerts for areas of the province that are already under an environment canada-issued  tornado warning  these red alerts sometimes override the tornado warning if local government or media are participating in the program  tornado warnings are generated via the advance weather interactive processing system  awips  and then disseminated through various communication routes accessed by the media and various agencies  on the internet  to noaa satellites  and on noaa weather tornado sirens are also usually activated for the affected areas if present  the actual areas where sirens are activated may vary depending on the relay structure of a given jurisdiction s siren network  with some municipalities activating all sirens within their network even in areas not referenced as being included in the warning   local police or fire departments may dispatch crews not assigned to an existing emergency call to travel within a designated area to warn residents to take tornado safety precautions if sirens are disabled due to technical problems or are not present  while automated phone calls may be made to residents for the same purpose in some areas should such disruptions additionally  if it is deemed necessary  the national weather service has the option of requesting activation of the emergency alert system to interrupt television and radio broadcasts to get the bulletin out quickly advances in technology  both in identifying conditions and in distributing warnings effectively  have been credited with reducing the death toll from tornadoes  the average warning times have increased substantially from -10  to -15  minutes in 1974  to about 15  minutes as of  in some cases  the lead time can extend to more than an hour s warning of impending tornadoes   in the united states  the tornado death rate has declined from 1.8  deaths per million people per year in 1925  to only 0.11  per million in much of this change is credited to improvements in the tornado warning system  via the various advances in the detection of severe local storms  along with an increase in reports visually confirming severe weather activity via storm spotters  public officials and needed the skywarn program  which trains citizens on how to spot tornadoes  funnel clouds  wall clouds  and other severe weather phenomena  is offered by the national weather used in tandem with doppler radar information  eyewitness reports can be very helpful for warning the public of an impending tornado  especially when used for ground spotter groups such as the amateur radio emergency service  news media  local law enforcement agencies emergency management organizations  cooperative observers  and the general public also relay information to the national weather service for ground is an example of a tornado warning issued by the national weather service office in norman  oklahoma  using the new experimental impact based warning  ibw  is an example of an environment canada-issued  tornado warning for southeastern saskatchewan
