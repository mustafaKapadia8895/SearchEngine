 in the indian ocean north of the equator  tropical cyclones can form throughout the year on either side of india  on the east side is the bay of bengal  and on the west side is the arabian sea the bay of bengal  located in the northeast of the indian ocean  is responsible for the formation of some of the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclones in the world  the basin is abbreviated bob by the india meteorological department  imd   the official regional specialized meteorological center of the basin  the bay of bengal s coast is shared among india  bangladesh  myanmar  sri lanka and western part of thailand  the strongest storm in the bay was the 1999  odisha cyclone  as the remnants impact tibet and yunnan sometimes  the national meteorological center of cma also issues full advisories to cyclonic storms in this arabian sea is a sea located in the northwest of the indian ocean  tropical cyclones in the basin are abbreviated arb by the india meteorological department  imd   the official regional specialized meteorological centre  rsmc  of the basin  the arabian sea s coast is shared among india  yemen  oman  iran  pakistan  sri lanka  maldives and monsoons are characteristic of the arabian sea and responsible for the yearly cycling of its waters  in summer  strong winds blow from the southwest to the northeast  bringing rain to the indian subcontinent  during the winter  the winds are milder and blow in the opposite direction  from the northeast to the cyclones are rare in the arabian sea  but the basin can produce strong tropical cyclones  super cyclonic storm gonu was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the however  storms typically do not reach a high intensity in the arabian sea due to the small amount of water  dry air coming from the desert of the arabian peninsula  and unfavorable wind shear from the systematic scientific studies of tropical systems in the bay of bengal and arabian sea was started during the 19th  century by henry piddington utilised meteorological logs of vessels that navigated the seas and published a series of memoirs  in the “journal of the asiatic society of bengal” between 1839  and these memoirs gave accounts and tracks of individual storms in the bay of bengal and the arabian the 2004  post monsoon season the imd started to name tropical cyclones within the basin  with the first one named cyclone onil during september 2015  a modification to the intensity scale took place  with the imd and wmo calling a system with 3-minute  maximum sustained wind speeds between 90  knots (165  km h  105  mph  and 120  knots (220  km h  140  mph  an extremely severe cyclonic temperatures in the arabian sea are typically warm enough to allow for tropical cyclogenesis year round  although strong wind shear from the monsoon trough prevents formation in the summer months and limits intensity other times of the year  an increase in air pollution since the 1930s  caused a decrease in the wind shear  allowing storms to have become stronger since study analyzing the spring season of tropical cyclones in the bay of found increases in both premonsoon precipitation and tropical cyclone intensity as a result of enhanced large-scale  monsoon circulation after 1979.  the deepened monsoon trough in the bay of bengal not only affects cyclone frequency and timing  but also acts to direct more cyclones towards myanmar  increased anthropogenic aerosols likely contributed to such a regional climate change
