 hurricane patricia was the second-most  intense tropical cyclone on record worldwide  behind typhoon tip in 1979,  with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 872  mbar  hpa  25.75  originating from a sprawling disturbance near the gulf of tehuantepec  south of mexico  in mid-october  2015,  patricia was first classified a tropical depression on october 20.  initial development was slow  with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification  the system later became a tropical storm and was named patricia  the twenty-fourth  named storm of the annual hurricane season  exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on october 22.  a well-defined  eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and patricia grew from a tropical storm to a category 5  hurricane in just 24  hours—a near-record  pace  on october 23,  the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 215  mph (345  2]  this made it the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the western hemisphere  and the strongest globally in terms of 1-minute  maximum sustained winds late on october 23,  dramatic weakening ensued and patricia made landfall near cuixmala  jalisco  with winds of 150  mph (240  km h   this made it the strongest landfalling hurricane on record along the pacific coast of mexico  patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly  faster than it had intensified  as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of mexico  within 24  hours of moving ashore  patricia weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter  late on october 24.the  precursor to patricia produced widespread flooding rains in central america  hundreds of thousands of people were directly affected by the storm  mostly in guatemala  at least six fatalities were attributed to the event  four in el salvador  one in guatemala  and one in nicaragua  torrential rains extended into southeastern mexico  with areas of quintana roo and veracruz reporting accumulations in excess of 19.7  in (500  mm   damage in chetumal reached 1.4  billion pesos (us$84.1  3]as  a tropical cyclone  patricia s effects in mexico were tremendous  however  the affected areas were predominantly rural  mitigating a potential large-scale  disaster  violent winds tore roofs from structures and stripped coastal areas of their vegetation  preliminary assessments indicated hundreds of homes to be destroyed  seven fatalities were linked to the hurricane directly or indirectly  including one during evacuations  total damage was estimated to be in excess of 5.4  billion pesos (us$323.3  million   with agriculture and infrastructure comprising the majority of losses  flooding partially associated with remnant moisture from patricia inflicted us$52.5  million in damage across southern texas on october 11,  2015,  an area of disturbed weather traversed central america and emerged over the eastern pacific ocean  the disturbance moved slowly over the next few days  later merging with a tropical wave on october 15.  the merger of these systems and the effects of a concurrent tehuantepec gap wind event spurred the formation of a broad area of low pressure  this feature gradually consolidated and became a tropical depression shortly after 00:00  utc on october 20;  at this time the depression was situated roughly 205  mi (335  km  south-southeast  of salina cruz  mexico  a mid-level  ridge to the north steered the depression generally west and later pulled it north along an arcing was initially slowed by locally cooler sea surface temperatures and dry air  and the depression became tropical storm patricia later that once clear of the unfavorable region  patricia traversed anomalously warm waters within an environment exceptionally conducive to rapid dramatic strengthening began late on october 21  and continued through october 23.  patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00:00  utc on october featuring prominent outflow  well-defined  banding and a developing data from hurricane hunters investigating the cyclone indicated patricia to have reached category 4  status on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale by 18:00  the early hours of october 23,  a clear northward turn took place followed by acceleration a solid ring of −130  °f (−90  °c  cloud tops surrounded the hurricane s 12  mi (19  km  wide eye and signaled its intensification into a category 5  hurricane  in a 24-hour  time span  patricia s maximum sustained winds increased by 120  mph (195  km h   the fastest such intensification in any hurricane observed by the national hurricane center  nhc   the hurricane achieved its peak around 12:00  utc on october 23,  with estimated winds around 215  mph (345  km h  and a barometric pressure of 872  mbar  hpa  25.75  inhg   these values are based upon continued intensification after a hurricane hunter mission into the storm six hours prior  in the nhc s report on patricia  it is noted that the hurricane may have surpassed typhoon tip as the strongest tropical cyclone ever observed  but lack of direct observations at the time of its peak prevent analysis of on october 23,  rapid weakening ensued as an eyewall replacement cycle took shape and wind shear increased  in the five hours up until landfall in mexico  patricia weakened at an unprecedented rate while still over water  however  it remained a violent hurricane and moved ashore around 23:00  utc near cuixmala  jalisco  with winds of 150  mph (240  km h  and an analyzed pressure of 932  mbar  hpa  27.49  inhg   this made it the most intense pacific hurricane on record to strike mexico  once onshore  the high terrain of the sierra madre mountains accelerated patricia s weakening  the low-  and mid-level  circulations of the tropical cyclone decoupled  with the latter accelerating northeast  and patricia dissipated on october 24  over central mexico  less than 18  hours after moving patricia set multiple records for maximum strength  rate of intensification  and rate of weakening throughout its relatively short existence  with maximum sustained winds of 215  mph (345  km h  and a minimum pressure of 872  mbar  hpa  25.75  inhg   patricia is the most intense tropical cyclone ever observed in the western hemisphere  in terms of central pressure  it is also the second-most  intense tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide  just shy of typhoon tip in 1979  which had a minimum pressure of 870  mbar  hpa  25.69  patricia s one-minute  maximum sustained winds ranked as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated in a tropical cyclone  surpassing typhoon haiyan of the magnitude of patricia s rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed  in a 24-hour  period  06:00–06:00  utc october 22–23,  its maximum sustained winds increased from 85  mph (140  km h  to 205  mph (335  km h   a record increase of 120  mph (195  km h   during the same period  patricia s central pressure fell by 95  mbar  hpa  2.81  inhg   despite record over-water  weakening prior to striking mexico  patricia became the most intense pacific hurricane to make landfall  with a pressure of 932  mbar  hpa  27.52  hurricane patricia arrived  the government of mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for coastal communities  a hurricane watch was first raised at 09:00  utc on october 21,  encompassing areas of michoacán  colima  and jalisco  a tropical storm watch also covered portions of guerrero  as patricia intensified  the government issued a hurricane warning for areas between cabo corrientes  jalisco  and punta san telmo  michoacán  a tropical storm warning supplemented this for areas farther north and east  the hurricane warning was extended northward to include areas south of san blas  nayarit  on october 23.  once the storm moved inland and the threat of damaging winds diminished  these warnings were gradually discontinued on october patricia s upgrade to category 5  status  the national hurricane center called the storm  potentially a source of criticism and praise from various citing the relatively limited damage and loss of life  some outlets  including the associated claimed the agency was exaggerating the danger posed by the storm  however  most outlets praised them for effectively communicating the dire threat and potentially saving lives from an exceptionally powerful michoacán  colima  jalisco  and nayarit  1,782  shelters were opened on october 22  with a collective capacity
