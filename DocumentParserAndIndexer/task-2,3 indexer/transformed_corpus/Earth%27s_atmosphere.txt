 the atmosphere of earth is the layer of gases  commonly known as air  that surrounds the planet earth and is retained by earth s gravity  the atmosphere of earth protects life on earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the earth s surface  absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation  warming the surface through heat retention  greenhouse effect   and reducing temperature extremes between day and night  the diurnal temperature variation  by volume  dry air contains 78.09%  nitrogen  20.95%  0.93%  argon  0.04%  carbon dioxide  and small amounts of other gases  air also contains a variable amount of water vapor  on average around 1%  at sea level  and 0.4%  over the entire atmosphere  air content and atmospheric pressure vary at different layers  and air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in earth s troposphere and in artificial atmospheres the atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15×1018  three quarters of which is within about 11  km (6.8  mi  36,000  ft  of the surface  the atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude  with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space  the kármán line  at 100  km (62  mi   or 1.57%  of earth s radius  is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space  atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around 120  km (75  mi   several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere  based on characteristics such as temperature and composition the study of earth s atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science  aerology   early pioneers in the field include léon teisserenc de bort and richard three major constituents of air  and therefore of earth s atmosphere  are nitrogen  oxygen  and argon  water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25%  of the atmosphere by mass  the concentration of water vapor  a greenhouse gas  varies significantly from around 10  ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5%  by volume in hot  humid air masses  and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air  without water the remaining gases are often referred to as trace among which are the greenhouse gases  principally carbon dioxide  methane  nitrous oxide  and ozone  filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds  many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample  including dust of mineral and organic composition  pollen and spores  sea spray  and volcanic ash  various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols  such as chlorine  elemental or in compounds   fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor  sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide (so2)  may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution  a  volume fraction is equal to mole fraction for ideal gas only  also see volume  thermodynamics   b  ppmv  parts per million by volume  c  water vapor is about 0.25%  by mass over full atmosphere  d  water vapor strongly varies relative concentration of gasses remains constant until about 10,000  m (33,000  general  air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere  however  temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude  and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions  see the temperature section  below   because the general pattern of the temperature altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of instrumented balloon soundings  the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers  in this way  earth s atmosphere can be divided  called atmospheric stratification  into five main layers  excluding the exosphere  the atmosphere has four primary layers  which are the troposphere  stratosphere  mesosphere  and from highest to lowest  the five main layers are the exosphere is the outermost layer of earth s atmosphere  i e  the upper limit of the atmosphere   it extends from the exobase  which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700  km above sea level  to about 10,000  km (6,200  mi  33,000,000  ft  where it merges into the solar wind this layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen  helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen  oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase  the atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another  thus  the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas  and the particles constantly escape into space  these free-moving  particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind the exosphere is located too far above earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible  however  the aurora borealis and aurora australis sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere  where they overlap into the thermosphere  the exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting earth the thermosphere is the second-highest  layer of earth s atmosphere  it extends from the mesopause  which separates it from the mesosphere  at an altitude of about 80  km (50  mi  260,000  ft  up to the thermopause at an altitude range of 500–1000  km (310–620  mi  1,600,000–3,300,000  ft   the height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere  it is also referred to as the exobase  the lower part of the thermosphere  from 80  to 550  kilometres (50  to 342  mi  above earth s surface  contains the ionosphere the temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height  unlike the stratosphere beneath it  wherein a temperature inversion is due to the absorption of radiation by ozone  the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules  the temperature of this layer can rise as high as 1500  °c (2700  °f   though the gas molecules are so far apart that its temperature in the usual sense is not very meaningful  the air is so rarefied that an individual molecule  of oxygen  for example  travels an average of 1  kilometre (0.62  mi  3300  ft  between collisions with other although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy  it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact  because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin this layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor  however  non-hydrometeorological  phenomena such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis are occasionally seen in the thermosphere  the international space station orbits in this layer  between 350  and 420  km (220  and 260  mi  the mesosphere is the third highest layer of earth s atmosphere  occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere  it extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about 50  km (31  mi  160,000  ft  to the mesopause at 80–85  km (50–53  mi  260,000–280,000  ft  above sea level temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere  it is the coldest place on earth and has an average temperature around −85  °c (−120  °f  190  below the mesopause  the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar-mesospheric  noctilucent clouds  these are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise  they are most readily visible when the sun is around 4  to 16  degrees below the horizon  a type of lightning referred to as either sprites or elves occasionally forms far above tropospheric thunderclouds  the mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance  it is too high above earth to be accessible to jet-powered  aircraft and balloons  and too low to permit orbital spacecraft  the mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocket-powered  aircraft the stratosphere is the second-lowest  layer of earth s atmosphere  it lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause  this layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly 12  km (7.5  mi  39,000  ft  above earth s surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about 50  to 55  km (31  to 34  mi  164,000  to 180,000  ft  the atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000  the pressure at sea level  it contains the ozone layer  which is the part of earth s atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas  the stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude  this rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation  uv  radiation from the sun by the ozone layer  which restricts turbulence and mixing  although the temperature may be −60  °c (−76  °f  210  k  at the tropopause  the top of the stratosphere is much warmer  and may be near 0  stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions  so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing  air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere  consequently  the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather  however  polar stratospheric or nacreous clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest  the stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered  aircraft the troposphere is the lowest layer of earth s atmosphere  it extends from earth s surface to an average height of about 12  km  although this altitude actually varies from about 9  km (30,000  ft  at the poles to 17  km (56,000  ft  at the with some variation due to weather  the troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause  a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion  i e  a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one   and in others by a zone which is isothermal with variations do occur  the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface  thus  the lowest part of the troposphere  i e  earth s surface  is typically the warmest section of the troposphere  this promotes vertical mixing  hence the origin of its name in the greek word τρόπος  tropos  meaning  turn    the troposphere contains roughly 80%  of the mass of earth s the troposphere is denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed  fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower 5.6  km (18,000  ft  of the troposphere nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere  so it is the layer where most of earth s weather takes place  it has basically all the weather-associated  cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation  although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere  most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere  and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven  aircraft within the five principal layers that are largely determined by temperature  several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties the average temperature of the atmosphere at earth s surface is 14  °c (57  °f  287  or 15  °c (59  °f  288  depending on the average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the international standard atmosphere as 101325  pascals (760.00  torr  14.6959  psi  760.00  mmhg   this is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard atmospheres  atm   total atmospheric mass is 5.1480×1018  kg (1.135×1019  about 2.5%  less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and earth s area of 51007.2  megahectares  this portion being displaced by earth s mountainous terrain  atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured  thus air pressure varies with location and weather if the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density from sea level  it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of 8.50  km (27,900  ft   it actually decreases exponentially with altitude  dropping by half every 5.6  km (18,000  ft  or by a factor of 1/e  every 7.64  km (25,100  ft   the average scale height of the atmosphere below 70  km (43  mi  230,000  ft   however  the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature  molecular composition  solar radiation and gravity into account in summary  the mass of earth s atmosphere is distributed approximately as comparison  the summit of mt  everest is at 8,848  m (29,029  ft   commercial airliners typically cruise between 10  km (33,000  ft  and 13  km (43,000  ft  where the thinner air improves fuel economy  weather balloons reach 30.4  km (100,000  ft  and above  and the highest x-15  flight in 1963  reached 108.0  km (354,300  ft  even above the kármán line  significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur  meteors begin to glow in this region  though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply  the various layers of earth s ionosphere  important to hf radio propagation  begin below 100  km and extend beyond 500  km  by comparison  the international space station and space shuttle typically orbit at 350–400  km  within the f-layer  of the ionosphere where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months  depending on solar activity  satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700–800  km the division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above  temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level  but variations in this trend begin above 11  km  where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere  in the stratosphere  starting above about 20  km  the temperature increases with height  due to heating within the ozone layer caused by capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region  still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes  in the aptly-named  thermosphere above 90  km because in an ideal gas of constant composition the speed of sound depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density  the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile  see illustration to the right   and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure the density of air at sea level is about 1.2  kg/m3  (1.2  g l  0.0012  g/cm3).  density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature  pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air  a form of the ideal gas law   atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases  this variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula  more sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites the average mass of the atmosphere is about 5  quadrillion (5×1015)  tonnes or 1/1,200,000  the mass of earth  according to the american national center for atmospheric research   the total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480×1018  kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2  or 1.5×1015  kg  depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used  somewhat smaller than the previous estimate  the mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27×1016  kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352  ±0.0003×1018  kg  solar radiation  or sunlight  is the energy earth receives from the sun  earth also emits radiation back into space  but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see  part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere  in may 2017,  glints of light  seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away  were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the light passes through earth s atmosphere  photons interact with it through scattering  if the light does not interact with the atmosphere  it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the sun  indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere  for example  on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you  it has all been scattered  as another example  due to a phenomenon called rayleigh scattering  shorter  blue  wavelengths scatter more easily than longer  red  wavelengths  this is why the sky looks blue  you are seeing scattered blue light  this is also why sunsets are red  because the sun is close to the horizon  the sun s rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye  much of the blue light has been scattered out  leaving the red light in a sunset different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation  for example  o2  and o3  absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300  nanometers  water (h2o)  absorbs many wavelengths above 700  nm  when a molecule absorbs a photon  it increases the energy of the molecule  this heats the atmosphere  but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation  as discussed below the combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave  windows  of low opacity  allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light  the optical window runs from around 300  nm (ultraviolet-c)  up into the range humans can see  the visible spectrum  commonly called light   at roughly 400–700  nm and continues to the infrared to around 1100  nm  there are also infrared and radio windows that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths  for example  the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter  waves emission is the opposite of absorption  it is when an object emits radiation  objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their  black body  emission curves  therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation  with shorter wavelengths  colder objects emit less radiation  with longer wavelengths  for example  the sun is approximately 6,000  k (5,730  °c  10,340  °f   its radiation peaks near 500  nm  and is visible to the human eye  earth is approximately 290  k (17  °c  62  °f   so its radiation peaks near 10,000  nm  and is much too long to be visible to humans because of its temperature  the atmosphere emits infrared radiation  for example  on clear nights earth s surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights  this is because clouds (h2o)  are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation  this is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations the greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission effect  some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation  but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum  common examples of these are co2  and h2o.the  refractive index of air is close to  but just greater than 1.  systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths  one example is that  under some circumstances  observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of earth s surface the refractive index of air depends on temperature  giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large  an example of such effects is the mirage atmospheric circulation is the large-scale  movement of air through the troposphere  and the means  with ocean circulation  by which heat is distributed around earth  the large-scale  structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year  but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by earth s rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles the first atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula  primarily hydrogen  there were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants  jupiter and saturn   notably water vapor  methane and ammonia  as the solar nebula dissipated  these gases escaped  partly driven off by the solar from volcanism  supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of earth by huge asteroids  produced the next atmosphere  consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide and inert a major part of carbon-dioxide  emissions soon dissolved in water and built up carbonate needed researchers have found water-related  sediments dating from as early as 3.8  billion years about 3.4  billion years ago  nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable  second atmosphere   an influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere  because hints of early life-forms  appear as early as 3.5  billion years how earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life  if the early sun put out 30%  lower solar radiance than today  is a puzzle known as the  faint young sun paradox  the geological record however shows a continually relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of earth -  with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4  billion years ago  in the late archean eon an oxygen-containing  atmosphere began to develop  apparently produced by photosynthesizing cyanobacteria  see great oxygenation event   which have been found as stromatolite fossils from 2.7  billion years ago  the early basic carbon isotopy  isotope ratio proportions  strongly suggests conditions similar to the current  and that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle became established as early as 4  billion years ago ancient sediments in the gabon dating from between about 2,150  and 2,080  million years ago provide a record of earth s dynamic oxygenation evolution  these fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the lomagundi carbon isotope constant re-arrangement  of continents by plate tectonics influences the long-term  evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores  free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4  billion years ago during the great oxygenation event and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded iron formations before this time  any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials  notably iron  molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen  this point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere  o2  showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15%  by the end of the the following time span from 541  million years ago to the present day is the phanerozoic eon  during the earliest period of which  the cambrian  oxygen-requiring  metazoan life forms began to appear the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600  million years  reaching a peak of about 30%  around 280  million years ago  significantly higher than today s 21%.  two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere  plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  releasing oxygen  breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere  which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere  however  volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide  which plants can convert to oxygen  the exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known  periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals  today s atmosphere contains 21%  oxygen  which is high enough for this rapid development of scientific consensus is that the anthropogenic greenhouse gases currently accumulating in the atmosphere are the main cause of global pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals  particulate matter or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to stratospheric ozone depletion is caused by air pollution  chiefly from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting  substances on october 19,  2015  nasa started a website containing daily images of the full sunlit side of earth on http   epic gsfc nasa gov   the images are taken from the deep space climate observatory  dscovr  and show earth as it rotates during a
