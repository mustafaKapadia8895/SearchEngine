 the lamont–doherty earth observatory  ldeo  is a research unit of columbia university located on a 157-acre  (64  ha  campus in palisades  n y   18  miles (29  km  north of manhattan on the hudson river the lamont–doherty earth observatory  ldeo  was established in 1949  as the lamont geological observatory on the weekend estate of thomas w  and florence haskell corliss lamont  which was donated to the university for that the observatory’s founder and first director was maurice  doc  ewing  a seismologist who is credited with advancing efforts to study the solid earth  particularly in areas related to using sound waves to image rock and sediments beneath the ocean he was also the first to collect sediment core samples from the bottom of the a common practice today that helps scientists study changes in the planet s climate and the ocean s thermohaline circulation in 1969,  the observatory was renamed lamont–doherty in honor of a major gift from the henry l  and grace doherty charitable foundation  in 1993,  it was renamed the lamont–doherty earth observatory in recognition of its expertise in the broad range of earth sciences  lamont–doherty earth observatory is columbia university s earth sciences research center and is a core component of the earth institute  a collection of academic and research units within the university that together address complex environmental issues facing the planet and its inhabitants  with particular focus on advancing scientific research to support sustainable development and the needs of the world s support its research and the work of the broader scientific community  lamont–doherty operates the 235-foot  (72  m  research vessel  the r v marcus langseth  which is equipped to undertake a wide range of geological  seismological  oceanographic and biological studies  lamont–doherty also houses the world s largest collection of deep-sea  and ocean-sediment  cores as well as many specialized research laboratories the lamont–doherty earth observatory at columbia university is one of the world’s leading research centers developing fundamental knowledge about the origin  evolution and future of the natural world  more than 300  research scientists and students study the planet from its deepest interior to the outer reaches of its atmosphere  on every continent and in every ocean  from global climate change to earthquakes  volcanoes  nonrenewable resources  environmental hazards and beyond  observatory scientists provide a rational basis for the difficult choices facing humankind in the planet’s stewardship among the many contributions lamont–doherty scientists have made to understanding of the earth system over the years  they the division of biology and paleo environment  bpe  includes oceanographers  geologists  geochemists  biologists and environmental scientists who pursue research in two connected efforts  first  because all biological organisms record the environment in which they exist  bpe scientists use biology to uncover clues about earth’s past environment  they also attempt to understand how modern environmental conditions affect present-day  biology  to do this  bpe scientists turn to a number of primary sources  including deep-sea  sediment cores  and the fossils of phytoplankton and zooplankton they contain   samples from coral reefs  and growth rings of trees researchers in the division of geochemistry study the processes  past and present  that have governed earth’s many environments  using chemical and isotopic analyses  division scientists study samples of air  water  biological remains  rocks and meteorites in order to address a broad range of scientific issues  ranging from the particulate and chemical pollutants emitted by the collapse of the world trade center  to changes in earth s past climate  to the fundamental chemical processes involved in the differentiation and formation of the planet s mantle and core as its name implies  scientists in the division of marine geology and geophysics  mg g  are primarily concerned with studying the structure and evolution of the earth s seafloor  to do so  they employ tools that include side-scan  sonar and multi-channel  seismic imaging to map the surface and sub-surface,  as well as satellite-based  remote sensing  an early success of mg g researchers was the discovery of seafloor spreading  which led to the general acceptance of plate tectonics as the broad foundation for understanding earthquake generation  other mg g scientists study the interface between ice sheets and bedrock  sediment transport in the hudson river  and meteorite impacts in the deep ocean the division of ocean and climate physics  ocp  focuses on the links between earth’s climate system and its oceans  including interactions involving the atmosphere  ocean circulation  planetary volcanism  the cryosphere  the biosphere and external forces such as variability of solar radiation and even the occasional asteroid impact  scientists are also increasingly interested in understanding the nature of past and present changes to earth’s climate—whether abrupt or gradual  regional or global—and the potential for human activities to influence the natural system the researchers in the seismology  geology and tectonophysics division  sgt  study theoretical and observational seismology  solid earth dynamics  rock mechanics  structural geology and tectonics  and sedimentary geology  they also contribute to understanding of earthquakes  the structure of earth’s crust  mantle  and core  and the large-scale  motions and deformation of the tectonic plates  in addition  the division operates several facilities for the scientific community  in partnership with the u s  geological survey  sgt operates a network of seismographs throughout the northeastern u s   supports national science foundation  nsf  efforts to conduct ocean-bottom  seismology research  and provides accurate earthquake source mechanisms to government and academic researchers around the world the history of lamont–doherty s seagoing research began in 1953  with the acquisition of the r v vema and the formation of a group within the observatory to organize and support research missions  today  the office of marine operations oversees geophysical and oceanographic studies on board the observatory s latest research vessel  the r v marcus langseth  and conducts its own research on the character and operation of various geophysical imaging systems employed by the scientific community the department of earth and environmental sciences  dees  is the educational arm of columbia university located on the lamont–doherty campus to train graduate and undergraduate students enrolled at the university and at barnard college  the lamont–doherty office of dees primarily supports the department s graduate program  though many undergraduate students take classes and conduct research at the observatory  at any given time  between 80  and 90  ph d  students are working towards degrees in specialties that include aqueous geochemistry  atmospheric science  climate science  ecophysiology  geology  paleoclimatology  paleontology  physical oceanography  solid earth geophysics  and solid earth geochemistry  specific programs at lamont–doherty are conducted with many education-affiliates  at columbia and elsewhere in the new york metro area the lamont–doherty core repository is both an archive of sediment and rocks from on and beneath the ocean floor and an archive of digital data pertaining to the material  the repository contains more than 7,200  meters of core  from every ocean and sea  and many other samples  they are used to study earth s climate and environment  in other research areas  and for educational purposes the tree-ring  lab  trl  is dedicated to the application of tree-ring  research around the world to improve understanding of earth s past climate and environmental history  current research concentrates on the use of tree-ring  data networks to study regional climate  global climate teleconnections and anthropogenic impacts on tree growth  and on developing new quantitative techniques the ocean bottom seismology  obs  lab develops and operates instruments used to measure deformation of the ocean floor in cooperation with the nsf s national ocean bottom seismograph instrumentation pool  obsip   these instruments permit the study of such phenomena as seafloor spreading and the formation of new crust  convective and hydrothermal processes beneath the seafloor  and the fate of subducting slabs the lamont–doherty cooperative seismographic network  lcsn  operates 40  seismographic stations in seven states—connecticut  delaware  maryland  new jersey  new york  pennsylvania and vermont—to monitor earthquakes occurring primarily in the eastern u s  the network is an active member of the advanced national seismic system  anss   which is a key input to the usgs national seismic hazard maps  it also provides professional development among station operators lamont–doherty is home to a wide range of geophysical databases and repositories that aid in scientific research  education and outreach  many of the databases are available online  and the repositories of physical samples  which are open to access by researchers and students from around the world  also make an increasing portion of their holdings available digitally coordinates  41°00′14″n  73°54′25″w﻿    ﻿41.004°n  73.907°w﻿    41.004;  -73.907
