 in physics  a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy  frequency refers to the addition of time  wave motion transfers energy from one point to another  which displace particles of the transmission medium–that is  with little or no associated mass transport  waves consist  instead  of oscillations or vibrations  of a physical quantity   around almost fixed locations a wave is a disturbance that transfers energy through matter or space  there are two main types of waves  mechanical waves propagate through a medium  and the substance of this medium is deformed  restoring forces then reverse the deformation  for example  sound waves propagate via air molecules colliding with their neighbors  when the molecules collide  they also bounce away from each other  a restoring force   this keeps the molecules from continuing to travel in the direction of the wave the second main type  electromagnetic waves  do not require a medium  instead  they consist of periodic oscillations of electrical and magnetic fields originally generated by charged particles  and can therefore travel through a vacuum  these types vary in wavelength  and include radio waves  microwaves  infrared radiation  visible light  ultraviolet radiation  x-rays  and gamma rays waves are described by a wave equation which sets out how the disturbance proceeds over time  the mathematical form of this equation varies depending on the type of wave  further  the behavior of particles in quantum mechanics are described by waves  in addition  gravitational waves also travel through space  which are a result of a vibration or movement in gravitational fields a wave can be transverse  where a disturbance creates oscillations that are perpendicular to the propagation of energy transfer  or longitudinal  the oscillations are parallel to the direction of energy propagation  while mechanical waves can be both transverse and longitudinal  all electromagnetic waves are transverse in free space a single  all-encompassing  definition for the term wave is not straightforward  a vibration can be defined as a back-and-forth  motion around a reference value  however  a vibration is not necessarily a wave  an attempt to define the necessary and sufficient characteristics that qualify a phenomenon as a wave results in a blurred line the term wave is often intuitively understood as referring to a transport of spatial disturbances that are generally not accompanied by a motion of the medium occupying this space as a whole  in a wave  the energy of a vibration is moving away from the source in the form of a disturbance within the surrounding medium  hall 1980,  p  8).  however  this motion is problematic for a standing wave  for example  a wave on a string   where energy is moving in both directions equally  or for electromagnetic  e g   light  waves in a vacuum  where the concept of medium does not apply and interaction with a target is the key to wave detection and practical applications  there are water waves on the ocean surface  gamma waves and light waves emitted by the sun  microwaves used in microwave ovens and in radar equipment  radio waves broadcast by radio stations  and sound waves generated by radio receivers  telephone handsets and living creatures  as voices   to mention only a few wave phenomena it may appear that the description of waves is closely related to their physical origin for each specific instance of a wave process  for example  acoustics is distinguished from optics in that sound waves are related to a mechanical rather than an electromagnetic wave transfer caused by vibration  concepts such as mass  momentum  inertia  or elasticity  become therefore crucial in describing acoustic  as distinct from optic  wave processes  this difference in origin introduces certain wave characteristics particular to the properties of the medium involved  for example  in the case of air  vortices  radiation pressure  shock waves etc   in the case of solids  rayleigh waves  dispersion  and so on    other properties  however  although usually described in terms of origin  may be generalized to all waves  for such reasons  wave theory represents a particular branch of physics that is concerned with the properties of wave processes independently of their physical for example  based on the mechanical origin of acoustic waves  a moving disturbance in space–time can exist if and only if the medium involved is neither infinitely stiff nor infinitely pliable  if all the parts making up a medium were rigidly bound  then they would all vibrate as one  with no delay in the transmission of the vibration and therefore no wave motion  on the other hand  if all the parts were independent  then there would not be any transmission of the vibration and again  no wave motion  although the above statements are meaningless in the case of waves that do not require a medium  they reveal a characteristic that is relevant to all waves regardless of origin  within a wave  the phase of a vibration  that is  its position within the vibration cycle  is different for adjacent points in space because the vibration reaches these points at different times consider a traveling transverse wave  which may be a pulse  on a string  the medium   consider the string to have a single spatial dimension  consider this wave as travelingthis wave can then be described by the two-dimensional  functionsor  more generally  by d alembert s two component waveforms f   displaystyle f  and g   displaystyle g  traveling through the medium in opposite directions  a generalized representation of this wave can be as the partial differential equationgeneral solutions are based upon duhamel s form or shape of f in d alembert s formula involves the argument x − vt  constant values of this argument correspond to constant values of f  and these constant values occur if x increases at the same rate that vt increases  that is  the wave shaped like the function f will move in the positive x-direction  at velocity v  and g will propagate at the same speed in the negative the case of a periodic function f with period λ  that is  f x   λ − vt    f x − vt   the periodicity of f in space means that a snapshot of the wave at a given time t finds the wave varying periodically in space with period λ  the wavelength of the wave   in a similar fashion  this periodicity of f implies a periodicity in time as well  f x − v t   t     f x − vt  provided vt   λ  so an observation of the wave at a fixed location x finds the wave undulating periodically in time with period t   amplitude of a wave may be constant  in which case the wave is a c w  or continuous wave   or may be modulated so as to vary with time and or position  the outline of the variation in amplitude is called the envelope of the wave  mathematically  the modulated wave can be written in the a   x   t     displaystyle a x   t   is the amplitude envelope of the wave  k   displaystyle k  is the wavenumber and ϕ   displaystyle  phi   is the phase  if the group velocity v g   displaystyle v  g    see below  is wavelength-independent,  this equation can be simplified that the envelope moves with the group velocity and retains its shape  otherwise  in cases where the group velocity varies with wavelength  the pulse shape changes in a manner often described using an envelope are two velocities that are associated with waves  the phase velocity and the group velocity  to understand them  one must consider several types of waveform  for simplification  examination is restricted to one dimension the most basic wave  a form of plane wave  may be expressed in the form which can be related to the usual sine and cosine forms using euler s formula  rewriting the argument  k x − ω t     2  π λ     x − v t     displaystyle kx-\omega  t  left   frac {2\pi     lambda }}\right)(x-vt)}    makes clear that this expression describes a vibration of wavelength λ   2  π k   displaystyle  lambda    frac {2\pi    k    traveling in the x-direction  with a constant phase velocity v p   ω k   displaystyle v  p    frac   omega   k      other type of wave to be considered is one with localized structure described by an envelope  which may be expressed mathematically as  for example where now a(k1)   the integral is the inverse fourier transform of a(k1))  is a function exhibiting a sharp peak in a region of wave vectors δk surrounding the point k1    k  in exponential form with ao the magnitude of a  for example  a common choice for ao is a gaussian wave σ determines the spread of k1-values  about k  and n is the amplitude of the wave the exponential function inside the integral for ψ oscillates rapidly with its argument  say φ(k1),  and where it varies rapidly  the exponentials cancel each other out  interfere destructively  contributing little to however  an exception occurs at the location where the argument φ of the exponential varies slowly   this observation is the basis for the method of stationary phase for evaluation of such the condition for φ to vary slowly is that its rate of change with k1  be small  this rate of variation the evaluation is made at k1    k because a(k1)  is centered there  this result shows that the position x where the phase changes slowly  the position where ψ is appreciable  moves with time at a speed called the group velocity the group velocity therefore depends upon the dispersion relation connecting ω and k  for example  in quantum mechanics the energy of a particle represented as a wave packet is e   ħω   (ħk)2/(2m).  consequently  for that wave situation  the group velocity isshowing that the velocity of a localized particle in quantum mechanics is its group because the group velocity varies with k  the shape of the wave packet broadens with time  and the particle becomes less in other words  the velocity of the constituent waves of the wave packet travel at a rate that varies with their wavelength  so some move faster than others  and they cannot maintain the same interference pattern as the wave propagates mathematically  the most basic wave is the  spatially  one-dimensional  sine wave  or harmonic wave or sinusoid  with an amplitude u   displaystyle u  described by the equation wherethe units of the amplitude depend on the type of wave  transverse mechanical waves  e g   a wave on a string  have an amplitude expressed as a distance  e g   meters   longitudinal mechanical waves  e g   sound waves  use units of pressure  e g   pascals   and electromagnetic waves  a form of transverse vacuum wave  express the amplitude in terms of its electric field  e g   volts meter  the wavelength λ   displaystyle  lambda   is the distance between two sequential crests or troughs  or other equivalent points   generally is measured in meters  a wavenumber k   displaystyle k    the spatial frequency of the wave in radians per unit distance  typically per meter   can be associated with the wavelength by the relationthe period t   displaystyle t  is the time for one complete cycle of an oscillation of a wave  the frequency f   displaystyle f  is the number of periods per unit time  per second  and is typically measured in hertz denoted as hz  these are related by in other words  the frequency and period of a wave are reciprocals the angular frequency ω   displaystyle  omega   represents the frequency in radians per second  it is related to the frequency or period bythe wavelength λ   displaystyle  lambda   of a sinusoidal waveform traveling at constant speed v   displaystyle v  is given v   displaystyle v  is called the phase speed  magnitude of the phase velocity  of the wave and f   displaystyle f  is the wave s frequency wavelength can be a useful concept even if the wave is not periodic in space  for example  in an ocean wave approaching shore  the incoming wave undulates with a varying local wavelength that depends in part on the depth of the sea floor compared to the wave height  the analysis of the wave can be based upon comparison of the local wavelength with the local water arbitrary wave shapes will propagate unchanged in lossless linear time-invariant  systems  in the presence of dispersion the sine wave is the unique shape that will propagate unchanged but for phase and amplitude  making it easy to due to the kramers–kronig relations  a linear medium with dispersion also exhibits loss  so the sine wave propagating in a dispersive medium is attenuated in certain frequency ranges that depend upon the the sine function is periodic  so the sine wave or sinusoid has a wavelength in space and a period in sinusoid is defined for all times and distances  whereas in physical situations we usually deal with waves that exist for a limited span in space and duration in time  fortunately  an arbitrary wave shape can be decomposed into an infinite set of sinusoidal waves by the use of fourier analysis  as a result  the simple case of a single sinusoidal wave can be applied to more general in particular  many media are linear  or nearly so  so the calculation of arbitrary wave behavior can be found by adding up responses to individual sinusoidal waves using the superposition principle to find the solution for a general when a medium is nonlinear  the response to complex waves cannot be determined from a sine-wave  decomposition a standing wave  also known as a stationary wave  is a wave that remains in a constant position  this phenomenon can occur because the medium is moving in the opposite direction to the wave  or it can arise in a stationary medium as a result of interference between two waves traveling in opposite directions the sum of two counter-propagating  waves  of equal amplitude and frequency  creates a standing wave  standing waves commonly arise when a boundary blocks further propagation of the wave  thus causing wave reflection  and therefore introducing a counter-propagating  wave  for example  when a violin string is displaced  transverse waves propagate out to where the string is held in place at the bridge and the nut  where the waves are reflected back  at the bridge and nut  the two opposed waves are in antiphase and cancel each other  producing a node  halfway between two nodes there is an antinode  where the two counter-propagating  waves enhance each other maximally  there is no net propagation of energy over time.one-dimensional  standing waves  the fundamental mode and the first 5  overtones a two-dimensional  standing wave on a disk  this is the fundamental mode a standing wave on a disk with two nodal lines crossing at the center  this is an overtone waves exhibit common behaviors under a number of standard situations  e  g waves normally move in a straight line  i e  rectilinearly  through a transmission medium  such media can be classified into one or more of the following categories absorption of waves means  if a kind of wave strikes a matter  it will be absorbed by the matter  when a wave with that same natural frequency impinges upon an atom  then the electrons of that atom will be set into vibrational motion  if a wave of a given frequency strikes a material with electrons having the same vibrational frequencies  then those electrons will absorb the energy of the wave and transform it into vibrational motion when a wave strikes a reflective surface  it changes direction  such that the angle made by the incident wave and line normal to the surface equals the angle made by the reflected wave and the same normal line waves that encounter each other combine through superposition to create a new wave called an interference pattern  important interference patterns occur for waves that are in phase refraction is the phenomenon of a wave changing its speed  mathematically  this means that the size of the phase velocity changes  typically  refraction occurs when a wave passes from one medium into another  the amount by which a wave is refracted by a material is given by the refractive index of the material  the directions of incidence and refraction are related to the refractive indices of the two materials by snell s law a wave exhibits diffraction when it encounters an obstacle that bends the wave or when it spreads after emerging from an opening  diffraction effects are more pronounced when the size of the obstacle or opening is comparable to the wavelength of the wave the phenomenon of polarization arises when wave motion can occur simultaneously in two orthogonal directions  transverse waves can be polarized  for instance  when polarization is used as a descriptor without qualification  it usually refers to the special  simple case of linear polarization  a transverse wave is linearly polarized if it oscillates in only one direction or plane  in the case of linear polarization  it is often useful to add the relative orientation of that plane  perpendicular to the direction of travel  in which the oscillation occurs  such as  horizontal  for instance  if the plane of polarization is parallel to the ground  electromagnetic waves propagating in free space  for instance  are transverse  they can be polarized by the use of a polarizing filter longitudinal waves  such as sound waves  do not exhibit polarization  for these waves there is only one direction of oscillation  that is  along the direction of travel a wave undergoes dispersion when either the phase velocity or the group velocity depends on the wave frequency  dispersion is most easily seen by letting white light pass through a prism  the result of which is to produce the spectrum of colours of the rainbow  isaac newton performed experiments with light and prisms  presenting his findings in the opticks (1704)  that white light consists of several colours and that these colours cannot be decomposed any speed of a transverse wave traveling along a vibrating string   v   is directly proportional to the square root of the tension of the string   t   over the linear mass density   μ   where the linear density μ is the mass per unit length of the string acoustic or sound waves travel at speed given byor the square root of the adiabatic bulk modulus divided by the ambient fluid density  see speed of sound  an electromagnetic wave consists of two waves that are oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields  an electromagnetic wave travels in a direction that is at right angles to the oscillation direction of both fields  in the 19th  century  james clerk maxwell showed that  in vacuum  the electric and magnetic fields satisfy the wave equation both with speed equal to that of the speed of light  from this emerged the idea that light is an electromagnetic wave  electromagnetic waves can have different frequencies  and thus wavelengths   giving rise to various types of radiation such as radio waves  microwaves  infrared  visible light  ultraviolet  x-rays,  and gamma rays the schrödinger equation describes the wave-like  behavior of particles in quantum mechanics  solutions of this equation are wave functions which can be used to describe the probability density of a particle the dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation detailing electromagnetic interactions  dirac waves accounted for the fine details of the hydrogen spectrum in a completely rigorous way  the wave equation also implied the existence of a new form of matter  antimatter  previously unsuspected and unobserved and which was experimentally confirmed  in the context of quantum field theory  the dirac equation is reinterpreted to describe quantum fields corresponding to spin-½  particles louis de broglie postulated that all particles with momentum have a wavelengthwhere h is planck s constant  and p is the magnitude of the momentum of the particle  this hypothesis was at the basis of quantum mechanics  nowadays  this wavelength is called the de broglie wavelength  for example  the electrons in a crt display have a de broglie wavelength of about 10−13  m a wave representing such a particle traveling in the k-direction  is expressed by the wave function as follows where the wavelength is determined by the wave vector k as and the momentum by however  a wave like this with definite wavelength is not localized in space  and so cannot represent a particle localized in space  to localize a particle  de broglie proposed a superposition of different wavelengths ranging around a central value in a wave a waveform often used in quantum mechanics to describe the wave function of a particle  in a wave packet  the wavelength of the particle is not precise  and the local wavelength deviates on either side of the main wavelength value in representing the wave function of a localized particle  the wave packet is often taken to have a gaussian shape and is called a gaussian wave gaussian wave packets also are used to analyze water example  a gaussian wavefunction ψ might take the some initial time t   0,  where the central wavelength is related to the central wave vector k0  as λ0    2π    k0.  it is well known from the theory of fourier or from the heisenberg uncertainty principle  in the case of quantum mechanics  that a narrow range of wavelengths is necessary to produce a localized wave packet  and the more localized the envelope  the larger the spread in required wavelengths  the fourier transform of a gaussian is itself a given the gaussian the fourier transform is the gaussian in space therefore is made up of waves that is  a number of waves of wavelengths λ such that kλ   2  π the parameter σ decides the spatial spread of the gaussian along the x-axis,  while the fourier transform shows a spread in wave vector k determined by 1/σ.  that is  the smaller the extent in space  the larger the extent in k  and hence in λ   2π/k.gravity  waves are waves generated in a fluid medium or at the interface between two media when the force of gravity or buoyancy tries to restore equilibrium  a ripple on a pond is one example gravitational waves also travel through space  the first observation of gravitational waves was announced on 11  february gravitational waves are disturbances in the curvature of spacetime  predicted by einstein s theory of general relativity in a nonuniform medium  in which the wavenumber k can depend on the location as well as the frequency  the phase term kx is typically replaced by the integral of k x dx  according to the wkb method  such nonuniform traveling waves are common in many physical problems  including the mechanics of the cochlea and waves on hanging ropes
