 the 1978  atlantic hurricane season was the last atlantic hurricane season to use an all-female  naming list  the hurricane season officially began on june 1,  and ended on november 30.  it was an above average season due to a subsiding el niño  the first storm  a subtropical storm  developed unusually early – on january 18  – and dissipated five days later without causing any damage  at the end of july and early august  short-lived  tropical storm amelia caused extensive flooding in texas after dropping as much as 48  in (1,200  mm  of rain  there were 33  deaths and $110  million (1978  usd  in damage  tropical storm bess and hurricane cora resulted in only minor land impacts  while the latter was attributed to one fatality later in august  tropical storm debra produced widespread effects  though damage was also relatively minor  hurricane ella became the northernmost category 4  hurricane while located at 38°n,  and lashed the east coast of the united states and atlantic canada with gusty winds and rip currents  hurricanes flossie and kendra as well as tropical storms hope  irma  and juliet caused minimal land impacts as a tropical cyclone  however  the precursor to hurricane kendra caused flooding in puerto rico  hurricane greta brought strong winds  high tides  and flooding to central america  particularly belize and honduras  greta resulted in about $25  million in damage and at least five fatalities  overall  the storms of this season collectively caused $191  million in damage and 42  fatalities  hurricane greta crossed into the eastern pacific and was renamed olivia the atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1,  although 24  tropical cyclones developed  only twelve of them reached tropical storm which is slightly above the 1966-2009  average of 11.3  named storms per of the twelve tropical storms  five of them strengthened into a which is slightly below the 1966-2009  average of two of the five hurricane became major which is category 3  or greater on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind three tropical storms and two hurricanes made landfall during the season and caused at least 41  fatalities and $135  additionally  the precursor to hurricane kendra brought flooding to puerto rico  with $6  million in damage and one the season officially ended on november 30,  cyclogenesis began very early  with the development of a subtropical storm on january 18.  it dissipated about five days later  however  the next tropical cyclone  an unnumbered depression  did not develop until june 21.  in july  there were two systems  including an unnumbered tropical depression and tropical storm amelia  seven tropical cyclones formed in august  including tropical depression four and tropical storms bess and debra and hurricanes cora and ella  there were also seven system in september – tropical depressions eight  nine  and twelve  tropical storm hope  and hurricanes flossie and greta  during the month of october  there were five tropical cyclones  with two unnumbered tropical depressions  tropical storms irma and juliet  and hurricane kendra  there was another unnumbered tropical depression in november  which dissipated on november season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy  ace  rating of ace is  broadly speaking  a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed  so storms that last a long time  as well as particularly strong hurricanes  have high aces  it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39  mph (63  km h   which is tropical storm the middle of january  an upper-level  trough in the westerlies spawned a surface low-pressure  area to the east-northeast  of the lesser antilles to the south of the subtropical ridge  isolated from the detrimental effects of the westerlies  it was initially non-tropical  in nature and intensified through a baroclinic energy source  or one that derives energy from the interaction of cold and warm air  convection increased slightly despite cool sea surface temperatures of around 75  °f (24  °c   at 1200  utc on january 18,  it organized into a subtropical depression about 1,725  mi (2,776  km  east-northeast  of puerto rico while moving in a general westward track  which it would maintain for much of its the national hurricane center  nhc  initiated dvorak classifications on the cyclone at 0000  utc on january 19,  assessing a dvorak number of t2.5,  suggesting both tropical and subtropical on the same day  the pressure gradient between the storm and the ridge produced gale-force  by early on january 20,  the storm maintained minimal convection near its center  with its primary rainband revolved cyclonically around its well-defined  later that day  the storm strengthened into a subtropical storm and attained peak winds of 45  mph (72  supported by both ship and hurricane hunters on january 21,  the outer rainbands to the south and east of the center began diminishing  which began a weakening trend after the storm maintained peak winds for about 36  at around that time  the cyclone was moving west-southwestward,  and within 72  hours was forecast by one hurricane forecast model to be located over by midday on january 22,  the winds decreased to below gale force after the convection dissipated near the subsequently  it turned more to the west away from land  and by january 23  the circulation degenerated into a remnant trough about 185  mi (298  km  north of the lesser the storm was one of six tropical or subtropical cyclones on record in the month of january  and one of four to have formed in the tropical wave emerged into the atlantic ocean from the west coast of africa on july 19.  the wave did not develop significantly while crossing the atlantic ocean and caribbean sea  the disturbance then entered an area of the gulf of mexico that was conducive to tropical cyclogenesis and became a tropical depression while located about 30  mi (48  km  south of brownsville  texas on july 30.  despite its proximity to land  the depression strengthened into tropical storm amelia on july 31  and peaked with winds of 50  mph (80  km h   around that time  amelia made landfall near port isabel  later on july 31,  the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated early the following affected the texas coast for two days  causing several shipping incidents and minor damage in corpus christi and south padre while active  there were no deaths linked to the however  the biggest impact from the storm followed its dissipation  when its remnants contributed to record rainfall totals over the the state  already suffering from a previous drought  believed that the rain would help alleviate the however  the dry ground aided the flooding from the the rainfall caused several rivers and creeks to flood  especially around the texas hill country and northern texas  leading to severe overall  amelia caused 33  fatalities with an estimated $110  million in low-pressure  area developed in georgia along a dissipating cold front on august 1.  the system detached from the cold front and drifted southwestward  reaching northeastern gulf of mexico on august 3.  satellite imagery  buoys  and reconnaissance aircraft flights indicated that by august 5,  the system likely acquired a closed circulation  thus  the national hurricane center estimated that a tropical depression developed in the central gulf of mexico at 1200  utc that day  on august 6,  a reconnaissance flight into the depression resulted in an upgrade to tropical storm bess  while located about 250  mi (400  km  southeast of brownsville  texas  the storm had initially headed west-southwestward  at 8  mph (13  km h   before moving southwestward at nearly the same 1200  utc on august 7,  bess attained its minimum barometric pressure of 1,005  mbar (29.7  inhg   thereafter  bess began to turn nearly due southward under the influence of a high-pressure  area over southern texas  later on august 7,  the storm reached its maximum sustained winds of 50  mph (80  km h   early on august 8,  bess made landfall near nautla  veracruz  at the same intensity and then rapidly dissipated in tuxpan  veracruz and tampico  tamaulipas  sustained winds reached only 29  mph (47  the storm also produced heavy rainfall  peaking at 12.04  in (306  mm  in la however  no flooding occurred and no damage or fatalities were disturbance exited the west coast of africa on august 4  and developed into a tropical depression about three days later  while located well east of the lesser antilles  on august 8,  the depression strengthened into tropical storm cora  the storm moved at an unusually high forward speed for a cyclone in the atlantic ocean in august  and intensified into a hurricane later that day  the hurricane was upgraded into a hurricane based solely on satellite photography  the second time this early on august 9,  it peaked with winds of 90  mph (140  km h   around 0000  utc the next day  cora weakened to a tropical storm while moving west-southwestward.  the storm made landfall on grenada on august 11,  while weakening to a tropical depression  cora weakened further to a tropical depression  before losing its circulation and degenerating into a tropical wave on august the remnant crossed over central america into the pacific ocean  where it regenerated into hurricane was an unusual cyclone  maintaining an unusually low latitude in the atlantic in august at high speeds  while passing through the lesser antilles  gusty winds and light rainfall in barbados and saint in the latter  a person died after stepping on a high tension power line that was downed in castries  approximately two to four percent of trees on the island were cora was also responsible for altering weather conditions in presque isle  maine  allowing for a takeoff of the historical flight of the double eagle ii hot air low-pressure  area that developed over southeast florida and an area of convection near the yucatán peninsula merged and resulted in the formation of a tropical depression over the southern gulf of mexico on august 26.  tacking west-northwestward  around a high-pressure  ridge  the depression gradually intensified began and was upgraded to tropical storm debra on august 28.  debra turned to the north and reached its peak intensity of 60  mph (97  km h  on august 29,  shortly before making landfall in southwestern louisiana  it was a disorganized storm  with most of the convection located to the east of the the system weakened rapidly and dissipated over arkansas on august 29,  though its remnants continued into the ohio person died while attempting to evacuate an oil rig to the south of cameron  louisiana  damage caused by debra was considered in louisiana  rainfall peaked at 10.81  in (275  mm  in freshwater however  no flooding was wind impacts were light and mainly limited to down trees and damage to roofs in lake charles and new the storm spawned several tornadoes in mississippi  and in mississippi  a tornado in crystal springs destroyed three mobile homes and a house  killing one person and seriously injuring cold front spawned a tropical disturbance near bermuda  which became a tropical depression on august 30.  the depression strengthened  and by early on august 31,  it was upgraded to tropical storm ella  ship reports indicated that ella became a hurricane later that day  further significant intensification occurred  and the storm reached a preliminary peak intensity of 125  mph (201  km h   a short-wave  trough over the eastern united states caused ella to decelerate and turn simultaneously  dry air diminished convection on september 2,  which in turn resulted in eventually  another trough forced ella to re-curve  northeastward  thereby remaining well offshore the east coast of the united storm then re-intensified  and by 1200  utc on september 4,  ella peaked as a category 4  hurricane with winds of 140  mph (230  km h   thereafter  ella rapidly weakened as it passed offshore atlantic canada  before being absorbed by an extratropical storm while located more than 700  mi (1,100  km  northeast of st  john s on september ella threatened to pass within 50  mi (80  km  of north because of this  a hurricane watch was issued for the outer banks of north carolina during labor day weekend  resulting in a significant drop in tourism occurred  however  because the storm veered little effects other than 5  to 9  ft (1.5  to 2.7  m  minor beach erosion  and light winds in coastal portions of north in newfoundland  ella produced rainfall amounts reaching 2.39  in (61  mm  and wind gusts up to 71  mph (114  tropical wave passed westward across dakar  senegal on august 31  and entered the atlantic ocean later that day  convection markedly increased over the next few days and by 0000  utc on september 4,  the wave developed into a tropical depression while located about midway between africa and the lesser antilles  later that day  the hong kong merchant reported tropical storm force winds  thus the depression was upgraded to tropical storm flossie  it initially tracked northwestward at 23  mph (37  km h  and minimal strengthening occurred  possibly due to rapid forward speeds  on september 5,  the storm curved westward  until turning north on september 7.  a high-pressure  area transitioned into a trough  causing flossie to re-curve  northeastward and generating strong upper-level  september 8,  flossie was downgraded to a tropical after the trough began weakening  favorable conditions returned  allowing flossie to re-strengthen  into a tropical storm on september 10.  flossie then decelerated and became nearly stationary on september 12.  around that time  the storm was upgraded to a hurricane  further intensification continued  and flossie peaked with winds of 100  mph (160  km h  early on september 13.  the storm began turned nearly due northward and began weakening  flossie accelerated to the northeast and eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while 700  miles (1,100  km  north of the azores on september the strong extratropical cyclone brought winds as high as 104  mph (167  km h  to fair isle  great tropical wave developed into a tropical depression near trinidad on september 13.  by the following day  the depression strengthened into tropical storm greta  it headed westward to west-northwestward  across the caribbean sea and slowly intensified  becoming a hurricane on september the rate of intensification increased as greta was approaching the northwestern caribbean sea  greta briefly peaked as a category 4  hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130  mph (210  km h  and a minimum barometric pressure of 947  mbar (28.0  inhg   while brushing northeastern honduras  although the storm remained offshore  land interaction caused significant weakening  on september 19,  greta made landfall in stann creek district  belize with winds of 110  mph (180  the storm rapidly weakened inland over central america  but survived its passage and eventually became hurricane olivia in the eastern pacific in its duration  greta produced heavy rainfall in the netherlands with a similar path to hurricane fifi four years prior  greta threatened to reproduce the devastating effects of the catastrophic however  damage and loss of life was significantly less than in honduras  about 1,200  homes were damaged  about half of which in towns along the the storm damaged about 75%  of the houses on roatán along the offshore bay and there was one death in the in the belize barrier reef  greta downed trees and produced high while on the mainland  there was minimal flooding despite a high storm in dangriga where it made landfall  the hurricane damaged or destroyed 125  houses and the primary in belize city  a tornado flipped over a truck and damaged four damage in belize was estimated at $25  million  and there were four mid-tropospheric  low-pressure  area developed over the southeastern united states on september 10.  the system developed into a subtropical depression early on september 12,  while located about 75  mi (121  km  east of st  augustine  florida  over the next few days  the depression tracked east-northeastward  to eastward  while strengthening into a subtropical storm on september 15,  it passed just north of but produced only 1.07  in (27  mm  of rain on the the storm then made a brief dip to the east-southeast,  before resuming its east-northeastward  course on september 16.  beginning on the following day  satellite imagery indicated that the system was acquiring tropical characteristics  as a result  it was reclassified as tropical storm hope at 0600  utc on september hope remained out of range of reconnaissance aircraft flights  the national hurricane center relied on ships and satellite estimates  after becoming a tropical cyclone  hope began to accelerate while slowly intensifying  satellite estimates at 1200  utc on september 19  indicated that the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65  mph (105  km h  and a minimum pressure of 987  mbar (29.1  inhg   recorded by the s s  banglar mann  while located hundreds of miles north of the azores on september 20,  the storm turned and began crossing into sea surface temperatures of 68  °f (20  by 1200  utc on september 21,  hope transitioned into an extratropical and was absorbed by another extratropical storm while situated about 220  mi (350  km  south of reykjavík  origins of tropical storm irma were from a subtropical depression that formed about 500  mi (800  km  south of the azores on october 2.  during the next two days  thunderstorm activity gradually increased around the circulation center as the storm drifted northward  on october 2,  the storm had taken the appearance of a tropical storm on satellite photographs  and upper-level  anticyclonic flow over the center of the storm was evident on satellite time-lapse  movies  by the afternoon of october 4,  the system had acquired the characteristics of a tropical storm and was named irma  gale-force  winds extended 150  mi (240  km  from the center of hours after being named  irma reached its peak intensity of 50  mph (80  on october 5,  irma turned towards the north-northeast  and passed about midway between the central and western shortly thereafter  irma became less and that evening was absorbed into an approaching cold front  about 450  mi (720  km  northeast of the although irma passed near parts of the western and central azores with gale-force  winds in some areas  no reports of damage or casualties caused by irma were received  several nearby ships reported winds around 46  mph (74  km h   it was noted that heavy rains may have occurred on some of the mountainous islands as irma weak tropical wave emerged into the atlantic ocean from the west coast of africa on september 30.  the wave moved west-northwestward  and was centered well east of the leeward islands on october 6,  when satellite imagery indicated that deep convection became much more concentrated  the following day  ship reports noted that a closed circulation was developing  the system was classified as a tropical depression beginning at 1800  utc on october 7,  while located about 600  mi (970  km  east of puerto rico  around midday on october 8,  the depression strengthened into tropical storm peaking with maximum sustained winds of 50  mph (80  km h  and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,006  mbar (29.7  inhg  early on october 9,  juliet passed north of puerto the storm brought light rainfall to the island  peaking at 4.51  in (115  mm  at toro negro the storm then accelerated and curved northwestward  northward  and then northeastward  on october 11,  juliet merged with a frontal zone  while located west-southwest  of bermuda  later that day  the remnants moved across the island and produced up to 3  in (76  mm  of late october  a tropical wave and an area of disturbed weather combined in the northwestern caribbean  before crossing puerto rico  the system moved northwest and by late on october 28,  it became a tropical depression while located about 80  miles (130  km  north of mayaguana in the bahamas  early on the following day  it strengthened into tropical storm kendra  the storm quickly intensified while moving either north or north-northwestward  and became a hurricane late on october 29.  after peaking with winds of 80  mph (130  km h  on october 30,  kendra weakened significantly to a 50  mph (80  km h  tropical storm in only 12  hours  kendra continued north-northeastward  or northeastward  before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone while located west-northwest  of bermuda early on november precursor system dropped rainfall across much of southern puerto rico was at least 7  in (180  mm   with a peak at 20.43  in (519  mm  in pico del mudslides and flooding from the heavy precipitation left many roads impassable  washed out or collapsed several bridges  and caused considerable damage to agriculture  especially livestock  additionally  one fatality occurred and 1,710  families fled their homes for damage in puerto rico reached $6  million  a high-pressure  area and kendra combined produced strong winds and abnormally high tides along the east coast of the united states  though no damage was addition to the 12  other tropical cyclones  there were several tropical depressions that developed during the season  the first of which formed over the central gulf of mexico on june 21.  the depression moved northeastward toward florida and strengthened slightly  it dissipated by late on june 22.  another tropical depression developed about 175  mi (282  km  southwest of porto novo  cape verde on july 10.  the system moved generally westward and intensified into a strong tropical depression  before dissipating two days later  tropical depression four formed about 465  mi (748  km  east of barbados on august 7.  it tracked westward without significantly intensifying  and passed through the windward islands over bequia on the following day  the depression continued westward and passed near aruba on august 9.  it eventually traversed the caribbean sea  and made landfall to the south of bluefields  nicaragua on august 11.  the depression dissipated shortly tropical depression formed in the central gulf of mexico on august 9.  the storm moved northward and struck southeastern plaquemines parish  louisiana before dissipating the next day  by august 30,  another depression developed in the north-central  gulf of mexico  the system tracked generally eastward and avoided landfall  it dissipated around midday on september 1.  tropical depression eight developed over western senegal around 1200  utc on september 3.  the depression initially headed west-southwestward  and soon entered the atlantic ocean  between late on september 4  and early on september 5,  the system passed south of cape verde  later that day  the storm began curving west-northwestward.  by early on september 7,  it was heading northwestward and then turned to the north-northwest  the next day  the depression moved northward between september 9  and september 10,  before re-curving  to the northeast  it dissipated about 440  mi (710  km  of flores island in the azores around midday on september 1200  utc on september 8,  tropical depression nine developed over the west-central  gulf of mexico  moving generally westward  the depression made landfall south of la pesca  tamaulipas  around midday on september 10.  the system rapidly weakened inland and dissipated later that day  another tropical depression formed over western senegal on september 18.  it moved westward across the atlantic ocean before curving west-northwestward  about three days later  on september 25,  the depression moved northwestward and then northward by september 28.  it dissipated about 550  mi (890  km  east-northeast  of bermuda at 1200  utc the following day  the next tropical depression developed in the gulf of mexico just offshore campeche on september 21.  moving west-northwestward,  the depression made landfall near tampico on september 23,  shortly before tropical depression formed at 1200  utc on october 13,  while located about 55  mi (89  km  north of corvo island in the azores  the depression initially moved south-southwestward,  before curving southwestward by the following day  it then turned west-northwestward  on october 15.  late the next day  the depression turned abruptly northward  the system dissipated about 500  mi (800  km  west-northwest  of flores the next tropical depression developed at 1200  utc on october 26,  while located about 490  mi (790  km  south-southwest  of the southernmost islands of cape verde  it moved generally westward and dissipated about halfway between the lesser antilles and the west coast of africa on october 29.  the final tropical depression of the season formed about 265  mi (426  km  northeast of north abaco in the bahamas on november 3.  moving north-northeastward,  the depression turned northeastward by the next day  it dissipated about 275  mi (443  km  east of virginia beach  virginia on november following names were used for named storms that formed in the north atlantic basin in 1978.  storms were named amelia  bess  cora  flossie  hope  irma and juliet for the first time in 1978.  this was the last year that only female names were used for atlantic the name greta was retired after the 1978  season  names that were not assigned are marked in gray this is a table of the storms in 1978  and their landfall s   if any  deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect  an example of an indirect death would be a traffic
