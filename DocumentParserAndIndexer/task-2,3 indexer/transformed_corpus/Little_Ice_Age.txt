 the little ice age  lia  was a period of cooling that occurred after the medieval warm although it was not a true ice age  the term was introduced into scientific literature by françois e  matthes in it has been conventionally defined as a period extending from the 16th  to the 19th  but some experts prefer an alternative timespan from about to about climatologists and historians working with local records no longer expect to agree on either the start or end dates of the period  which varied according to local conditions the nasa earth observatory notes three particularly cold intervals  one beginning about 1650,  another about 1770,  and the last in 1850,  all separated by intervals of slight the intergovernmental panel on climate change third assessment report considered the timing and areas affected by the little ice age suggested largely-independent  regional climate changes rather than a globally-synchronous  increased glaciation  at most  there was modest cooling of the northern hemisphere during the causes have been proposed  cyclical lows in solar radiation  heightened volcanic activity  changes in the ocean circulation  variations in earth s orbit and axial tilt  orbital forcing   inherent variability in global climate  and decreases in the human population the intergovernmental panel on climate change third assessment report  tar  of 2001  described the areas affected evidence from mountain glaciers does suggest increased glaciation in a number of widely spread regions outside europe prior to the twentieth century  including alaska  new zealand and patagonia  however  the timing of maximum glacial advances in these regions differs considerably  suggesting that they may represent largely independent regional climate changes  not a globally-synchronous  increased glaciation  thus current evidence does not support globally synchronous periods of anomalous cold or warmth over this interval  and the conventional terms of  little ice age  and  medieval warm period  appear to have limited utility in describing trends in hemispheric or global mean temperature changes in past centuries     hemispherically  the  little ice age  can only be considered as a modest cooling of the northern hemisphere during this period of less than 1°c  relative to late twentieth century ipcc fourth assessment report (ar4)  of 2007  discusses more recent research  giving particular attention to the medieval warm period  it states that  when viewed together  the currently available reconstructions indicate generally greater variability in centennial time scale trends over the last 1  kyr than was apparent in the tar     the result is a picture of relatively cool conditions in the seventeenth and early nineteenth centuries and warmth in the eleventh and early fifteenth centuries  but the warmest conditions are apparent in the twentieth century  given that the confidence levels surrounding all of the reconstructions are wide  virtually all reconstructions are effectively encompassed within the uncertainty previously indicated in the tar  the major differences between the various proxy reconstructions relate to the magnitude of past cool excursions  principally during the twelfth to fourteenth  seventeenth and nineteenth is no consensus regarding the time when the little ice age but a series of events before the known climatic minima has often been referenced  in the 13th  century  pack ice began advancing southwards in the north atlantic  as did glaciers in greenland  anecdotal evidence suggests expanding glaciers almost worldwide  based on radiocarbon dating of roughly 150  samples of dead plant material with roots intact  collected from beneath ice caps on baffin island and iceland  miller et al  state that cold summers and ice growth began abruptly between 1275  and 1300,  followed by  a substantial intensification  from 1430  to contrast  a climate reconstruction based on glacial shows no great variation from 1600  to 1850  but strong retreat thereafter therefore  any of several dates ranging over 400  years may indicate the beginning of the little ice age the little ice age ended in the latter half of the 19th  century or early in the 20th  little ice age brought colder winters to parts of europe and north america  farms and villages in the swiss alps were destroyed by encroaching glaciers during the mid-17th  canals and rivers in great britain and the netherlands were frequently frozen deeply enough to support ice skating and winter the first river thames frost fair was in 1607  and the last in 1814;  changes to the bridges and the addition of the thames embankment affected the river flow and depth  greatly diminishing the possibility of further freezes  freezing of the golden horn and the southern section of the bosphorus took place in 1622.  in 1658,  a swedish army marched across the great belt to denmark to attack copenhagen  the winter of 1794–1795  was particularly harsh  the french invasion army under pichegru was able to march on the frozen rivers of the netherlands  and the dutch fleet was fixed in the ice in den helder harbour sea ice surrounding iceland extended for miles in every direction  closing harbors to shipping  the population of iceland fell by half  but that may have been caused by skeletal fluorosis after the eruption of laki in iceland also suffered failures of cereal crops and people moved away from a grain-based  the norse colonies in greenland starved and vanished by the early 15th  century  as crops failed and livestock could not be maintained through increasingly harsh winters  but jared diamond has suggested they had exceeded the agricultural carrying capacity before then  greenland was largely cut off by ice from 1410  to the twentieth century climatologist hubert lamb said that in many years   snowfall was much heavier than recorded before or since  and the snow lay on the ground for many months longer than it does in lisbon  portugal  snowstorms were much more frequent than today  one winter in the 17th  century produced eight many springs and summers were cold and wet but with great variability between years and groups of years  crop practices throughout europe had to be altered to adapt to the shortened  less reliable growing season  and there were many years of dearth and famine  such as the great famine of 1315–1317,  but that may have been before the little ice according to elizabeth ewan and janay nugent   famines in france 1693–94,  norway 1695–96  and sweden 1696–97  claimed roughly 10  percent of the population of each country  in estonia and finland in 1696–97,  losses have been estimated at a fifth and a third of the national populations  viticulture disappeared from some northern regions and storms caused serious flooding and loss of life  some of them resulted in permanent loss of large areas of land from the danish  german  and dutch violin maker antonio stradivari produced his instruments during the little ice age  the colder climate is proposed to have caused the wood used in his violins to be denser than in warmer periods  contributing to the tone of his according to the science historian james burke  the period inspired such novelties in everyday life as the widespread use of buttons and button-holes,  knitting of custom-made  undergarments to better cover and insulate the body  fireplace hoods were installed to make more efficient use of fires for indoor heating  and enclosed stoves were developed  with early versions often covered with ceramic little ice age  by anthropology professor brian fagan of the university of california at santa barbara  tells of the plight of european peasants during the 1300  to

alpine villagers lived on bread made from ground nutshells mixed with barley and oat flour   historian wolfgang behringer has linked intensive witch-hunting  episodes in europe to agricultural failures during the little ice james burroughs analyses the depiction of winter in paintings  as does hans burroughs asserts that it occurred almost entirely from 1565  to 1665  and was associated with the climatic decline from 1550  onwards  burroughs claims that there had been almost no depictions of winter in art  and he  hypothesizes that the unusually harsh winter of 1565  inspired great artists to depict highly original images and that the decline in such paintings was a combination of the  theme  having been fully explored and mild winters interrupting the flow of wintry scenes  which entail technical difficulties in painting  have been regularly and well handled since the early 15th  century by artists in illuminated manuscript cycles showing the labours of the months  typically placed on the calendar pages of books of hours  january and february are typically shown as snowy  as in february in the famous cycle in the les très riches heures du duc de berry  painted 1412–1416  and illustrated below  since landscape painting had not yet developed as independent genre in art  the absence of other winter scenes is not remarkable the famous winter landscape paintings by pieter brueghel the elder  such as the hunters in the snow  are all thought to have been painted in 1565.  his son pieter brueghel the younger (1564–1638)  also painted many snowy landscapes  but according to burroughs  he  slavishly copied his father s designs  the derivative nature of so much of this work makes it difficult to draw any definite conclusions about the influence of the winters between 1570  and says that snowy subjects return to dutch golden age painting with works by hendrick avercamp from 1609  onwards  there is then a hiatus between 1627  and 1640,  before the main period of such subjects from the 1640s  to the 1660s,  which relates well with climate records for the later period  the subjects are less popular after about 1660,  but that does not match any recorded reduction in severity of winters and may reflect only changes in taste or fashion  in the later period between the 1780s  and 1810s,  snowy subjects again became analysed 12,000  paintings

between 1600  and and contemporary records in scotland demonstrate that curling and ice skating were popular outdoor winter sports  with curling dating back to the 16th  century and becoming widely popular in the mid-19th  as an example  an outdoor curling pond constructed in gourock in the 1860s  remained in use for almost a century  but increasing use of indoor facilities  problems of vandalism  and milder winters led to the pond being abandoned in european explorers and settlers of north america reported exceptionally severe winters  for example  according to lamb  samuel champlain reported bearing ice along the shores of lake superior in june 1608.  both europeans and indigenous peoples suffered excess mortality in maine during the winter of 1607–1608,  and extreme frost was reported in the jamestown  virginia  settlement at the same native americans formed leagues in response to food the journal of pierre de troyes  chevalier de troyes  who led an expedition to

around the sun has  for the past 2,000  years  caused a long-term  northern hemisphere cooling trend that continued through the middle ages and the little ice age  the rate of arctic cooling is roughly 0.02  °c per this trend could be extrapolated to continue into the future  possibly leading to a full ice age  but the twentieth-century  instrumental temperature record shows a sudden reversal of this trend  with a rise in global temperatures attributed to greenhouse gas is still a very poor understanding of the correlation between low sunspot activity and cooling during the period 1645–1715,  in the middle of the little ice age  there was a period of low solar activity known as the maunder minimum  the spörer minimum has also been identified with a significant cooling period between 1460  and other indicators of low solar activity during this period are levels of the isotopes carbon-14  and a 2012  paper  miller et al  link the little ice age to an  unusual 50-year-long  episode with four large sulfur-rich  explosive eruptions  each with global sulfate loading >60  tg  and notes that  large changes in solar irradiance are not the little ice age  the world experienced heightened volcanic when a volcano erupts  its ash reaches high into the atmosphere and can spread to cover the whole earth  the ash cloud blocks out some of the incoming solar radiation  leading to worldwide cooling that can last up to two years after an eruption  also emitted by eruptions is sulfur  in the form of sulfur dioxide gas  when it reaches the stratosphere  it turns into sulfuric acid particles  which reflect the sun s rays  further reducing the amount of radiation reaching earth s surface a recent study found that an especially massive tropical volcanic eruption in 1257,  possibly of the now-extinct  mount samalas near mount rinjani  both in lombok  indonesia  followed by three smaller eruptions in 1268,  1275,  and 1284  did not allow the climate to recover  this may have caused the initial cooling  and the 1452–53  eruption of kuwae in vanuatu triggered a second pulse of the cold summers can be maintained by sea-ice/ocean  feedbacks long after volcanic aerosols are removed other volcanoes that erupted during the era and may have contributed to the cooling include billy mitchell  ca  1580),  huaynaputina (1600),  mount parker (1641),  long island  papua new guinea   ca  1660),  and laki the 1815  eruption of tambora  also in indonesia  blanketed the atmosphere with ash  the following year  1816,  came to be known as the year without a summer  when frost and snow were reported in june and july in both new england and northern europe another possibility is that there was a slowing of thermohaline the circulation could have been interrupted by the introduction of a large amount of fresh water into the north atlantic  possibly caused by a period of warming before the little ice age known as the medieval warm there is some concern that a shutdown of thermohaline circulation could happen again as a result of the present warming researchers have proposed that human influences on climate began earlier than is normally supposed  see early anthropocene for more details  and that major population declines in eurasia and the americas reduced this impact  leading to a cooling trend  william ruddiman has proposed that somewhat reduced populations of europe  east asia  and the middle east during and after the black death caused a decrease in agricultural activity  he suggests reforestation took place  allowing more carbon dioxide uptake from the atmosphere  which may have been a factor in the cooling noted during the little ice age  ruddiman further hypothesizes that a reduced population in the americas after european contact in the early sixteenth century could have had a similar faust  gnecco  mannstein and stamm and nevle supported depopulation in the americas as a factor  asserting that humans had cleared considerable amounts of forest to support agriculture in the americas before the arrival of europeans brought on a population collapse  a 2008  study of sediment cores and soil samples further suggests that carbon dioxide uptake via reforestation in the americas could have contributed to the little ice the depopulation is linked to a drop in carbon dioxide levels observed at law dome  has been speculated that increased human populations living at high latitudes caused the little ice age through deforestation  the increased albedo due to this deforestation  more reflection of solar rays from snow-covered  ground than dark  tree-covered  area  could have had a profound effect on global fluctuations in global climate might explain past variability  it is very difficult to know what the true level of variability from only internal causes might be since other forcings  as noted above  exist whose magnitude may not be known either  one approach to evaluating internal variability is to use long integrations of coupled ocean-atmosphere  global climate models  they have the advantage that the external forcing is known to be zero  but the disadvantage is that they may not fully reflect reality  the variations may result from chaos-driven  changes in the oceans  the atmosphere  or interactions between the two studies have concluded that the demonstrated inherent variability is not great enough to account for the little ice
