 the azores–gibraltar transform fault  agfz   also called a fault zone and a fracture zone  is a major seismic fault in the central atlantic ocean west of the strait of gibraltar  it is the product of the complex interaction between the african  eurasian  and iberian the agfz produced the large-magnitude  1755  lisbon and 1969  horseshoe earthquakes and  consequently  a number of large the atlantic segment of the boundary between the african and eurasian plates  the agfz is largely dominated by compressional forces between these converging (3.8  to 5.6  mm a (0.0047  to 0.0070  in ms   plates  but it is subject of a dynamic tectonic regime also involving extension  trancurrent faulting  and compression  the oceanic lithosphere in the area is directly related to the opening of the north atlantic ocean and one of the oldest preserved on western end of the agfz  the azores triple junction on the mid-atlantic  ridge  mar   is where the north american  african  and eurasian plates meet  spreading in the mar is faster south of the agfz than north of it  which results in a trancurrent movement along the agfz at about 4  mm a (0.0050  the eastern segment of the fault is complex and characterised by a series of seamounts and ridges separating the tores and horseshoe abyssal plains  the active compressional deformation in this segment is an extremely rare example of compression between two oceanic atlantic ocean is surrounded by passive margins with the exception of three subduction zones  the lesser antilles arc in the caribbean  the scotia arc in the south atlantic  and the gibraltar arc in the western mediterranean  the gibraltar arc is propagating westward into the atlantic over an east-dipping  oceanic slab  one of the remainders of the tethys ocean   this subduction/back-arc  basin system is developing in front of the alboran block  under the alboran sea  at a rate faster than that of the africa-iberia  convergence  consequently  this area is a rare case of a passive margin slowly being transformed into an active the extension of this subduction system  known as the  allochthonous unit of the gulf of cadiz   augz   marks the continuing propagation of the alpide belt into the atlantic along the in the context of the wilson cycle  this suggests that the beginning of the closure of the atlantic is taking place in front of the three atlantic subduction 37°n  16°w﻿    ﻿37°n  16°w﻿    37;  -16
