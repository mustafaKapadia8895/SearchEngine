nebraska  and by 1719  had signed treaties with several of these peoples  after war broke out between the two countries  spain dispatched an armed expedition to nebraska under lieutenant general pedro de villasur in 1720.  the party was attacked and destroyed near present-day  columbus by a large force of pawnees and otoes  both allied to the french  the massacre ended spanish exploration of the

europeans and americans  under the homestead act  thousands of settlers migrated into nebraska to claim free land granted by the federal government  because so few trees grew on the prairies  many of the first farming settlers built their homes of sod  as had the native americans such as the omaha  the first wave of settlement gave the territory a sufficient population to apply for nebraska became

factors contributed to attracting new residents  the first was that the vast prairie land was perfect for cattle grazing  this helped settlers to learn the unfamiliar geography of the area  the second factor was the invention of several farming technologies  agricultural inventions such as barbed wire  wind mills  and the steel plow  combined with good weather  enabled settlers to use of nebraska

1867,  its legislature consisted of two houses  a house of representatives and a senate  for years  u s  senator george norris and other nebraskans encouraged the idea of a unicameral legislature  and demanded the issue be decided in a referendum  norris argued the constitutions of our various states are built upon the idea that there is but one class  if this be true  there is no sense or reason in having the same thing done twice  especially if it is to be done by two bodies of men elected in the same way and having the same jurisdiction unicameral supporters also argued that a bicameral legislature had a significant undemocratic feature in the committees that reconciled house and senate legislation  votes in these committees were secretive  and would sometimes add provisions to bills that neither house had approved  nebraska s unicameral legislature today has rules that bills can contain only one subject  and must be given at least five days of consideration  in 1934,  due in part to the budgetary pressure of the great depression  nebraska citizens ran a state initiative to vote on a constitutional amendment creating a unicameral legislature  which was approved  which  in

presidential elections  under a 1991  law  two of nebraska s five votes are awarded to the winner of the statewide popular vote  while the other three go to the highest vote-getter  in each of the state s three congressional districts for most of its history  nebraska has been a solidly republican state  republicans have carried the state in all but one presidential election since 1940:  the 1964  landslide election of lyndon b  johnson  in the 2004  presidential election  george w  bush won the state s five electoral votes by a margin of 33  percentage points  making nebraska s the fourth-strongest  republican vote among states  with 65.9%  of the overall vote  only thurston county  which is majority-native  american  voted for his democratic challenger john kerry  in 2008,  the state split its electoral votes for the first time  republican john mccain won the popular vote in nebraska as a whole and two of its three congressional districts  the second district  which includes the city of omaha  went for democrat barack obama despite the current republican domination of nebraska politics  the state has a long tradition of electing centrist members of both parties to state and federal office  examples include george w  norris  who served few years in the senate as an independent   j  james exon  and bob kerrey  voters have tilted to the right in recent years with the
