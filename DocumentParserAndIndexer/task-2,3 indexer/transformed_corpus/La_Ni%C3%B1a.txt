 la niña   lɑːˈniːnjə   spanish pronunciation  ˈniɲa   is a coupled ocean-atmosphere  phenomenon that is the counterpart of el niño as part of the broader el niño–southern oscillation climate pattern  the name la niña originates from spanish  meaning  the little girl   analogous to el niño meaning  the little boy   it has also in the past been called anti-el  needed  and el viejo  meaning  the old during a period of la niña  the sea surface temperature across the equatorial eastern central pacific ocean will be lower than normal by 3  to 5  °c  in the united states  an appearance of la niña persists for at least five months  it has extensive effects on the weather in north america  even affecting the atlantic and pacific hurricane seasons la niña is the positive phase of the el niño southern oscillation and is associated with cooler-than-average  sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical pacific however  each country and island nation has a different threshold for what constitutes a la niña event  which is tailored to their specific for example  the australian bureau of meteorology looks at the trade winds  soi  weather models and sea surface temperatures in the niño 3  and 3.4  regions before declaring that a la niña event has however  the japan meteorological agency declares that a la niña event has started when the average five-month  sea surface temperature deviation for the nino.3  region is more than 0.5  °c (0.90  °f  cooler for 6  consecutive months or timeline of all la niña episodes between 1900  and was a relatively strong la niña episode during 1988–1989.  la niña also formed in late in 1995,  and a protracted la niña event that lasted from mid-1998  through early 2001.  this was followed by a neutral period between 2001  and 2002.  the la niña which developed in mid-2007,  and lasted until almost 2009,  was a moderate one  the strength of la niña made the 2008  atlantic hurricane season one of the five most active since 1944;  sixteen named storms had winds of at least 39  miles per hour (63  km h   eight of which became 74-mile-per-hour  (119  km h  or greater new la niña episode developed quite quickly in the eastern and central tropical pacific in and lasted until early it intensified again in mid-2011  and lasted until early this la niña  combined with record-high  ocean temperatures in the north-eastern  indian ocean  was a large factor in the 2010–2011  queensland and the quartet of recent heavy snowstorms in north america starting with the december 2010  north american blizzard  the same la niña event was also a likely cause of a series of tornadoes of above-average  severity that struck the midwestern and southern united states in the spring of 2011,  and drought conditions in the south central states including texas  oklahoma and meanwhile  a series of major storms caused extensive flooding in california in december 2010,  with seven consecutive days of non-stop  rainfall  leading to one of the wettest decembers in over 120  years of records  this is in contrast to the drier-than-normal  conditions typically associated with la niña in 2011,  on a global scale  la niña events helped keep the average global temperature below recent trends  as a result  2011  tied with 1997  for the eleventh-warmest  year on record  it was the second-coolest  year of the 21st  century to date  and tied with the second-warmest  year of the 20th  century  a relatively strong phase of la niña opened the year  dissipated in the spring before re-emerging  in october and lasted through the end of the year  when compared to previous la niña years  the 2011  global surface temperature was the warmest observed  the 2011  globally-averaged  precipitation over land was the second-wettest  year on record  behind 2010.  precipitation varied greatly across the globe  this la niña contributed to severe drought in east africa and to australia s third-wettest  year in its 112-year  period of niñas occurred in 1904,  1908,  1910,  1916,  1924,  1928,  1938,  1954–56,  1964,  1970–72,  1973–76,  1988–89,  1995–96,  1998–2001,  2007–08,  2010–12  and niña impacts the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns  which as a result can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in of la niña events since 1950,  show that impacts associated with la niña events depend on what season it however  while certain events and impacts are expected to occur during events  it is not certain or guaranteed that they will niña results in wetter-than-normal  conditions in southern africa from december to february  and drier-than-normal  conditions over equatorial east africa over the same la niña years  the formation of tropical cyclones  along with the subtropical ridge position  shifts westward across the western pacific ocean  which increases the landfall threat to in march 2008,  la niña caused a drop in sea surface temperatures over southeast asia by 2  °c  it also caused heavy rains over malaysia  the philippines  and niña causes mostly the opposite effects of el niño  above-average  precipitation across the northern midwest  the northern rockies  northern california  and the pacific northwest s southern and eastern regions  meanwhile  precipitation in the southwestern and southeastern states is below this also allows for the development of many stronger-than-average  hurricanes in the atlantic and fewer in the pacific the synoptic condition for tehuantepecer winds is associated with high-pressure  system forming in sierra madre of mexico in the wake of an advancing cold front  which causes winds to accelerate through the isthmus of tehuantepec  tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts  between october and february  with a summer maximum in july caused by the westward extension of the azores-bermuda  high pressure system  wind magnitude is weaker during la niña years than el niño years  due to the less frequent cold frontal incursions during la niña with its effects can last from a few hours to six canada  la niña will  in general  cause a cooler  snowier winter  such as the near-record-breaking  amounts of snow recorded in la niña winter of 2007/2008  in eastern a time of la niña  drought plagues the coastal regions of peru and from december to february  northern brazil is wetter than la niña causes higher than normal rainfall in the central andes  which in turn causes catastrophic flooding on the llanos de mojos of beni department  bolivia  such flooding is documented from 1853,  1865,  1872,  1873,  1886,  1895,  1896,  1907,  1921,  1928,  1929  and traditional la niña  also called eastern pacific  ep  la involves temperature anomalies in the eastern pacific  however  in the last two decades  nontraditional la niña were observed  in which the usual place of the temperature anomaly  niño 1  and 2)  is not affected  but an anomaly arises in the central pacific  niño the phenomenon is called central pacific  cp  la  dateline  la niña  because the anomaly arises near the dateline   or la niña  modoki   modoki is japanese for  similar  but there are flavors of enso additional to ep and cp types and some scientists argue that enso exists as a continuum often with hybrid effects of the cp la niña are different from those of the traditional ep la niña—e g   the recently discovered la niña leads to a rainfall increase over northwestern australia and northern murray-darling  basin  rather than over the east as in a conventional la also  la niña modoki increases the frequency of cyclonic storms over bay of bengal  but decreases the occurrence of severe storms in the indian ocean overall  with the arabian sea becoming severely non-conductive  to tropical cyclone recent discovery of enso modoki has some scientists believing it to be linked to global however  comprehensive satellite data go back only to 1979.  generally  there is no scientific consensus on how if climate change may affect is also a scientific debate on the very existence of this  new  enso  a number of studies dispute the reality of this statistical distinction or its increasing occurrence  or both  either arguing the reliable record is too short to detect such a finding no distinction or trend using other statistical or that other types should be distinguished  such as standard and extreme years when la niña modoki events occurred include 1973–74,  1975–76,  1983–84,  1988–89,  1998–99,  2000–01,  2008–09,  2010–11  and
