 cumulonimbus  from the latin cumulus   heap   and nimbus   rainstorm    storm cloud    is a dense towering vertical associated with thunderstorms and atmospheric instability  forming from water vapor carried by powerful upward air currents  if observed during a storm  these clouds may be referred to as thunderheads  cumulonimbus can form alone  in clusters  or along cold front squall lines  these clouds are capable of producing lightning and other dangerous severe weather  such as tornadoes  cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped cumulus congestus clouds and may further develop as part of a supercell  cumulonimbus is abbreviated cb towering cumulonimbus clouds are typically accompanied by smaller cumulus clouds  the cumulonimbus base may extend several miles across and occupy low to middle altitudes-  formed at altitude from approximately 200  to 4,000  m (700  to 10,000  ft   peaks typically reach to as much as 40,000  ft (12,000  m   with extreme instances as high as 70,000  ft (21,000  m  or well-developed  cumulonimbus clouds are characterized by a flat  anvil-like  top  anvil dome   caused by wind shear or inversion near the tropopause  the shelf of the anvil may precede the main cloud s vertical component for many miles  and be accompanied by lightning  occasionally  rising air parcels surpass the equilibrium level  due to momentum  and form an overshooting top culminating at the maximum parcel level  when vertically developed  this largest of all clouds usually extends through all three cloud regions  even the smallest cumulonimbus cloud dwarfs its neighbors in comparison cumulonimbus calvusa clearly developed cumulonimbus fibrous-edged  top capillatusanvil-topped  incusarcus cloud  shelf cloud  leading a thunderstormmammatocumulus with drooping pouchesa cap  pileus  atop a calvusa funnel cloud  tuba  over the netherlandsincus with a velum edgecumulonimbus calvus against sunlight with rain falling beneath it as a rain shaft  praecipatio rain evaporating before reaching the ground  virga picture of a cumulonimbus calvus cloud over zambales mountains  taken from subic–clark–tarlac expresswaypicture of a cumulonimbus capillatus cloud over africa displaying an overshooting top  taken from the international space stationflanking line in front of a strong thunderstormcumulonimbus storm cells can produce torrential rain of a convective nature  often in the form of a rain shaft  and flash flooding  as well as straight-line  winds  most storm cells die after about 20  minutes  when the precipitation causes more downdraft than updraft  causing the energy to dissipate  if there is enough solar energy in the atmosphere  however  on a hot summer s day  for example   the moisture from one storm cell can evaporate rapidly—resulting in a new cell forming just a few miles from the former one  this can cause thunderstorms to last for several hours  cumulonimbus clouds can also bring dangerous winter storms  called  blizzards   which bring lightning  thunder  and torrential snow  however  cumulonimbus clouds are most common in tropical general  cumulonimbus require moisture  an unstable air mass  and a lifting force  heat  in order to form  cumulonimbus typically go through three stages  the developing stage  the mature stage  where the main cloud may reach supercell status in favorable conditions   and the dissipation the average thunderstorm has a 24  km (15  mi  diameter  depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere  these three stages take an average of 30  minutes to go form when the dewpoint of water is reached in the presence of condensation nuclei in the troposphere  the atmosphere is a dynamic system  and the local conditions of turbulence  uplift and other parameters give rise to many types of clouds  various types of cloud occur frequently enough to have been categorized  furthermore  some atmospheric processes can make the clouds organize in distinct patterns such as wave clouds or actinoform clouds  these are large-scale  structures and are not always readily identifiable from a single point of view
