 rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then becomes heavy enough to fall under gravity  rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the earth  it provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems  as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation the major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional  zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts  if enough moisture and upward motion is present  precipitation falls from convective clouds  those with strong upward vertical motion  such as cumulonimbus  thunder clouds  which can organize into narrow rainbands  in mountainous areas  heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains  on the leeward side of mountains  desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass  the movement of the monsoon trough  or intertropical convergence zone  brings rainy seasons to savannah climes the urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall  both in amounts and intensity  downwind of cities  global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally  including wetter conditions across eastern north america and drier conditions in the needed  antarctica is the driest continent  the globally averaged annual precipitation over land is 715  mm (28.1  in   but over the whole earth it is much higher at 990  mm (39  climate classification systems such as the köppen classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes  rainfall is measured using rain gauges  rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar rain is also known or suspected on other planets  where it may be composed of methane  neon  sulfuric acid  or even iron rather than water air contains water vapor  and the amount of water in a given mass of dry air  known as the mixing ratio  is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air the amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity  which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air how much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%  relative humidity  and forms into a cloud  a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the earth s depends on its temperature  warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated  therefore  one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it  the dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point  adiabatic cooling  conductive cooling  radiational cooling  and evaporative cooling  adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and the air can rise due to convection  large-scale  atmospheric motions  or a physical barrier such as a mountain  orographic lift   conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder usually by being blown from one surface to another  for example from a liquid water surface to colder land  radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation  either by the air or by the surface evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation  which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb  temperature  or until it reaches main ways water vapor is added to the air are  wind convergence into areas of upward precipitation or virga falling from daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans  water bodies or wet transpiration from cool or dry air moving over warmer and lifting air over water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust  ice  and salt in order to form clouds  elevated portions of weather fronts  which are three-dimensional  in force broad areas of upward motion within the earth s atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool  stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass  it can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets  air resistance typically causes the water droplets in a cloud to remain stationary  when air turbulence occurs  water droplets collide  producing larger droplets as these larger water droplets descend  coalescence continues  so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain  coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing  and is also known as the warm rain in clouds below freezing  when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall  this generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring water droplets  this process is temperature dependent  as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing  in addition  because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level  these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become have sizes ranging from 0.1  to 9  mm (0.0039  to 0.3543  in  mean diameter  above which they tend to break up  smaller drops are called cloud droplets  and their shape is spherical

consequence of slow ascent of air in synoptic systems  on the order of cm s   such as in the vicinity of cold fronts and near and poleward of surface warm fronts  similar ascent is seen around

but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass  occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure  what separates rainfall from other precipitation types  such as ice pellets and snow  is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water  which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground  if there is a shallow

winter precipitation over mountains and suppress are cloud and precipitation areas which are significantly elongated  rainbands can be stratiform or and are generated by differences in temperature  when noted on weather radar imagery  this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward and tend to be wide and stratiform in spawned near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which are able to produce rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the

tropical storm  the extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone s phrase acid rain was first used by scottish chemist robert augus smith in the ph of rain varies  especially due to its origin  on america s east coast  rain that is derived from the atlantic ocean typically has a ph of 5.0-5.6;  rain that comes across the continental from the west has a ph of 3.8-4.8;  and local thunderstorms can have a ph as low as rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids  sulfuric acid (h2so4)  and nitric acid (hno3).  sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes  and wetlands  sulfate reducing bacteria   and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels  and mining where h2s  is present  nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning  soil bacteria  and natural fires  while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants  in the past 20  years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater  which may be due to the significant increase in ammonium  most likely as ammonia from livestock production   which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation  the most commonly used form of the köppen classification has five primary types labeled a through e  specifically  the primary types are a  tropical  b  dry  c  mild mid-latitude;  d  cold mid-latitude;  and e  polar  the five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest  monsoon  tropical savanna  humid subtropical  humid continental  oceanic climate  mediterranean climate  steppe  subarctic climate

or more accurately   depth  being measured is the depth of rain water that would accumulate on a flat  horizontal and impermeable surface during a given amount of time  typically an one millimeter of rainfall is the equivalent of one liter of water per square standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge  which can be found in 100-mm  (4-in)  plastic and 200-mm  (8-in)  metal the inner cylinder is filled by 25  mm (0.98  in  of rain  with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder  plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to 0.25  mm (0.0098  in

a network is not available in the area where one lives  the nearest local weather or met office will likely be interested in the of the main uses of weather radar is to be able to assess the amount of precipitations fallen over large basins for hydrological for instance  river flood control  sewer management and dam construction are all areas where planners use rainfall accumulation data  radar-derived  rainfall estimates compliment surface station data which can be used for calibration  to produce radar accumulations  rain rates over a point are estimated by using the value of reflectivity data at individual grid points  a radar equation is then used  which is where z represents the radar reflectivity  r represents the rainfall rate  and a and b are satellite derived rainfall estimates use passive microwave instruments aboard polar orbiting as well as geostationary weather satellites to indirectly measure rainfall if one wants an accumulated rainfall over a time period  one has to add up all the accumulations from each grid box within the images during that time rainfall intensity is classified according to the rate of precipitation euphemisms for a heavy or violent rain include gully washer  trash-mover  and the intensity can also be expressed by rainfall erosivity  likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and duration  is called

of watering  is important to agriculture  while a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants  too much or too little rainfall can be harmful  even devastating to crops  drought can kill crops and increase while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive  for example  certain cacti require small amounts of while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive in areas with wet and dry seasons  soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet animals have adaptation and survival
