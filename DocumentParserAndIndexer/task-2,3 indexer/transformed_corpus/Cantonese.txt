 cantonese  or standard cantonese  is a variety of the chinese language spoken within guangzhou  historically canton  and its vicinity in southeastern china  it is the traditional prestige variety of yue  one of the major subdivisions of chinese in mainland china  it is the lingua franca of the province of guangdong  being the majority language of the pearl river delta  and neighbouring areas such as guangxi  it is the dominant and official language of hong kong and macau  cantonese is also widely spoken amongst overseas chinese in southeast asia  most notably in vietnam and malaysia  as well as in singapore and cambodia to a lesser extent  and throughout the western world while the term cantonese refers narrowly to the prestige variety  it is often used in a broader sense for the entire yue subdivision of chinese  including related but largely mutually unintelligible languages such as taishanese  when cantonese and the closely related yuehai dialects are classified together  there are about 80  million total cantonese is viewed as a vital part of the cultural identity for its native speakers across large swaths of southeastern china  hong kong and macau although cantonese shares some vocabulary with mandarin  the two varieties are mutually unintelligible because of differences in pronunciation  grammar and lexicon  sentence structure  in particular the placement of verbs  sometimes differs between the two varieties  a notable difference between cantonese and mandarin is how the spoken word is written  both can be recorded verbatim but very few cantonese speakers are knowledgeable in the full cantonese written vocabulary  so a non-verbatim  formalised written form is adopted which is more akin to the mandarin written this results in the situation in which a cantonese and a mandarin text may look similar  but are pronounced differently in english  the term  cantonese  is ambiguous  cantonese proper is the variety native to the city of canton  which is the traditional english name of guangzhou  this narrow sense may be specified as  canton language  or  guangzhou language  in  cantonese  may also refer to the primary branch of cantonese that contains cantonese proper as well as taishanese and gaoyang  this broader usage may be specified as  yue   s粤  t粵   in this article   cantonese  is used for cantonese proper historically  speakers called this variety  canton speech  or  guangzhou speech   广州话  廣州話  gwóngjāu wá   although this term is now seldom used outside mainland china  in guangdong province  people also call it  provincial capital speech   省城话  省城話  sáangsìng wá  or  plain speech   白话  白話  baahk wá in hong kong and macau  as well as among overseas chinese communities  the language is referred to as  guangdong speech   广东话  廣東話  gwóngdūng wá  or simply  chinese   chinese  中文  cantonese yale  in mainland china  the term  guangdong speech  is also increasingly being used among both native and non-native  speakers  given the history of the development of yue dialects during the tang dynasty migrations to the region  in overseas chinese communities  it is also referred to as 唐話  given that people refer to themselves as 唐人 due to its status as a prestige dialect among all the dialects of the yue branch of chinese varieties  it is often called  standard cantonese   标准粤语  標準粵語  bīujéun yuhtyúh  the official languages of hong kong are chinese and english  as defined in the hong kong basic the chinese language has many different varieties  of which cantonese is one  given the traditional predominance of cantonese within hong kong  it is the de facto official spoken form of the chinese language used in the hong kong government and all courts and tribunals  it is also used as the medium of instruction in schools  alongside english a similar situation also exists in neighboring macau  where chinese is an official language along with portuguese  as in hong kong  cantonese is the predominant spoken variety of chinese used in everyday life and is thus the official form of chinese used in the government  the cantonese spoken in hong kong and macau is mutually intelligible with the cantonese spoken in the mainland city of guangzhou  although there exist some minor differences in accent  pronunciation and vocabulary cantonese first developed around the port city of guangzhou in the pearl river delta region of southeastern china  due to the city s long standing as an important cultural center  cantonese emerged as the prestige dialect of the yue varieties of chinese in the southern song dynasty and its usage spread around most of what is now the provinces of guangdong and the cession of macau to portugal in 1557  and hong kong to britain in 1842,  the ethnic chinese population of the two territories largely originated from the 19th  and 20th  century immigration from guangzhou and surrounding areas  making cantonese the prominent chinese language in the territories  on the mainland  cantonese continued to serve as the lingua franca of guangdong and guangxi provinces even after mandarin was made the official language of the government by the qing dynasty in the early cantonese remained the dominant and influential language in southeastern china until the establishment of the people s republic of china in 1949  and its promotion of standard chinese as the sole official language of the nation throughout the last half of the 20th  century  although its influence is still strong in the the chinese government discourages the use of all forms of chinese except standard chinese  cantonese enjoys a relatively higher standing than other chinese languages  with its own media and usage in public transportation in guangdong furthermore  it is also a medium of instruction in select academic curricula  including some university elective courses and chinese as a foreign language the permitted usage of cantonese in mainland china is largely a countermeasure against hong kong s influence  as the autonomous territory has the right to freedom of the press and speech and its cantonese-language  media have a substantial exposure and following in the place of local cantonese language and culture remains contentious  a 2010  proposal to switch some programming on guangzhou television from cantonese to mandarin was abandoned following massive public protests  the largest since the tiananmen square protests of 1989.  as a major economic center of china  there have been recent concerns that the use of cantonese in guangzhou is diminishing in favour of mandarin  both through the continual influx of mandarin-speaking  migrants from poorer areas and strict government policies  as a result  cantonese is being given a more important status by the natives than ever before as a common identity of the local has historically served as a lingua franca among overseas chinese in southeast asia  who speak a variety of other forms of chinese including hokkien  teochew and additionally  cantonese media and pop culture from hong kong is popular throughout the region in vietnam  cantonese is the dominant language of the ethnic chinese community  usually referred to as hoa  which numbers about one million people and constitutes one of the largest minority groups in the over half of the ethnic chinese population in vietnam speaks cantonese as a native language and the variety also serves as a lingua franca between the different chinese dialect groups  many speakers reflect their exposure to vietnamese with a vietnamese accent or a tendency to code-switch  between cantonese and malaysia  cantonese is widely spoken amongst the malaysian chinese community in the capital city of kuala and the surrounding areas in the klang valley  petaling jaya  ampang  cheras  shah alam  kajang  bangi  selayang and subang jaya with a small minority in the town of klang   the dialect is also widely spoken in the state of perak  especially in the state capital city of ipoh  as well as in the eastern sabahan town of sandakan  although hokkien is the most spoken variety of chinese and mandarin is the medium of education at chinese-language  schools  cantonese is largely influential in the local chinese-language  media and is used in commerce by chinese to the popularity of hong kong popular culture  especially through drama series and popular music  cantonese is widely understood by the chinese in all parts of malaysia  even though a large proportion of the chinese malaysian population is non-cantonese.  television networks in malaysia regularly broadcast hong kong television programmes in their original cantonese audio and soundtrack  cantonese radio is also available in the nation and cantonese is prevalent in locally produced chinese singapore  mandarin is the official variety of the chinese language used by the government  which has a speak mandarin campaign  smc  seeking to actively promote the use of mandarin over other chinese varieties  cantonese is spoken by a little over 15%  of chinese households in singapore  despite the government s active promotion of smc  the cantonese-speaking  chinese community has had relative success in preserving its language against mandarin compared to other dialect all nationally produced non-mandarin  chinese tv and radio programs were stopped after the prime minister  lee kuan yew  then  also stopped giving speeches in hokkien to prevent giving conflicting signals to the hong kong  cantonese  and taiwanese dramas are unavailable in their untranslated form on free-to-air  television  though drama series in non-chinese  languages are available in their original languages  cantonese drama series on terrestrial tv channels are instead dubbed in mandarin and broadcast without the original cantonese audio and soundtrack  however  originals may be available through other sources such as cable television and online videos furthermore  an offshoot of smc is the translation to hanyu pinyin of certain terms which originated from southern chinese varieties  for instance  dim sum is often known as diǎn xīn in singapore s english-language  media  though this is largely a matter of style  and most singaporeans will refer to it as dim sum when speaking since the government restriction on media in non-mandarin  varieties was relaxed in the mid-1990s  and 2000s,  the presence of cantonese in singapore has grown substantially  forms of popular culture from hong kong  such as television series  cinema and pop music have become popular in singaporean society  and non-dubbed  original versions of the media became widely available  consequently  there has been a large of number of non-cantonese  chinese singaporeans being able to understand or speak cantonese to some varying extent  with a number of educational institutes offering cantonese as an elective language is widely used as the inter-communal  language among chinese cambodians  especially in phnom penh and other urban areas  while teochew speakers form the majority of the chinese population in cambodia  cantonese is often used as a vernacular in commerce and with other chinese variant groups in the chinese-language  schools in cambodia are conducted in both  cantonese and mandarin  but it always depends on the is home to the largest overseas chinese community in the world  numbering over 9  million individuals  cantonese is the fourth most-spoken  variety of chinese in thai chinese households after teochew  hakka and however  within the thai chinese commercial sector  it serves as a common language alongside teochew or thai  chinese-language  schools in thailand have also traditionally been conducted in cantonese  furthermore  cantonese serves as the lingua franca with other chinese communities in the indonesia  cantonese is locally known as konghu and is one of the variants spoken by the chinese indonesian community  with speakers largely concentrated in major cities such as jakarta  the capital city   medan and batam  however  it has a relatively minor presence compared to other southeast asian nations  being the fourth most spoken chinese variety after hokkien  hakka and teochew  a period of 150  years  guangdong has been the place-of-origin  for most chinese emigrants to western nations  one coastal county  taishan  or tóisàn  where the sìyì or sei yap variety of yue is spoken   alone may be the origin of the vast majority of chinese immigrants to the u s  before as a result  yue languages such as cantonese and the closely related variety of taishanese have been the major chinese varieties traditionally spoken in the united states the zhongshan variant of cantonese  with origins in the western pearl river delta  is spoken by many chinese immigrants in hawaii  and some in san francisco and the sacramento river delta  see locke  california   it is a yuehai variety much like guangzhou cantonese  but has  flatter  tones  chinese is the third most widely spoken non-english  language in the united states when both cantonese and mandarin are combined  behind spanish and many institutes of higher education have traditionally had chinese programs based on cantonese  with some continuing to offer these programs despite the rise of mandarin  the most popular romanization for learning cantonese in the united states is yale romanization the majority of chinese emigrants have traditionally originated from guangdong and guangxi  as well as hong kong and macao  beginning in the latter half of the 20th  century and before the handover  and southeast asia  with cantonese as their native language  however  more recent immigrants are arriving from the rest of mainland china and taiwan and most often speak standard mandarin  putonghua  as their native although some may also speak their native local variety  such as shanghainese  hokkien  fuzhounese  hakka  etc  as a result  mandarin is becoming more common among the chinese american community the increase of mandarin-speaking  communities has resulted in the rise of separate neighborhoods or enclaves segregated by the primary chinese variety spoken  socioeconomic statuses are also a factor as for example  in new york city  cantonese still predominates in the city s older  traditional western portion of chinatown in manhattan  in brooklyn s small new chinatowns in sections of bensonhurst and in homecrest  the newly emerged little fuzhou eastern portion of manhattan s chinatown and brooklyn s main large chinatown in and around sunset park are mostly populated by fuzhounese speakers  who often speak mandarin as well  the cantonese and fuzhounese enclaves in new york city are more working class  flushing s large chinatown  which now holds the crown as the largest chinatown of the city and elmhurst s smaller chinatown in queens are very mixed with large numbers of mandarin speakers from many different parts of china and taiwan  they comprise the primary cultural center for new york city s chinese population and are more middle northern california  especially in the san francisco bay area  cantonese has historically and continues to predominate in the chinatowns of san francisco and oakland  as well as the surrounding suburbs and metropolitan area  although mandarin is also found in silicon valley  in contrast  southern california hosts a much larger mandarin-speaking  population  with cantonese found in more historical chinese communities such as that of chinatown  los angeles and older chinese ethnoburbs such as san gabriel  rosemead and temple a number of more-established  taiwanese immigrants have learned cantonese to foster relations with the traditional cantonese-speaking  chinese american population  more recent arrivals and the larger number of mainland chinese immigrants have largely continued to use mandarin as the exclusive variety of chinese  this has led to a linguistic discrimination that has also contributed to social conflicts between the two sides  with a growing number of chinese americans  including american-born  chinese  of cantonese background defending the historic chinese american culture against the impacts of increasing mandarin-speaking  new is the second most common chinese variety spoken among chinese canadians  according to the canada 2016  census  there were 565,275  canadian residents who reported cantonese as their native language as in the united states  the chinese canadian community traces its roots to early immigrants from guangdong during the latter half of the 19th  later chinese immigrants came from hong kong in two waves  first in the late 1960s  to mid 1970s,  and again in the 1980s  to late 1990s  on fears arising from the impending handover to the people s republic of china  chinese-speaking  immigrants from conflict zones in southeast asia  especially vietnam  arrived as well  beginning in the mid-1970s  and were also largely cantonese-speaking.  unlike the united states  recent immigration from mainland china and taiwan to canada has been small  and cantonese still remains the predominant chinese variety in the overwhelming majority of chinese speakers in the united kingdom use cantonese  with about 300,000  british people claiming it as their first this is largely due to the presence of british hong kongers and the fact that many british chinese also have origins in the former british colonies in southeast asia of singapore and malaysia among the chinese community in france  cantonese is spoken by immigrants who fled the former french indochina  vietnam  cambodia and laos  following the conflicts and communist takeovers in the region during the 1970s.  while a slight majority of ethnic chinese from indochina speak teochew at home  knowledge of cantonese is prevalent due to its historic prestige status in the region and is used for commercial and community purposes between the different chinese variety groups  as in the united states  there is a divide between cantonese-speakers  and those speaking other mainland chinese is spoken by ethnic chinese in portugal who originate from macau  the most established chinese community in the nation with a presence dating back to the 16th  century and portuguese colonialism  since the late-20th  century however  mandarin and wu-speaking  migrants from mainland china have outnumbered those from macau  although cantonese is still retained among mainstream chinese community has traditionally been the dominant chinese language of the chinese australian community since the first ethnic chinese settlers arrived in the 1850s.  it maintained this status until the mid-2000s,  when a heavy increase in immigration from mandarin-speakers  largely from mainland china led to mandarin surpassing cantonese as the dominant chinese dialect spoken  cantonese is the third most spoken language in australia  in the 2011  census  the australian bureau of statistics listed 336,410  and 263,673  speakers of mandarin and cantonese  respectively during the southern song period  guangzhou became the cultural center of the cantonese emerged as the prestige variety of yue chinese when the port city of guangzhou on the pearl river delta became the largest port in china  with a trade network stretching as far as cantonese was also used in the popular yuè ōu  mùyú and nányīn folksong genres  as well as cantonese additionally  a distinct classical literature was developed in cantonese  with middle chinese texts sounding more similar to modern cantonese than other present-day  chinese varieties  including guangzhou became china s key commercial center for foreign trade and exchange in the 1700s,  cantonese became the variety of chinese interacting with most with the western around this period and continuing into the 1900s,  the ancestors of most of the population of hong kong and macau arrived from guangzhou and surrounding areas after they were ceded to britain and portugal  a popular urban legend claims that after the xinhai revolution of 1912,  cantonese almost became the official language of the republic of china but lost by just one mainland china  standard chinese  based on mandarin  has been heavily promoted as the medium of instruction in schools and as the official language  especially after the communist takeover in 1949.  meanwhile  cantonese has remained the official variety of chinese in hong kong and macau  both during and after the colonial chinese has numerous regional and local varieties  many of which are mutually unintelligible  most of these are rare outside their native areas  though they may be spoken outside of china  since a 1909  qing dynasty decree  china has promoted mandarin for use in education  the media and official the proclamation of mandarin as the official national language however  was not fully accepted by the cantonese authorities in the early 20th  century  who argued for the  regional uniqueness  of their own local language and commercial importance of the unlike other non-mandarin  chinese varieties  cantonese persists in a few state television and radio broadcasts today nevertheless  there have been recent attempts to minimize the use of cantonese in china  the most notable has been the 2010  proposal that guangzhou television increase its broadcast in mandarin at the expense of cantonese programs  this however led to protests in guangzhou  which eventually dissuaded authorities from going forward with the additionally  there are reports of students being punished for speaking other chinese languages at school  resulting in a reluctance of younger children to communicate in their native languages  including such actions have further provoked cantonese speakers to cherish their linguistic identity in contrast to migrants who have generally arrived from poorer areas of china and largely speak mandarin or other chinese to the linguistic history of hong kong and macau  and the use of cantonese in many established overseas chinese communities  diaspora speakers of cantonese is numerous compared to speakers residing in china  cantonese is the predominant chinese variety spoken in hong kong and macau  in these areas  public discourse takes place almost exclusively in cantonese  making it the only variety of chinese other than mandarin to be used as an official language in the world  because of their dominance in chinese diaspora overseas  standard cantonese and its dialect taishanese are among the most common chinese languages that one may encounter in the west increasingly since the 1997  handover  cantonese has been used as a symbol of local identity in hong kong  largely through the development of democracy in the territory and desinicization practices to emphasise a separate hong kong similar identity issue exists in the united states  where conflicts have arisen for the chinese speakers due to a large recent influx of mandarin-speakers.  while older taiwanese immigrants have learned cantonese to foster integration within the traditional chinese american populations  more recent arrivals from the mainland continue to use mandarin exclusively  this has contributed to a segregation of communities based on linguistic cleavage  in particular  some chinese americans  including american-born  chinese  of cantonese background emphasise their non-mainland  origins e g  hong kong  macau  vietnam  etc   to assert their identity in the face of new waves of with mandarin and hokkien  cantonese has its own popular music  cantopop  which is the predominant genre in hong kong  many artists from the mainland and taiwan have learned cantonese to break into the popular native mandarin-speaking  singers  including faye wong  eric moo  and singers from taiwan  have been trained in cantonese to add  hong kong-ness"  to their films date to the early days of chinese cinema  and the first cantonese talkie  white gold dragon  白金龍   was made in 1932  by the tianyi film despite a ban on cantonese films by the nanjing authority in the 1930s,  cantonese film production continued in hong kong which was then under british colonial from the mid-1970s  to the 1990s,  cantonese films made in hong kong were very popular in the chinese speaking world the de facto standard pronunciation of cantonese is that of canton  guangzhou   which is described in the cantonese phonology article  hong kong cantonese has some minor variations in phonology  but is largely identical to standard guangzhou cantonese in hong kong and macau  certain phoneme pairs have caused one sound to merge into another  although termed as  lazy sound   懶音  and considered substandard to guangzhou pronunciation  the phenomenon has been widespread in the territories since the early 20th  century  the most notable difference between hong kong and guangzhou pronunciation is the substitution of the liquid nasal   l   for the nasal initial   n   in many an example of this is manifested in the word for you  你   pronounced as néih in guangzhou and as léih in hong kong another key feature of hong kong cantonese is the merging of the two syllabic nasals  ŋ̩  and  m̩   this can be exemplified in the elimination of the contrast of sounds between 吳  ng  a surname  (ng4/ǹgh  in guangzhou pronunciation  and 唔  not  (mh4/m̀h  in guangzhou pronunciation   in hong kong  both words are pronounced as the the initials  kʷ  and  kʷʰ  can be merged into  k  and  kʰ  when followed by  ɔː   an example is in the word for country  國   pronounced in standard guangzhou as gwok but as gok with the merge  unlike the above two differences  this merge is found alongside the standard pronunciation in hong kong rather than being replaced  educated speakers often stick to the standard pronunciation but can exemplify the merged pronunciation in casual speech  in contrast  less educated speakers pronounce the merge more prevalent  but still notable differences found among a number of hong kong speakers include cantonese vowels tend to be traced further back to middle chinese back than their mandarin analogues  such as m   aɪ  vs  c   ɔːi   m   i  vs  c   ɐi   m   ɤ  vs  c   ɔː   m   ɑʊ  vs  c   ou  etc  for consonants  some differences include m   ɕ  tɕ  tɕʰ  vs  c   h  k  kʰ   m   ʐ  vs  c   j   and a greater syllable coda diversity in cantonese  such as syllables ending in -t,  -p,  or -k).generally  speaking  cantonese is a tonal language with six phonetic tones historically  finals that end in a stop consonant were considered as  checked tones  and treated separately by diachronic convention  identifying cantonese with nine tones  however  phonetically these are now considered a conflation of tone and final consonant and are seldom counted as individual tones in modern cantonese is used primarily in hong kong  macau  and other overseas chinese communities  it is usually written with traditional chinese characters  however  it includes extra characters as well as characters with different meanings from written vernacular chinese due to the presence of words that either do not exist in standard chinese or correspond with spoken cantonese  this system of written cantonese is often found in colloquial contexts such as entertainment magazines and social media  as well as on advertisements in contrast  standard written chinese continues to be used in formal literature  professional and government documents  and news media  nevertheless  colloquial characters may be present in formal written communications such as legal testimonies and newspapers when an individual is being quoted  rather than paraphrasing spoken cantonese into standard written chinese cantonese romanization systems are based on the accent of canton and hong kong  and have helped define the concept of standard cantonese  the major systems are meyer–wempe  the chinese government s guangdong romanization  yale and jyutping  while they do not differ greatly  yale is the one most commonly seen in the west needed  the hong kong linguist sidney lau modified the yale system for his popular cantonese-as-a-second-language  course and is still widely in use today  the cantonese romanization systems of macau are slightly different from hong kong s  the spellings are basically influenced by the portuguese language  however  some words under the macau s romanization systems are same as hong kong s  e g  lam 林  chan 陳   words with the alphabet  u  under hong kong s romanization systems are often replaced by  o  under macao s romanization systems  e g  chau vs chao 周  leung vs leong 梁   both the spellings of hong kong and macao cantonese romanization systems do not look similar to the mainland china s pinyin system  generally  plain stops are written with voiced consonants   p    t    ts   and  k  as b  d  z j  and g respectively   and aspirated stops with unvoiced ones  as in pinyin and icelandic systematic efforts to develop an alphabetic representation of cantonese began with the arrival of protestant missionaries in china early in the nineteenth century  romanization was considered both a tool to help new missionaries learn the variety more easily and a quick route for the unlettered to achieve gospel literacy  earlier catholic missionaries  mostly portuguese  had developed romanization schemes for the pronunciation current in the court and capital city of china but made few efforts to romanize other varieties robert morrison  the first protestant missionary in china published a  vocabulary of the canton dialect  (1828)  with a rather unsystematic romanized pronunciation  elijah coleman bridgman and samuel wells williams in their  chinese chrestomathy in the canton dialect  (1841)  were the progenitors of a long-lived  lineage of related romanizations with minor variations embodied in the works of james dyer ball  ernst johann eitel  and immanuel gottlieb genăhr (1910).  bridgman and williams based their system on the phonetic alphabet and diacritics proposed by sir william jones for south asian languages their romanization system embodied the phonological system in a local dialect rhyme dictionary  the fenyun cuoyao  which was widely used and easily available at the time and is still available today  samuel wells willams  tonic dictionary of the chinese language in the canton dialect  yinghua fenyun cuoyao 1856),  is an alphabetic rearrangement  translation and annotation of the fenyun  to adapt the system to the needs of users at a time when there were only local variants and no standard—although the speech of the western suburbs  xiguan  of guangzhou was the prestige variety at the time—williams suggested that users learn and follow their teacher s pronunciation of his chart of cantonese syllables  it was apparently bridgman s innovation to mark the tones with an open circle  upper register tones  or an underlined open circle  lower register tones  at the four corners of the romanized word in analogy with the traditional chinese system of marking the tone of a character with a circle  lower left for  even   upper left for  rising   upper right for  going   and lower right for  entering  tones  john chalmers  in his  english and cantonese pocket-dictionary"  (1859)  simplified the marking of tones using the acute accent to mark  rising  tones and the grave to mark  going  tones and no diacritic for  even  tones and marking upper register tones by italics  or underlining in handwritten work    entering  tones could be distinguished by their consonantal ending  nicholas belfeld dennys used chalmers romanization in his primer  this method of marking tones was adopted in the yale romanization  with low register tones marked with an  h    a new romanization was developed in the first decade of the twentieth century which eliminated the diacritics on vowels by distinguishing vowel quality by spelling differences  e g  a aa  o oh   diacritics were used only for marking tones the name of tipson is associated with this new romanization which still embodied the phonology of the fenyun to some extent  it is the system used in meyer-wempe  and cowles  dictionaries and o melia s textbook and many other works in the first half of the twentieth century  it was the standard romanization until the yale system supplanted it  the distinguished linguist y  r  chao developed a cantonese adaptation of his gwoyeu romatzyh system  the barnett-chao  romanization system was first used in chao s cantonese primer  published in 1947  by harvard university press  the cantonese primer was adapted for mandarin teaching and published by harvard university press in 1948  as mandarin primer   the bc system was also used in textbooks published by the hong kong government an influential work on cantonese  a chinese syllabary pronounced according to the dialect of canton  written by wong shik ling  was published in 1941.  he derived an ipa-based  transcription system  the s  l  wong system  used by many chinese dictionaries later published in hong kong  although wong also derived a romanization scheme  also known as the s  l  wong system  it is not widely used as his transcription scheme  this system was preceded by the barnett–chao system used by the hong government language school the romanization advocated by the linguistic society of hong kong  lshk  is called jyutping  the phonetic values of some consonants are closer to the approximate equivalents in ipa than in other systems  some effort has been undertaken to promote jyutping  but the success of its proliferation within the region has yet to be examined another popular scheme is cantonese pinyin  which is the only romanization system accepted by hong kong education and manpower bureau and hong kong examinations and assessment authority  books and studies for teachers and students in primary and secondary schools usually use this scheme  but there are teachers and students who use the transcription system of s l  wong despite the efforts to standardize cantonese romanization  those learning the language may feel frustrated that most native cantonese speakers  regardless of their level of education  are unfamiliar with any romanization system  because cantonese is primarily a spoken language and does not carry its own writing system  written cantonese  despite having some chinese characters unique to it  primarily follows modern standard chinese  which is closely tied to mandarin   it is not taught in schools  as a result  locals do not learn any of these systems  in contrast with mandarin-speaking  areas of china  cantonese romanization systems are excluded in the education systems of both hong kong and the guangdong province  in practice  hong kong follows a loose  unnamed romanization scheme used by the government of hong kong google cantonese input uses yale  jyutping or cantonese pinyin  yale being the first between the three main standards are in bold life in hong kong is characterized by the blending of asian  mainly south chinese  and western influences  as well as the status of the city as a major international business center  influences from this territory are widespread in foreign cultures  as a result  many loanwords are created and exported to china  taiwan  and singapore  some of the loanwords are even more popular than their chinese counterparts  at the same time  some new words created are vividly borrowed by other languages as well many mandarin words originally of foreign origin come from varieties which borrowed them from the original foreign language  the mandarin word  ningmeng   檸檬   meaning  lemon   originated from cantonese  in which the characters are pronounced as  lìng cited
