 an outflow boundary  also known as a gust front  is a storm-scale  or mesoscale boundary separating thunderstorm-cooled  air  outflow  from the surrounding air  similar in effect to a cold front  with passage marked by a wind shift and usually a drop in temperature and a related pressure jump  outflow boundaries can persist for 24  hours or more after the thunderstorms that generated them dissipate  and can travel hundreds of kilometers from their area of origin  new thunderstorms often develop along outflow boundaries  especially near the point of intersection with another boundary  cold front  dry line  another outflow boundary  etc    outflow boundaries can be seen either as fine lines on weather radar imagery or else as arcs of low clouds on weather satellite imagery  from the ground  outflow boundaries can be co-located  with the appearance of roll clouds and shelf boundaries create low-level  wind shear which can be hazardous during aircraft takeoffs and landings  if a thunderstorm runs into an outflow boundary  the low-level  wind shear from the boundary can cause thunderstorms to exhibit rotation at the base of the storm  at times causing tornadic activity  strong versions of these features known as downbursts can be generated in environments of vertical wind shear and mid-level  dry air  microbursts have a diameter of influence less than 4  kilometres (2.5  mi   while macrobursts occur over a diameter greater than 4  kilometres (2.5  mi   wet microbursts occur in atmospheres where the low levels are saturated  while dry microbursts occur in drier atmospheres from high-based  thunderstorms  when an outflow boundary moves into a more stable low level environment  such as into a region of cooler air or over regions of cooler water temperatures out at sea  it can lead to the development of an undular outflow boundary  also known as a gust front or arc cloud  is the leading edge of gusty  cooler surface winds from thunderstorm downdrafts  sometimes associated with a shelf cloud or roll cloud  a pressure jump is associated with its outflow boundaries can persist for over 24  hours and travel hundreds of kilometers  miles  from their area of a wrapping gust front is a front that wraps around the mesocyclone  cutting off the inflow of warm moist air and resulting in occlusion  this is sometimes the case during the event of a collapsing storm  in which the wind literally  rips it microburst is a very localized column of sinking air known as a downburst  producing damaging divergent and straight-line  winds at the surface that are similar to but distinguishable from tornadoes which generally have convergent the term was defined as affecting an area 4  kilometres (2.5  mi  in diameter or distinguishing them as a type of downburst and apart from common wind shear which can encompass greater areas  they are normally associated with individual thunderstorms  microburst soundings show the presence of mid-level  dry air  which enhances evaporative areas of thunderstorm activity reinforce pre-existing  frontal zones  and can outrun cold fronts  this outrunning occurs within the westerlies in a pattern where the upper level jet splits into two streams  the resultant mesoscale convective system  mcs  forms at the point of the upper level split in the wind pattern in the area of best low level inflow  the convection then moves east and toward the equator into the warm sector  parallel to low-level  thickness lines  when the convection is strong and linear or curved  the mcs is called a squall line  with the feature placed at the leading edge of the significant wind shift and pressure rise which is normally just ahead of its radar this feature is commonly depicted in the warm season across the united states on surface analyses  as they lie within sharp surface troughs a macroburst  normally associated with squall lines  is a strong downburst larger than 4  kilometres (2.5  a wet microburst consists of precipitation and an atmosphere saturated in the low-levels.  a dry microburst emanates from high-based  thunderstorms with virga falling from their all types are formed by precipitation-cooled  air rushing to the surface  downbursts can occur over large areas  in the extreme case  a derecho can cover a huge area more than 200  miles (320  km  wide and over 1,000  miles (1,600  km  long  lasting up to 12  hours or more  and is associated with some of the most intense straight-line  winds  but the generative process is somewhat different from that of most ground level  shelf clouds and roll clouds can be seen at the leading edge of outflow through satellite imagery  an arc cloud is visible as an arc of low clouds spreading out from a thunderstorm  if the skies are cloudy behind the arc  or if the arc is moving quickly  high wind gusts are likely behind the gust sometimes a gust front can be seen on weather radar  showing as a thin arc or line of weak radar echos pushing out from a collapsing storm  the thin line of weak radar echoes is known as a fine occasionally  winds caused by the gust front are so high in velocity that they also show up on radar  this cool outdraft can then energize other storms which it hits by assisting in updrafts  gust fronts colliding from two storms can even create new storms  usually  however  no rain accompanies the shifting winds  an expansion of the rain shaft near ground level  in the general shape of a human foot  is a telltale sign of a downburst  gustnadoes  short-lived  vertical circulations near ground level  can be spawned by outflow fronts create low-level  wind shear which can be hazardous to planes when they takeoff or flying insects are swept along by the prevailing as such  fine line patterns within weather radar imagery  associated with converging winds  are dominated by insect at the surface  clouds of dust can be raised by outflow boundaries  if squall lines form over arid regions  a duststorm known as a haboob can result from the high winds picking up dust in their wake from the desert if outflow boundaries move into areas of the atmosphere which are stable in the low levels  such as over colder pockets of ocean or through the cold sector of extratropical cyclones  they can create a phenomenon known as an undular bore  which shows up on satellite and radar imagery as a series of transverse waves in the cloud field oriented perpendicular to the low-level
