 behavioral modernity is a suite of behavioral and cognitive traits that distinguishes current homo sapiens from other anatomically modern humans  hominins  and primates  although often debated  most scholars agree that modern human behavior can be characterized by abstract thinking  planning depth  symbolic behavior  e g   art  ornamentation  music   exploitation of large game  and blade technology  among underlying these behaviors and technological innovations are cognitive and cultural foundations that have been documented experimentally and ethnographically  some of these human universal patterns are cumulative cultural adaptation  social norms  language  and extensive help and cooperation beyond close these traits have been viewed as largely responsible for the human replacement of neanderthals  along with the climatic conditions of the last glacial maximum  and the peopling of the rest of the from differences in the archaeological record  a debate continues as to whether anatomically modern humans were behaviorally modern as well  there are many theories on the evolution of behavioral modernity  these generally fall into two camps  gradualist and cognitive approaches  the later upper paleolithic model refers to the idea that modern human behavior arose through cognitive  genetic changes abruptly around 40,000–50,000  years other models focus on how modern human behavior may have arisen through gradual steps  the archaeological signatures of such behavior only appearing through demographic or subsistence-based  order to classify what traits should be included in modern human behavior  it is necessary to define behaviors that are universal among living human groups  some examples of these human universals are abstract thought  planning  trade  cooperative labor  body decoration  control and use of fire  along with these traits  humans possess a heavy reliance on social this cumulative cultural change or cultural  ratchet  separates human culture from social learning in animals  as well  a reliance on social learning may be responsible in part for humans  rapid adaptation to many environments outside of africa  since cultural universals are found in all cultures including some of the most isolated indigenous groups  these traits must have evolved or have been invented in africa prior to the a number of empirical traits have been used as indicators of modern human behavior  while these are often a few are generally agreed upon  archaeological evidence of behavioral modernity critiques have been placed against the traditional concept of behavioral modernity  both methodologically and shea (2011)  outlines a variety of problems with this concept  arguing instead for  behavioral variability   which  according to the author  better describes the archaeological record  the use of trait lists  according to shea (2011),  runs the risk of taphonomic bias  where some sites may yield more artifacts than others despite similar populations  as well  trait lists can be ambiguous in how behaviors may be empirically recognized in the archaeological shea (2011)  in particular cautions that population pressure  cultural change  or optimality models  like those in human behavioral ecology  might better predict changes in tool types or subsistence strategies than a change from  archaic  to  modern  some researchers argue that a greater emphasis should be placed on identifying only those artifacts which are unquestionably  or purely  symbolic as a metric for modern human late upper paleolithic model  or upper paleolithic revolution  refers to the idea that  though anatomically modern humans first appear around 150,000  years ago  they were not cognitively or behaviorally  modern  until around 50,000  years ago  leading to their expansion into europe and these authors note that traits used as a metric for behavioral modernity do not appear as a package until around 40–50,000  years ago  klein (1995)  specifically describes evidence of fishing  bone shaped as a tool  hearths  significant artifact diversity  and elaborate graves are all absent before this although assemblages before 50,000  years ago show some diversity the only distinctly modern tool assemblages appear in europe at according to these authors  art only becomes common beyond this switching point  signifying a change from archaic to modern most researchers argue that a neurological or genetic change  perhaps one enabling complex language  such as foxp2,  caused this revolutionary change in our with this view of a spontaneous leap in cognition among ancient humans  some authors like alison s  brooks  primarily working in african archaeology  point to the gradual accumulation of  modern  behaviors  starting well before the 50,000  year benchmark of the upper paleolithic revolution howiesons poort  blombos  and other south african archaeological sites  for example  show evidence of marine resource acquisition  trade  and abstract ornamentation at least by 80,000  years given evidence from africa and the middle east  a variety of hypotheses have been put forth to describe an earlier  gradual transition from simple to more complex human behavior  some authors have pushed back the appearance of fully modern behavior to around 80,000  years ago in order to incorporate the south african focus on the slow accumulation of different technologies and behaviors across time  these describe how anatomically modern humans could have been cognitively the same and what we define as behavioral modernity is just the result of thousands of years of cultural adaptation and learning  d errico and others have looked at neanderthal culture rather than early human behavior for clues into behavioral noting that neanderthal assemblages often portray traits similar to those listed for modern human behavior  researchers stress that the foundations for behavioral modernity may in fact lie deeper in our hominin if both modern humans and neanderthals express abstract art and complex tools then  modern human behavior  cannot be a derived trait for our species  they argue that the original  human revolution  theory reflects a profound eurocentric bias  recent archaeological evidence  they argue  proves that humans evolving in africa some 300,000  or even 400,000  years ago were already becoming cognitively and behaviourally  modern   these features include blade and microlithic technology  bone tools  increased geographic range  specialized hunting  the use of aquatic resources  long distance trade  systematic processing and use of pigment  and art and decoration  these items do not occur suddenly together as predicted by the ‘‘human revolution’’ model  but at sites that are widely separated in space and time  this suggests a gradual assembling of the package of modern human behaviours in africa  and its later export to other regions of the old world between these extremes is the view – currently supported by archaeologists chris curtis ian and others – that there was indeed some kind of  human revolution  but that it occurred in africa and spanned tens of thousands of years  the term  revolution  in this context would mean not a sudden mutation but a historical development along the lines of  the industrial revolution  or  the neolithic in other words  it was a relatively accelerated process  too rapid for ordinary darwinian  descent with modification  yet too gradual to be attributed to a single genetic or other sudden event  these archaeologists point in particular to the relatively explosive emergence of ochre crayons and shell necklaces apparently used for cosmetic purposes  these archaeologists see symbolic organisation of human social life as the key transition in modern human evolution  recently discovered at sites such as blombos cave and pinnacle point  south africa  pierced shells  pigments and other striking signs of personal ornamentation have been dated within a time-window  of 70,000  – 160,000  years ago in the african middle stone age  suggesting that the emergence of homo sapiens coincided  after all  with the transition to modern cognition and while viewing the emergence of language as a  revolutionary  development  this school of thought generally attributes it to cumulative social  cognitive and cultural evolutionary processes as opposed to a single genetic further view  taken by archaeologists such as francesco and joão is a multi-species  perspective arguing that evidence for symbolic culture in the form of utilised pigments and pierced shells are also found in neanderthal sites  independently of any  modern  human influence cultural evolutionary models may also shed light on why although evidence of behavioral modernity exists before 50,000  years ago it is not expressed consistently until that point  with small population sizes  human groups would have been affected by demographic and cultural evolutionary forces that may not have allowed for complex cultural according to some until population density became significantly high  complex traits could not have been maintained effectively  it is worth noting that some genetic evidence supports a dramatic increase in population size before human migration out of high local extinction rates within a population also can significantly decrease the amount of diversity in neutral cultural traits  regardless of cognitive speculatively --  bicameral mind theory argues for an additional  and cultural rather than genetic  shift from selfless to self-perceiving  forms of human cognition and behavior very late in human history  in the bronze age  this is based on a literary analysis of bronze age texts which claims to show the first appearances of the concept of self around this time  replacing the voices of gods as the primary form of recorded human cognition  this non-mainstream  theory is not widely accepted but does receive serious academic interest from time to time before the  out of africa  theory was generally accepted  there was no consensus on where the human species evolved and  consequently  where modern human behavior arose  now  however  african archaeology has become extremely important in discovering the origins of humanity  since human expansion into europe around 48,000  years ago is generally accepted as already the question becomes whether behavioral modernity appeared in africa well before 50,000  years ago  as a late upper paleolithic  revolution  which prompted migration out of africa  or arose outside africa and diffused back a variety of evidence of abstract imagery  widened subsistence strategies  and other  modern  behaviors have been discovered in africa  especially south africa  the blombos cave site in south africa  for example  is famous for rectangular slabs of ochre engraved with geometric designs  using multiple dating techniques  the site was confirmed to be around 77,000  years beads and other personal ornamentation have been found from morocco which might be as old as 130,000  years old  as well  the cave of hearths in south africa has yielded a number of beads significantly before 50,000  years subsistence strategies beyond big-game  hunting and the consequential diversity in tool types has been noted as signs of behavioral modernity  a number of south african sites have shown an early reliance on aquatic resources from fish to shellfish  pinnacle point  in particular  shows exploitation of marine resources as early as 120,000  years ago  perhaps in response to more arid conditions establishing a reliance on predictable shellfish deposits  for example  could reduce mobility and facilitate complex social systems and symbolic behavior  blombos cave and site 440  in sudan both show evidence of fishing as well  taphonomic change in fish skeletons from blombos cave have been interpreted as capture of live fish  clearly an intentional human traditionally described as evidence for the later upper paleolithic european archaeology has shown that the issue is more complex  a variety of stone tool technologies are present at the time of human expansion into europe and show evidence of modern behavior  despite the problems of conflating specific tools with cultural groups  the aurignacian tool complex  for example  is generally taken as a purely modern human the discovery of  transitional  complexes  like "proto-aurignacian",  have been taken as evidence of human groups progressing through  steps of if  as this might suggest  human groups were already migrating into eastern europe around 40,000  years and only afterward show evidence of behavioral modernity  then either the cognitive change must have diffused back into africa or was already present before migration in light of a growing body of evidence of neanderthal culture and tool complexes some researchers have put forth a  multiple species model  for behavioral neanderthals were often cited as being an evolutionary dead-end,  apish cousins who were less advanced than their human contemporaries  personal ornaments were relegated as trinkets or poor imitations compared to the cave art produced by h  sapiens  despite this  european evidence has shown a variety of personal ornaments and artistic artifacts produced by neanderthals  for example  the neanderthal site of grotte du renne has produced grooved bear  wolf  and fox incisors  ochre and other symbolic though burials are few and controversial  there has been circumstantial evidence of neanderthal ritual there are two options to describe this symbolic behavior among neanderthals  they copied cultural traits from arriving modern humans or they had their own cultural traditions comparative with behavioral modernity  if they just copied cultural traditions  which is debated by several they still possessed the capacity for complex culture described by behavioral modernity  as discussed above  if neanderthals also were  behaviorally modern  then it cannot be a species-specific  derived trait most debates surrounding behavioral modernity have been focused on africa or europe but an increasing amount of focus has been placed on east asia  this region offers a unique opportunity to test hypotheses of multi-regionalism,  replacement  and demographic unlike europe  where initial migration occurred around 50,000  years ago  human remains have been dated in china to around 100,000  years this early evidence of human expansion calls into question behavioral modernity as an impetus for migration stone tool technology is particularly of interest in east asia  following homo erectus migrations out of africa  acheulean technology never seems to appear beyond present-day  india and into china  analogously  mode 3,  or levallois technology  is not apparent in china following later hominin this lack of more advanced technology has been explained by serial founder effects and low population densities out of though tool complexes comparative to europe are missing or fragmentary  other archaeological evidence shows behavioral modernity  for example  the peopling of the japanese archipelago offers an opportunity to investigate the early use of watercraft  though one site  kanedori in honshu  does suggest the use of watercraft as early as 84,000  years ago  there is no other evidence of hominins in japan until 50,000  years zhoukoudian cave system near beijing has been excavated since the 1930s  and has yielded precious data on early human behavior in east asia  though disputed  there is evidence of possible human burials and interred remains in the cave dated to around 34-20,000  years these remains have associated personal ornaments in the form of beads and worked shell  suggesting symbolic behavior  along with possible burials  numerous other symbolic objects like punctured animal teeth and beads  some dyed in red ochre  have all been found at though fragmentary  the archaeological record of eastern asia shows evidence of behavioral modernity before 50,000  years ago but  like the african record  it is not fully apparent until that time
