 an abyssal plain is an underwater plain on the deep ocean floor  usually found at depths between 3,000  metres (9,800  ft  and 6,000  metres (20,000  ft   lying generally between the foot of a continental rise and a mid-ocean  ridge  abyssal plains cover more than 50%  of the earth’s they are among the flattest  smoothest and least explored regions on abyssal plains are key geologic elements of oceanic basins  the other elements being an elevated mid-ocean  ridge and flanking abyssal hills  the creation of the abyssal plain is the result of the spreading of the seafloor  plate tectonics  and the melting of the lower oceanic crust  magma rises from above the asthenosphere  a layer of the upper mantle   and as this basaltic material reaches the surface at mid-ocean  ridges  it forms new oceanic crust  which is constantly pulled sideways by spreading of the seafloor  abyssal plains result from the blanketing of an originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained  sediments  mainly clay and silt  much of this sediment is deposited by turbidity currents that have been channelled from the continental margins along submarine canyons into deeper water  the rest is composed chiefly of pelagic sediments  metallic nodules are common in some areas of the plains  with varying concentrations of metals  including manganese  iron  nickel  cobalt  and copper owing in part to their vast size  abyssal plains are believed to be major reservoirs of biodiversity  they also exert significant influence upon ocean carbon cycling  dissolution of calcium carbonate  and atmospheric co2  concentrations over time scales of a hundred to a thousand years  the structure of abyssal ecosystems are strongly influenced by the rate of flux of food to the seafloor and the composition of the material that settles  factors such as climate change  fishing practices  and ocean fertilization have a substantial effect on patterns of primary production in the euphotic plains were not recognized as distinct physiographic features of the sea floor until the late 1940s  and  until very recently  none had been studied on a systematic basis  they are poorly preserved in the sedimentary record  because they tend to be consumed by the subduction ocean can be conceptualized as being divided into various zones  depending on depth  and presence or absence of sunlight  nearly all life forms in the ocean depend on the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon  which is the basic building block of organic matter  photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic stratum of the water column nearest the surface of the ocean  sea level  is referred to as the photic zone  the photic zone can be subdivided into two different vertical regions  the uppermost portion of the photic zone  where there is adequate light to support photosynthesis by phytoplankton and plants  is referred to as the euphotic zone  also referred to as the epipelagic zone  or surface the lower portion of the photic zone  where the light intensity is insufficient for photosynthesis  is called the dysphotic zone  dysphotic means  poorly lit  in the dysphotic zone is also referred to as the mesopelagic zone  or the twilight its lowermost boundary is at a thermocline of 12  °c (54  °f   which  in the tropics generally lies between 200  and 1000  euphotic zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as extending from the surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1%  of surface sunlight irradiance  depending on season  latitude and degree of water in the clearest ocean water  the euphotic zone may extend to a depth of about 150  or rarely  up to 200  dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light  and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth  in such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or the dysphotic zone  where light intensity is considerably less than 1%  of surface irradiance  extends from the base of the euphotic zone to about 1000  extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the aphotic zone  a region of perpetual the average depth of the ocean is about 4300  the photic zone represents only a tiny fraction of the ocean’s total volume  however  due to its capacity for photosynthesis  the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and biomass of all oceanic zones  nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here  life forms which inhabit the aphotic zone are often capable of movement upwards through the water column into the photic zone for feeding  otherwise  they must rely on material sinking from or find another source of energy and nutrition  such as occurs in chemosynthetic archaea found near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps the aphotic zone can be subdivided into three different vertical regions  based on depth and temperature  first is the bathyal zone  extending from a depth of 1000  metres down to 3000  metres  with water temperature decreasing from 12  °c (54  °f  to 4  °c (39  °f  as depth next is the abyssal zone  extending from a depth of 3000  metres down to 6000  the final zone includes the deep oceanic trenches  and is known as the hadal zone  this  the deepest oceanic zone  extends from a depth of 6000  metres down to approximately 11000  abyssal plains are typically in the abyssal zone  at depths from 3000  to 6000  table below illustrates the classification of oceanic zones oceanic crust  which forms the bedrock of abyssal plains  is continuously being created at mid-ocean  ridges  a type of divergent boundary  by a process known as decompression plume-related  decompression melting of solid mantle is responsible for creating ocean islands like the hawaiian islands  as well as the ocean crust at mid-ocean  ridges  this phenomenon is also the most common explanation for flood basalts and oceanic plateaus  two types of large igneous provinces   decompression melting occurs when the upper mantle is partially melted into magma as it moves upwards under mid-ocean  this upwelling magma then cools and solidifies by conduction and convection of heat to form new oceanic crust  accretion occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a tectonic plate  usually associated with seafloor spreading  the age of oceanic crust is therefore a function of distance from the mid-ocean  the youngest oceanic crust is at the mid-ocean  ridges  and it becomes progressively older  cooler and denser as it migrates outwards from the mid-ocean  ridges as part of the process called mantle lithosphere  which rides atop the asthenosphere  is divided into a number of tectonic plates that are continuously being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries  oceanic crust and tectonic plates are formed and move apart at mid-ocean  ridges  abyssal hills are formed by stretching of the oceanic consumption or destruction of the oceanic lithosphere occurs at oceanic trenches  a type of convergent boundary  also known as a destructive plate boundary  by a process known as subduction  oceanic trenches are found at places where the oceanic lithospheric slabs of two different plates meet  and the denser  older  slab begins to descend back into the at the consumption edge of the plate  the oceanic trench   the oceanic lithosphere has thermally contracted to become quite dense  and it sinks under its own weight in the process of the subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere  so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200  million years the overall process of repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the supercontinent cycle  first proposed by canadian geophysicist and geologist john tuzo wilson new oceanic crust  closest to the mid-oceanic  ridges  is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography  the roughness of this topography is a function of the rate at which the mid-ocean  ridge is spreading  the spreading magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly  typical values for fast-spreading  ridges are greater than 100  mm yr  while slow-spreading  ridges are typically less than 20  studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate  the rougher the new oceanic crust will be  and vice it is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean  ridge when the new oceanic crust was these faults pervading the oceanic crust  along with their bounding abyssal hills  are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the the process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics the flat appearance of mature abyssal plains results from the blanketing of this originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained  sediments  mainly clay and silt  much of this sediment is deposited from turbidity currents that have been channeled from the continental margins along submarine canyons down into deeper water  the remainder of the sediment comprises chiefly dust  clay particles  blown out to sea from land  and the remains of small marine plants and animals which sink from the upper layer of the ocean  known as pelagic sediments  the total sediment deposition rate in remote areas is estimated at two to three centimeters per thousand sediment-covered  abyssal plains are less common in the pacific ocean than in other major ocean basins because sediments from turbidity currents are trapped in oceanic trenches that border the pacific plains are typically covered by very deep sea  but during parts of the messinian salinity crisis much of the mediterranean sea s abyssal plain was exposed to air as an empty hot dry salt-floored  landmark scientific expedition  december 1872  – may 1876)  of the british royal navy survey ship hms challenger yielded a tremendous amount of bathymetric data  much of which has been confirmed by subsequent researchers  bathymetric data obtained during the course of the challenger expedition enabled scientists to draw which provided a rough outline of certain major submarine terrain features  such as the edge of the continental shelves and the mid-atlantic  ridge  this discontinuous set of data points was obtained by the simple technique of taking soundings by lowering long lines from the ship to the challenger expedition was followed by the 1879–1881  expedition of the jeannette  led by united states navy lieutenant george washington delong  the team sailed across the chukchi sea and recorded meteorological and astronomical data in addition to taking soundings of the seabed  the ship became trapped in the ice pack near wrangel island in september 1879,  and was ultimately crushed and sunk in june jeannette expedition was followed by the 1893–1896  arctic expedition of norwegian explorer fridtjof nansen aboard the fram  which proved that the arctic ocean was a deep oceanic basin  uninterrupted by any significant land masses north of the eurasian in 1916,  canadian physicist robert william boyle and other scientists of the anti-submarine  detection investigation committee  asdic  undertook research which ultimately led to the development of sonar technology  acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines  thus enabling the german meteor expedition aboard the german research vessel meteor (1925–27)  to take frequent soundings on east-west  atlantic transects  maps produced from these techniques show the major atlantic basins  but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal technology improved  measurement of depth  latitude and longitude became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points  this allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of large areas of the ocean floor  use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled tolstoy   ewing in the summer of 1947  to identify and describe the first abyssal plain  this plain  south of newfoundland  is now known as the sohm abyssal following this discovery many other examples were found in all the challenger deep is the deepest surveyed point of all of earth s oceans  it is at the south end of the mariana trench near the mariana islands group  the depression is named after hms challenger  whose researchers made the first recordings of its depth on 23  march 1875  at station 225.  the reported depth was 4,475  fathoms (8184  meters  based on two separate soundings  on 1  june 2009,  sonar mapping of the challenger deep by the simrad em120  multibeam sonar bathymetry system aboard the r v kilo moana indicated a maximum depth of 10971  meters (6.82  miles   the sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection  with an accuracy of better than 0.2%  of water depth  this is an error of about 22  meters at this rare but important terrain feature found in the abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent  in contrast to the approximately 2  °c ambient water temperature at these depths  water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60  °c up to as high as 464  due to the high barometric pressure at these depths  water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures at a barometric pressure of 218  atmospheres  the critical point of water is 375  °c  at a depth of 3,000  meters  the barometric pressure of sea water is more than 300  atmospheres  as salt water is denser than fresh water   at this depth and pressure  seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407  °c  see image   however the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point  thus  water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents  black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid  possessing physical properties between

temperatures of up to 407  °c were recorded at one of these vents  with a peak recorded temperature of up to 464  °c  these thermodynamic conditions exceed the critical point of seawater  and are the highest temperatures recorded to date from the seafloor  this is the first reported evidence for direct magmatic-hydrothermal  interaction on a slow-spreading  mid-ocean  unusual feature found in the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep  sometimes called a cold vent  this is an area of the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide  methane and other hydrocarbon-rich  fluid occurs  often in the form of a deep-sea  brine pool  the first cold seeps were discovered in 1983,  at a depth of 3200  meters in the gulf of since then  cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the world ocean  including the monterey submarine canyon just off monterey bay  california  the sea of japan  off the pacific coast of costa rica  off the atlantic coast of africa  off the coast of alaska  and under an ice shelf in the plains were once assumed to be vast  desert-like  habitats  research over the past decade or so shows that they teem with a wide variety of microbial however  ecosystem structure and function at the deep seafloor have historically been very poorly studied because of the size and remoteness of the abyss  recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the census of diversity of abyssal marine life  cedamar  have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains  with up to 2000  species of bacteria  250  species of protozoans  and 500  species of invertebrates  worms  crustaceans and molluscs   typically found at single abyssal new species make up more than 80%  of the thousands of seafloor invertebrate species collected at any abyssal station  highlighting our heretofore poor understanding of abyssal diversity and richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher organic carbon galatheae  a species of cusk eel in the family ophidiidae  is among the deepest-living  species of fish  in 1970,  one specimen was trawled from a depth of 8370  meters in the puerto rico the animal was dead  however  upon arrival at the surface  in 2008,  the hadal snailfish  pseudoliparis was observed and recorded at a depth of 7700  meters in the japan trench  these are  to date  the deepest living fish ever other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the ipnopidae family  which includes the abyssal spiderfish  bathypterois longipes   tripodfish  bathypterois grallator   feeler fish  bathypterois longifilis   and the black lizardfish  bathysauropsis gracilis   some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000  scientists have demonstrated that some abyssal and hadal species have a cosmopolitan distribution  one example of this would be protozoan certain species of which are distributed from the arctic to the antarctic  other faunal groups  such as the polychaete worms and isopod crustaceans  appear to be endemic to certain specific plains and many apparently unique taxa of nematode worms have also been recently discovered on abyssal plains  this suggests that the very deep ocean has fostered adaptive the taxonomic composition of the nematode fauna in the abyssal pacific is similar  but not identical to  that of the north a list of some of the species that have been discovered or redescribed by cedamar can be found here eleven of the 31  described species of monoplacophora  a class of mollusks  live below 2000  meters  of these 11  species  two live exclusively in the hadal the greatest number of monoplacophorans are from the eastern pacific ocean along the oceanic trenches  however  no abyssal monoplacophorans have yet been found in the western pacific and only one abyssal species has been identified in the indian of the 922  known species of chitons  from the polyplacophora class of mollusks   22  species (2.4%)  are reported to live below 2000  meters and two of them are restricted to the abyssal although genetic studies are lacking  at least six of these species are thought to be eurybathic  capable of living in a wide range of depths   having been reported as occurring from the sublittoral to abyssal depths  a large number of the polyplacophorans from great depths are herbivorous or xylophagous  which could explain the difference between the distribution of monoplacophorans and polyplacophorans in the world s crustaceans  including isopods  are known to form a significant part of the macrobenthic community that is responsible for scavenging on large food falls onto the sea in 2000,  scientists of the diversity of the deep atlantic

of the angola basin in the south atlantic in 2003,  de broyer et al  collected some 68,000  peracarid crustaceans from 62  species from baited traps deployed in the weddell sea  scotia sea  and off the south shetland islands  they found that about 98%  of the specimens belonged to the amphipod superfamily lysianassoidea  and 2%  to the isopod family cirolanidae  half of these species were collected from depths of greater than 1000  2005,  the japan agency for marine-earth  science and technology  jamstec  remotely operated vehicle  kaiko  collected sediment core from the challenger deep  432  living specimens of soft-walled  foraminifera were identified in the sediment foraminifera are single-celled  protists that construct shells  there are an estimated 4,000  species of living foraminifera  out of the 432  organisms collected  the overwhelming majority of the sample consisted of simple  soft-shelled  foraminifera  with others representing species of the complex  multi-chambered  genera leptohalysis and reophax  overall  85%  of the specimens consisted of soft-shelled  allogromids  this is unusual compared to samples of sediment-dwelling  organisms from other deep-sea  environments  where the percentage of organic-walled  foraminifera ranges from 5%  to 20%  of the total  small organisms with hard calciferous shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because the water at that depth is severely lacking in calcium similar lifeforms have been known to exist in shallower oceanic trenches (>7,000  m  and on the abyssal plain  the lifeforms discovered in the challenger deep may represent independent taxa from those shallower ecosystems  this preponderance of soft-shelled  organisms at the challenger deep may be a result of selection pressure  millions of years ago  the challenger deep was shallower than it is now  over the past six to nine million years  as the challenger deep grew to its present depth  many of the species present in the sediment of that ancient biosphere were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment  those species that were able to adapt may have been the ancestors of the organisms currently endemic to the challenger occur throughout the earth s oceans at all depths  from forms that live as plankton near the surface  to the deepest oceanic trenches  the robot ocean probe nereus observed a 2–3  cm specimen  still unclassified  of polychaete at the bottom of the challenger deep on 31  may there are more than 10,000  described species of polychaetes  they can be found in nearly every marine environment  some species live in the coldest ocean temperatures of the hadal zone  while others can be found in the extremely hot waters adjacent to hydrothermal vents within the abyssal and hadal zones  the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have by far the greatest biomass and biodiversity per unit area  fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids  these areas are often home to large and diverse communities of thermophilic  halophilic and other extremophilic prokaryotic microorganisms  such as those of the sulfide-oxidizing  beggiatoa genus   often arranged in large bacterial mats near cold seeps  in these locations  chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria typically form the base of the food chain  although the process of chemosynthesis is entirely microbial  these chemosynthetic microorganisms often support vast ecosystems consisting of complex multicellular organisms through these communities are characterized by species such as vesicomyid clams  mytilid mussels  limpets  isopods  giant tube worms  soft corals  eelpouts  galatheid crabs  and alvinocarid shrimp  the deepest seep community discovered thus far is in the japan trench  at a depth of 7700  the most important ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation  abyssal seafloor communities are considered to be food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the euphotic zone  thousands of meters most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles  typically  only 0.5–2%  of net primary production in the euphotic zone   which decreases inversely with water the small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental addition to their high biodiversity  abyssal plains are of great current and future commercial and strategic interest  for example  they may be used for the legal and illegal disposal of large structures such as ships and oil rigs  radioactive waste and other hazardous waste  such as munitions  they may also be attractive sites for deep-sea  fishing  and extraction of oil and gas and other minerals  future deep-sea  waste disposal activities that could be significant by 2025  include emplacement of sewage and sludge  carbon-dioxide  sequestration  and disposal of dredge fish stocks dwindle in the upper ocean  deep-sea  fisheries are increasingly being targeted for exploitation  because deep sea fish are long-lived  and slow growing  these deep-sea  fisheries are not thought to be sustainable in the long term given current management changes in primary production in the photic zone are expected to alter the standing stocks in the food-limited  aphotic zone hydrocarbon exploration in deep water occasionally results in significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings  but also from oil spills  while the oil gusher involved in the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500  meters below the ocean it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that can result from mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas sediments of certain abyssal plains contain abundant mineral resources  notably polymetallic nodules  these potato-sized  concretions of manganese  iron  nickel  cobalt  and copper  distributed on the seafloor at depths of greater than 4000  are of significant commercial interest  the area of maximum commercial interest for polymetallic nodule mining  called the pacific nodule province  lies in international waters of the pacific ocean  stretching from 118°–157°,  and from 9°–16°n,  an area of more than 3  million the abyssal clarion-clipperton  fracture zone  ccfz  is an area within the pacific nodule province that is currently under exploration for its mineral commercial contractors are currently licensed by the international seabed authority  an intergovernmental organization established to organize and control all mineral-related  activities in the international seabed area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas  each covering 150,000  when mining ultimately begins  each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800  km² of seafloor per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5–10  times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments  thus  over the 15-year  projected duration of a single mining operation  nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000  to 45,000  km²  a zone at least the size of knowledge of the taxonomy  biogeography and natural history of deep sea communities prevents accurate assessment of the risk of species extinctions from large-scale  mining  data acquired from the abyssal north pacific and north atlantic suggest that deep-sea  ecosystems may be adversely affected by mining operations on decadal time in 1978,  a dredge aboard the hughes glomar explorer  operated by the american mining consortium ocean minerals company  omco   made a mining track at a depth of 5000  meters in the nodule fields of the ccfz  in 2004,  the french research institute for exploitation of the sea  ifremer  conducted the nodinaut expedition to this mining track  which is still visible on the seabed  to study the long-term  effects of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its benthic fauna  samples taken of the superficial sediment revealed that its physical and chemical properties had not shown any recovery since the disturbance made 26  years earlier  on the other hand  the biological activity measured in the track by instruments aboard the manned submersible bathyscaphe nautile did not differ from a nearby unperturbed site  this data suggests that the benthic fauna and nutrient fluxes at the water–sediment interface has fully
