 hurricane grace was a short-lived  category 2  hurricane that contributed to the formation of the powerful 1991  perfect storm  forming on october 26,  grace initially had subtropical origins  meaning it was partially tropical and partially extratropical in nature  it became a tropical cyclone on october 27,  and ultimately peaked with winds of 90  knots (105  mph  165  km h   the storm had minor effects on the island of bermuda as it passed to the south  a developing extratropical storm to the north turned grace eastward  the hurricane was eventually absorbed into the large circulation of the larger low pressure fed by the contrast between cold air to the northwest and warm air from the remnants of hurricane grace  this storm became a large and powerful nor easter that caused extremely high waves and resulted in severe coastal damage along the east coast of the united states the origins of grace go back to a mid-level  area of low pressure that formed on october 23  to the south of bermuda  reports from a nearby ship indicated that the low had become a surface feature by october 25.  the storm system initially contained subtropical characteristics  and the center of circulation lacked deep convection for several days  the system was designated a subtropical storm on october 26.  an area of clouds near bermuda became increasingly convective  and gradually became entrained into the expanding and developing circulation of the subtropical storm  thunderstorm activity persisted near the center  and on october 27,  the storm attained tropical storm status and was named continued to organize and intensify  based on satellite intensity estimates and reconnaissance reports  the storm was upgraded to a category 1  hurricane  the lowest level on the saffirâ€“simpson hurricane grace reached its peak intensity with winds of 90  knots (105  mph  165  km h  and a minimum central barometric pressure of 980  mbar  hpa  28.94  inhg   ranking as a category operationally  however  the peak intensity was thought to have been 65  knots (75  mph  120  km h   which would have made it a mere category 1  at its peak the hurricane tracked generally northwestward until october 28,  when an extratropical cyclone formed along an approaching cold front off the new england coast  this storm rapidly intensified and influenced grace s steering currents  turning the hurricane sharply at around the same time  an eye feature associated with hurricane grace became apparent on satellite imagery  despite a lack of strong convective activity around the storm s grace accelerated as it continued eastward  and reached its peak intensity of category 2  status on october 29.  however  the storm s rapid forward movement led to an asymmetrical circulation  the center passed approximately 50  mi (80  km  south of bermuda without significantly affecting the grace turned northeast later that day  as the rapidly approaching cold front undermined the storm s lower-level  center  the system became overtaken by the front and subsequently lost its status as a tropical it moved north along the front and merged with the large cyclone to the the remnants of grace became completely indistinguishable by the next day as it was completely absorbed by the passing extratropical storm on october the nor easter significantly strengthened as a result of the temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity associated with the remnants of hurricane grace  the low-pressure  system continued deepening as it drifted southeastward and then southwestward towards the united states  the cyclone attained its peak intensity 390  miles (630  km  south of halifax  nova scotia  with winds of up to 60  knots (69  mph  110  km h   the storm became known as the 1991  perfect storm  or more commonly  the  perfect advance of hurricane grace  a tropical storm warning was issued for bermuda on october 27.  the following day  about 10  hours before the storm s closest approach to the island  the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning  on october 29,  the hurricane warning was lowered to a tropical storm warning  which was amended to a gale warning shortly the island experienced bands of squally weather in association with the precipitation peaked at 3.21  in (82  however  no significant damage was a yacht traveling from bermuda to new york encountered strong winds and 25  ft (7.6  m  seas well off the virginia coast  its nine occupants were rescued by coast guard of its large size  grace generated large swells along the east coast of the united combined with abnormally high tides  these waves reached at least 15  ft (4.6  m   despite minor beach erosion  no substantial property damage occurred  although carolina beach  north carolina  lost about 1  ft (0.30  m  of the light impacts from hurricane grace  the resultant nor easter caused extensive coastal damage  high seas  and powerful winds  hurricane-force  wind gusts were reported in new england  the storm churned the ocean for several days  a wave 101  ft (31  m  in height was reported by an offshore buoy  extensive coastal flooding occurred along the coast of the mid-atlantic  and northeastern u s   with effects as far north as newfoundland and as far south as jamaica  the nor easter eventually transitioned into another hurricane that made landfall in nova a ship known as the andrea gail was lost  along with her six crew members  during the storm  the story of the andrea gail inspired sebastian junger s 1997  book  the perfect storm  and a 2000  motion picture
