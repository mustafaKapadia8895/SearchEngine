 mackerel is a common name applied to a number of different species of pelagic fish  mostly  but not exclusively  from the family scombridae  they are found in both temperate and tropical seas  mostly living along the coast or offshore in the oceanic environment mackerel typically have vertical stripes on their backs and deeply forked tails  many species are restricted in their distribution ranges  and live in separate populations or fish stocks based on geography  some stocks migrate in large schools along the coast to suitable spawning grounds  where they spawn in fairly shallow waters  after spawning they return the way they came  in smaller schools  to suitable feeding grounds often near an area of upwelling  from there they may move offshore into deeper waters and spend the winter in relative inactivity  other stocks migrate across oceans smaller mackerel are forage fish for larger predators  including larger mackerel and atlantic flocks of seabirds  as well as whales  dolphins  sharks and schools of larger fish such as tuna and marlin follow mackerel schools and attack them in sophisticated and cooperative ways  mackerel is high in omega-3  oils and is intensively harvested by humans  in 2009,  over five million tons were landed by commercial  see graph on the right   sport fishermen value the fighting abilities of the king 30  different species  principally belonging to the family scombridae  are commonly referred to as mackerel  the term  mackerel  means  marked  or  spotted   and derives from the old french maquerel  around 1300,  meaning a pimp or procurer  the connection is not altogether clear  but mackerel spawn enthusiastically in shoals near the coast  and medieval ideas on animal procreation were 21  species in the family scombridae are commonly called mackerel  the type species for the scombroid mackerel is the atlantic mackerel  scomber scombrus  until recently  atlantic chub mackerel and indo-pacific  chub mackerel were thought to be subspecies of the same species  in 1999,  collette established  on molecular and morphological considerations  that these are separate mackerel are smaller with shorter lifecycles than their close relatives  the tuna  which are also members of the same true mackerels belong to the tribe the tribe consists of seven species  each belonging to one of two genera  scomber and spanish mackerels belong to the tribe scomberomorini  which is the  sister tribe  of the true this tribe consists of 21  species in allâ€”18  of those are classified into the genus two into and a single species into the monotypic genus addition  a number of species with mackerel-like  characteristics in the families carangidae  hexagrammidae and gempylidae are commonly referred to as mackerel  there has been some confusion between the pacific jack mackerel  trachurus symmetricus  and the heavily harvested chilean jack mackerel  trachurus murphyi   these have been thought at times to be the same species  but are now recognised as separate term mackerel is also used as a modifier in the common names of other fish  sometimes indicating the fish has vertical stripes similar to a scombroid mackerel by extension  the term is applied also to other species such as the mackerel tabby and to inanimate objects such as the altocumulus mackerel sky cloud mackerel belong to the family scombridae  which also includes tuna and bonito  generally mackerel are much smaller and slimmer than tuna  though in other respects they share many common characteristics  their scales  if present at all  are extremely small  like tuna and bonito  mackerel are voracious feeders  and are swift and manoeuvrable swimmers  able to streamline themselves by retracting their fins into grooves on their body  like other scombroids  their bodies are cylindrical with numerous finlets on the dorsal and ventral sides behind the dorsal and anal fins  but unlike the deep-bodied  tuna  they are type species for scombroid mackerels is the atlantic mackerel  scomber scombrus  these fish are iridescent blue-green  above with a silvery underbelly and twenty to thirty near vertical wavy black stripes running across their upper might seem that the prominent stripes on the back of mackerels are there to provide camouflage against broken backgrounds  that is not the case  because mackerel live in midwater pelagic environments which have no however  fish have an optokinetic reflex in their visual systems which can be sensitive to moving in order for fish to school efficiently  they need feedback mechanisms that help them align themselves with adjacent fish  and match their speed  the stripes on neighbouring fish provide  schooling marks  which signal changes in relative is a layer of thin reflecting platelets on some of the mackerel stripes  in 1998,  e j denton and d m rowe argued that these platelets transmit additional information to other fish about how a given fish moves  as the orientation of the fish changes relative to another fish  the amount of light reflected to the second fish by this layer also changes  this sensitivity to orientation gives the mackerel  considerable advantages in being able to react quickly while schooling and range in size from small forage fish to larger game fish  coastal mackerel tend to be the king mackerel is an example of a larger mackerel  most fish are cold-blooded,  but there are exceptions  certain species of fish maintain elevated body temperatures  endothermic bony fishes are all in the suborder scombroidei and include the butterfly mackerel  a species of primitive are strong swimmers  atlantic mackerel can swim at a sustained speed of 0.98  metres sec with a burst speed of 5.5  while chub mackerel can swim at a sustained speed of 0.92  m s with a burst speed of 2.25  mackerel species have restricted distribution species of jack mackerels are found in coastal waters around new zealand  the australasian  chilean and pacific jack mackerels  they are mainly captured using purse seine nets  and are managed as a single stock that includes multiple mackerel species migrate vertically  adult snake mackerels conduct a diel vertical migration  staying in deeper water during the day and rising to the surface at night to feed  the young and juveniles also migrate vertically but in the opposite direction  staying near the surface during the day and moving deeper at this species feeds on squid  pelagic crustaceans  lanternfishes  flying fishes  sauries and other it is in turn preyed upon by tuna and are prolific broadcast spawners and must breed near the surface of the water due to the eggs of the females floating  individual females lay between 300,000  and 1,500,000  their eggs and larvae are pelagic  that is  they float free in the open sea  the larvae and juvenile mackerel feed on zooplankton  as adults they have sharp teeth  and hunt small crustaceans such as copepods  as well as forage fish  shrimp and squid  in turn they are hunted by larger pelagic animals such as tuna  billfish  sea lions  sharks and madagascar  spinner sharks follow migrating schools of bryde s whales feed on mackerel when they can find them  they use several feeding methods  including skimming the surface  lunging  and bubble mackerel  scomber japonicus  are the most intensively fished scombroid mackerel  as can be seen from the graph on the right  they account for about half the total capture production of scombroid as a species they are easily confused with atlantic mackerel  chub mackerel migrate long distances in oceans and across the mediterranean  they can be caught with drift nets and suitable trawls  but are most usually caught with surround nets at night by attracting them with lampara remaining catch of scombroid mackerels is divided equally between the atlantic mackerel and all other scombroid mackerels  just two species account for about 75%  of the total catch of scombroid jack mackerel are the most commonly fished non-scombroid  mackerel  fished as heavily as chub  see second graph on the right   the species has been overfished  and its fishery may now be in danger of mackerel behave like herrings  and are captured in similar fish species like these  which school near the surface  can be caught efficiently by purse seining  huge purse seiner vessels use spotter planes to locate the schooling fish  then they close in using sophisticated sonar to track the shape of the shoal  entire schools are then encircled with fast auxiliary boats which deploy purse seine nets as they speed around the designed trollers can also catch mackerels effectively when they swim near the surface  trollers typically have several long booms which they lift and drop with  topping lifts   they haul their lines with electric or hydraulic fish aggregating devices are also used to target north sea has been overfished to the point where the ecological balance has become disrupted and many jobs in the fishing industry have been southeast us region spans the gulf of mexico  the caribbean sea and the us southeast atlantic  overfishing of king and spanish mackerel occurred in the 1980s.  regulations were introduced to restrict the size  amount of catch  fishing locations and bag limits for recreational fishers as well as commercial fishers  gillnets were banned in waters off florida  by 2001,  the mackerel stocks had bounced is an important food fish that is consumed as an oily fish  it is a rich source of omega-3  fatty the flesh of mackerel spoils quickly  especially in the tropics  and can cause scombroid food poisoning  accordingly  it should be eaten on the day of capture  unless properly refrigerated or preservation is not simple  before the 19th-century  development of canning and the widespread availability of refrigeration  salting and smoking were the principal preservation methods historically in england  this fish was not preserved  but was consumed only in its fresh form  however  spoilage was common  leading the authors of the cambridge economic history of europe to remark   there are more references to stinking mackerel in english literature than to any other in france mackerel was traditionally pickled with large amounts of salt  which allowed it to be sold widely across the
