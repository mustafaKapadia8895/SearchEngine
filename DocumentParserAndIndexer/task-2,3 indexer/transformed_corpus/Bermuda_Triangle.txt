 the bermuda triangle  also known as the devil s triangle  is a loosely-defined  region in the western part of the north atlantic ocean  where a number of aircraft and ships are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances  most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery  the vicinity of the bermuda triangle is one of the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world  with ships frequently crossing through it for ports in the americas  europe  and the caribbean islands  cruise ships and pleasure craft regularly sail through the region  and commercial and private aircraft routinely fly over it popular culture has attributed various disappearances to the paranormal or activity by extraterrestrial beings  documented evidence indicates that a significant percentage of the incidents were spurious  inaccurately reported  or embellished by later authors in 1964,  vincent gaddis wrote in the pulp magazine argosy of the boundaries of the bermuda giving its vertices as miami  san juan  puerto rico  and bermuda  subsequent writers did not necessarily follow this some writers gave different boundaries and vertices to the triangle  with the total area varying from 1,300,000  to 3,900,000  km2  (500,000  to 1,510,000  sq consequently  the determination of which accidents occurred inside the triangle depends on which writer reported earliest suggestion of unusual disappearances in the bermuda area appeared in a september 17,  1950,  article published in the miami herald  associated by edward van winkle two years later  fate magazine published  sea mystery at our back a short article by george x  sand covering the loss of several planes and ships  including the loss of flight 19,  a group of five us navy grumman tbm avenger torpedo bombers on a training mission  sand s article was the first to lay out the now-familiar  triangular area where the losses took place  flight 19  alone would be covered again in the april 1962  issue of american legion in it  author allan w  eckert wrote that the flight leader had been heard saying   we are entering white water  nothing seems right  we don t know where we are  the water is green  no white   he also wrote that officials at the navy board of inquiry stated that the planes  flew off to sand s article was the first to suggest a supernatural element to the flight 19  incident  in the february 1964  issue of argosy  vincent gaddis  article  the deadly bermuda triangle  argued that flight 19  and other disappearances were part of a pattern of strange events in the the next year  gaddis expanded this article into a book  invisible would follow with their own works  elaborating on gaddis  ideas  john wallace spencer  limbo of the lost  1969,  repr  charles berlitz  the bermuda triangle  richard winer  the devil s triangle  and many others  all keeping to some of the same supernatural elements outlined by david kusche  author of the bermuda triangle mystery  solved argued that many claims of gaddis and subsequent writers were often exaggerated  dubious or unverifiable  kusche s research revealed a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies between berlitz s accounts and statements from eyewitnesses  participants  and others involved in the initial incidents  kusche noted cases where pertinent information went unreported  such as the disappearance of round-the-world  yachtsman donald crowhurst  which berlitz had presented as a mystery  despite clear evidence to the contrary  another example was the ore-carrier  recounted by berlitz as lost without trace three days out of an atlantic port when it had been lost three days out of a port with the same name in the pacific ocean  kusche also argued that a large percentage of the incidents that sparked allegations of the triangle s mysterious influence actually occurred well outside it  often his research was simple  he would review period newspapers of the dates of reported incidents and find reports on possibly relevant events like unusual weather  that were never mentioned in the disappearance stories kusche concluded that in a 2013  study  the world wide fund for nature identified the world s 10  most dangerous waters for shipping  but the bermuda triangle was not among the uk channel 4  television program the bermuda triangle was being produced by john simmons of geofilms for the equinox series  the marine insurance market lloyd s of london was asked if an unusually large number of ships had sunk in the bermuda triangle area  lloyd s determined that large numbers of ships had not sunk lloyd s does not charge higher rates for passing through this area  united states coast guard records confirm their conclusion  in fact  the number of supposed disappearances is relatively insignificant considering the number of ships and aircraft that pass through on a regular coast guard is also officially skeptical of the triangle  noting that they collect and publish  through their inquiries  much documentation contradicting many of the incidents written about by the triangle authors  in one such incident involving the 1972  explosion and sinking of the tanker v  a  fogg  the coast guard photographed the wreck and recovered several in contrast with one triangle author s claim that all the bodies had vanished  with the exception of the captain  who was found sitting in his cabin at his desk  clutching a coffee in addition  v  a  fogg sank off the coast of texas  nowhere near the commonly accepted boundaries of the triangle the nova horizon episode the case of the bermuda triangle  aired on june 27,  1976,  was highly critical  stating that  when we ve gone back to the original sources or the people involved  the mystery evaporates  science does not have to answer questions about the triangle because those questions are not valid in the first place     ships and planes behave in the triangle the same way they behave everywhere else in the researchers  such as ernest and barry have noted how mysteries and the paranormal are very popular and profitable  this has led to the production of vast amounts of material on topics such as the bermuda triangle  they were able to show that some of the pro-paranormal  material is often misleading or inaccurate  but its producers continue to market it  accordingly  they have claimed that the market is biased in favor of books  tv specials  and other media that support the triangle mystery  and against well-researched  material if it espouses a skeptical viewpoint persons accepting the bermuda triangle as a real phenomenon have offered a number of explanatory approaches triangle writers have used a number of supernatural concepts to explain the events  one explanation pins the blame on leftover technology from the mythical lost continent of atlantis  sometimes connected to the atlantis story is the submerged rock formation known as the bimini road off the island of bimini in the bahamas  which is in the triangle by some definitions  followers of the purported psychic edgar cayce take his prediction that evidence of atlantis would be found in 1968,  as referring to the discovery of the bimini road  believers describe the formation as a road  wall  or other structure  but the bimini road is of natural writers attribute the events to this idea was used by steven spielberg for his science fiction film close encounters of the third kind  which features the lost flight 19  aircrews as alien abductees charles berlitz  author of various books on anomalous phenomena  lists several theories attributing the losses in the triangle to anomalous or unexplained paranormal explanation in the 2005  three-part  us-british-german  science fiction miniseries the triangle  says the triangle is a wormhole compass problems are one of the cited phrases in many triangle incidents  while some have theorized that unusual local magnetic anomalies may exist in the such anomalies have not been found  compasses have natural magnetic variations in relation to the magnetic poles  a fact which navigators have known for centuries  magnetic  compass  north and geographic  true  north are only exactly the same for a small number of places – for example  as of 2000,  in the united states  only those places on a line running from wisconsin to the gulf of but the public may not be as informed  and think there is something mysterious about a compass  changing  across an area as large as the triangle  which it naturally gulf stream is a major surface current  primarily driven by thermohaline circulation that originates in the gulf of mexico and then flows through the straits of florida into the north atlantic  in essence  it is a river within an ocean  and  like a river  it can and does carry floating objects  it has a maximum surface velocity of about 2  m s (6.6  a small plane making a water landing or a boat having engine trouble can be carried away from its reported position by the current one of the most cited explanations in official inquiries as to the loss of any aircraft or vessel is human human stubbornness may have caused businessman harvey conover to lose his sailing yacht  revonoc  as he sailed into the teeth of a storm south of florida on january 1,  are powerful storms that form in tropical waters and have historically cost thousands of lives and caused billions of dollars in damage  the sinking of francisco de bobadilla s spanish fleet in 1502  was the first recorded instance of a destructive hurricane  these storms have in the past caused a number of incidents related to the triangle a powerful downdraft of cold air was suspected to be a cause in the sinking of pride of baltimore on may 14,  1986.  the crew of the sunken vessel noted the wind suddenly shifted and increased velocity from 32  km h (20  mph  to 97–145  km h (60–90  mph   a national hurricane center satellite specialist  james lushine  stated  during very unstable weather conditions the downburst of cold air from aloft can hit the surface like a bomb  exploding outward like a giant squall line of wind and a similar event occurred to concordia in 2010,  off the coast of brazil  scientists are currently investigating whether  hexagonal  clouds may be the source of these up-to-170  mph (270  km h   air explanation for some of the disappearances has focused on the presence of large fields of methane hydrates  a form of natural gas  on the continental laboratory experiments carried out in australia have proven that bubbles can  indeed  sink a scale model ship by decreasing the density of the any wreckage consequently rising to the surface would be rapidly dispersed by the gulf stream  it has been hypothesized that periodic methane eruptions  sometimes called  mud volcanoes   may produce regions of frothy water that are no longer capable of providing adequate buoyancy for ships  if this were the case  such an area forming around a ship could cause it to sink very rapidly and without warning publications by the usgs describe large stores of undersea hydrates worldwide  including the blake ridge area  off the coast of the southeastern united however  according to the usgs  no large releases of gas hydrates are believed to have occurred in the bermuda triangle for the past 15,000  austin supposedly came across a derelict ship  placed on board a prize crew  and attempted to sail with it to new york in 1881.  according to the stories  the derelict disappeared  others elaborating further that the derelict reappeared minus the prize crew  then disappeared again with a second prize crew on board  a check from lloyd s of london records proved the existence of meta  built in 1854,  and that in 1880,  meta was renamed ellen austin  there are no casualty listings for this vessel  or any vessel at that time  that would suggest a large number of missing men were placed on board a derelict that later incident resulting in the single largest loss of life in the history of the us navy not related to combat occurred when the collier cyclops  carrying a full load of manganese ore and with one engine out of action  went missing without a trace with a crew of 309  sometime after march 4,  1918,  after departing the island of barbados  although there is no strong evidence for any single theory  many independent theories exist  some blaming storms  some capsizing  and some suggesting that wartime enemy activity was to blame for the in addition  two of cyclops s sister ships  proteus and nereus were subsequently lost in the north atlantic during world war ii  both ships were transporting heavy loads of metallic ore similar to that which was loaded on cyclops during her fatal voyage  in all three cases structural failure due to overloading with a much denser cargo than designed is considered the most likely cause of sinking a five-masted  schooner built in 1919,  carroll a  deering was found hard aground and abandoned at diamond shoals  near cape hatteras  north carolina  on january 31,  1921.  rumors and more at the time indicated deering was a victim of piracy  possibly connected with the illegal rum-running  trade during prohibition  and possibly involving another ship  hewitt  which disappeared at roughly the same time  just hours later  an unknown steamer sailed near the lightship along the track of deering  and ignored all signals from the lightship  it is speculated that hewitt may have been this mystery ship  and possibly involved in deering s crew 19  was a training flight of five tbm avenger torpedo bombers that disappeared on december 5,  1945,  while over the atlantic  the squadron s flight plan was scheduled to take them due east from fort lauderdale for 141  mi (227  km   north for 73  mi (117  km   and then back over a final 140-mile  (230-kilometre)  leg to complete the exercise  the flight never returned to base  the disappearance is attributed by navy investigators to navigational error leading to the aircraft running out of fuel one of the search and rescue aircraft deployed to look for them  a pbm mariner with a 13-man  crew  also disappeared  a tanker off the coast of florida reported seeing an and observing a widespread oil slick when fruitlessly searching for survivors  the weather was becoming stormy by the end of the according to contemporaneous sources the mariner had a history of explosions due to vapour leaks when heavily loaded with fuel  as it might have been for a potentially long search-and-rescue  operation.g-ahnp  star tiger disappeared on january 30,  1948,  on a flight from the azores to bermuda  g-agre  star ariel disappeared on january 17,  1949,  on a flight from bermuda to kingston

the 32  people on board  was ever found  a civil aeronautics board investigation found there was insufficient information available on which to determine probable cause of the pleasure yacht was found adrift in the atlantic south of bermuda on september 26,  1955;  it is usually stated in the stories  berlitz  that the crew vanished while the yacht survived being at sea during three hurricanes  the 1955  atlantic hurricane season shows hurricane ione passing nearby between 14  and 18  september  with bermuda being affected by winds of almost gale in his second book on the bermuda triangle  winer quoted from a letter he had received from mr j e  challenor of the morning of september 22,  connemara iv was lying to a heavy mooring in the open roadstead of carlisle bay  because of the approaching hurricane  the owner strengthened the mooring ropes and put out two additional anchors  there was little else he could do  as the exposed mooring was the only available anchorage      in carlisle bay  the sea in the wake of hurricane janet was awe-inspiring  and dangerous  the owner of connemara iv observed that she had disappeared  an investigation revealed that she had dragged her moorings and gone to sea on august 28,  1963,  a pair of us air force kc-135  stratotanker aircraft collided and crashed into the atlantic  the triangle version  winer  berlitz  of this story states that while the two aircraft did collide and crash  there were two distinct crash sites  separated by over 160  miles (260  km  of water  however  kusche s research showed that the unclassified version of the air force investigation report stated that the debris field defining the second  crash site  was examined by a search and rescue ship  and found to be a mass of seaweed and driftwood tangled in an old the
