 water vapor  water vapour or aqueous vapor is the gaseous phase of water  it is one state of water within the hydrosphere  water vapor can be produced from the evaporation or boiling of liquid water or from the sublimation of ice  unlike other forms of water  water vapor is under typical atmospheric conditions  water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by condensation  it is lighter than air and triggers convection currents that can lead to clouds being a component of earth s hydrosphere and hydrologic cycle  it is particularly abundant in earth s atmosphere where it is also a potent greenhouse gas along with other gases such as carbon dioxide and methane  use of water vapor  as steam  has been important to humans for cooking and as a major component in energy production and transport systems since the industrial revolution water vapor is a relatively common atmospheric constituent  present even in the solar atmosphere as well as every planet in the solar system and many astronomical objects including natural satellites  comets and even large asteroids  likewise the detection of extrasolar water vapor would indicate a similar distribution in other planetary systems  water vapor is significant in that it can be indirect evidence supporting the presence of extraterrestrial liquid water in the case of some planetary mass objects whenever a water molecule leaves a surface and diffuses into a surrounding gas  it is said to have evaporated  each individual water molecule which transitions between a more associated  liquid  and a less associated  vapor gas  state does so through the absorption or release of kinetic energy  the aggregate measurement of this kinetic energy transfer is defined as thermal energy and occurs only when there is differential in the temperature of the water molecules  liquid water that becomes water vapor takes a parcel of heat with it  in a process called evaporative the amount of water vapor in the air determines how fast each molecule will return to the surface  when a net evaporation occurs  the body of water will undergo a net cooling directly related to the loss of water in the us  the national weather service measures the actual rate of evaporation from a standardized  pan  open water surface outdoors  at various locations nationwide  others do likewise around the world  the us data is collected and compiled into an annual evaporation the measurements range from under 30  to over 120  inches per year  formulas can be used for calculating the rate of evaporation from a water surface such as a swimming in some countries  the evaporation rate far exceeds the precipitation rate evaporative cooling is restricted by atmospheric conditions  humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air  the vapor content of air is measured with devices known as hygrometers  the measurements are usually expressed as specific humidity or percent relative humidity  the temperatures of the atmosphere and the water surface determine the equilibrium vapor pressure  100%  relative humidity occurs when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure  this condition is often referred to as complete saturation  humidity ranges from 0  gram per cubic metre in dry air to 30  grams per cubic metre (0.03  ounce per cubic foot  when the vapor is saturated at 30   see also absolute humidity is when water molecules directly leave the surface of ice without first becoming liquid water  sublimation accounts for the slow mid-winter  disappearance of ice and snow at temperatures too low to cause melting  antarctica shows this effect to a unique degree because it is by far the continent with the lowest rate of precipitation on earth  as a result  there are large areas where millennial layers of snow have sublimed  leaving behind whatever non-volatile  materials they had contained  this is extremely valuable to certain scientific disciplines  a dramatic example being the collection of meteorites that are left exposed in unparalleled numbers and excellent states of preservation sublimation is important in the preparation of certain classes of biological specimens for scanning electron microscopy  typically the specimens are prepared by cryofixation and freeze-fracture,  after which the broken surface is freeze-etched,  being eroded by exposure to vacuum till it shows the required level of detail  this technique can display protein molecules  organelle structures and lipid bilayers with very low degrees of distortion water vapor will only condense onto another surface when that surface is cooler than the dew point temperature  or when the water vapor equilibrium in air has been exceeded  when water vapor condenses onto a surface  a net warming occurs on that surface  the water molecule brings heat energy with it  in turn  the temperature of the atmosphere drops in the atmosphere  condensation produces clouds  fog and precipitation  usually only when facilitated by cloud condensation nuclei   the dew point of an air parcel is the temperature to which it must cool before water vapor in the air begins to condense concluding water vapor is a type of water or rain also  a net condensation of water vapor occurs on surfaces when the temperature of the surface is at or below the dew point temperature of the atmosphere  deposition is a phase transition separate from condensation which leads to the direct formation of ice from water vapor  frost and snow are examples of deposition a number of chemical reactions have water as a product  if the reactions take place at temperatures higher than the dew point of the surrounding air the water will be formed as vapor and increase the local humidity  if below the dew point local condensation will occur  typical reactions that result in water formation are the burning of hydrogen or hydrocarbons in air or other oxygen containing gas mixtures  or as a result of reactions with oxidizers in a similar fashion other chemical or physical reactions can take place in the presence of water vapor resulting in new chemicals forming such as rust on iron or steel  polymerization occurring  certain polyurethane foams and cyanoacrylate glues cure with exposure to atmospheric humidity  or forms changing such as where anhydrous chemicals may absorb enough vapor to form a crystalline structure or alter an existing one  sometimes resulting in characteristic color changes that can be used for measurement measuring the quantity of water vapor in a medium can be done directly or remotely with varying degrees of accuracy  remote methods such electromagnetic absorption are possible from satellites above planetary atmospheres  direct methods may use electronic transducers  moistened thermometers or hygroscopic materials measuring changes in physical properties or dimensions water vapor is lighter or less dense than dry at equivalent temperatures it is buoyant with respect to dry air  whereby the density of dry air at standard temperature and pressure is 1.27  g l and water vapor at standard temperature and pressure has the much lower density of 0.804  g l water vapor and dry air density calculations at 0  °c at the same temperature  a column of dry air will be denser or heavier than a column of air containing any water vapor  the molar mass of diatomic nitrogen and diatomic oxygen both being greater than the molar mass of water  thus  any volume of dry air will sink if placed in a larger volume of moist air  also  a volume of moist air will rise or be buoyant if placed in a larger region of dry air  as the temperature rises the proportion of water vapor in the air increases  and its buoyancy will increase  the increase in buoyancy can have a significant atmospheric impact  giving rise to powerful  moisture rich  upward air currents when the air temperature and sea temperature reaches 25  °c or above  this phenomenon provides a significant driving force for cyclonic and anticyclonic weather systems  typhoons and hurricanes  water vapor is a by-product  of respiration in plants and animals  its contribution to the pressure  increases as its concentration increases  its partial pressure contribution to air pressure increases  lowering the partial pressure contribution of the other atmospheric gases  dalton s law   the total air pressure must remain constant  the presence of water vapor in the air naturally dilutes or displaces the other air components as its concentration increases this can have an effect on respiration  in very warm air (35  °c  the proportion of water vapor is large enough to give rise to the stuffiness that can be experienced in humid jungle conditions or in poorly ventilated buildings water vapor has lower density than that of air and is therefore buoyant in air but has lower vapor pressure than that of air  when water vapor is used as a lifting gas for use by a thermal airship the water vapor is heated to form steam so that its vapor pressure is greater than the surrounding air pressure in order to pressurize and to maintain the shape a theoretical  steam balloon   which yields approximately 60%  the lift of helium and twice that of hot amount of water vapor in an atmosphere is constrained by the restrictions of partial pressures and temperature  dew point temperature and relative humidity act as guidelines for the process of water vapor in the water cycle  energy input  such as sunlight  can trigger more evaporation on an ocean surface or more sublimation on a chunk of ice on top of a mountain  the balance between condensation and evaporation gives the quantity called vapor partial pressure the maximum partial pressure  saturation pressure  of water vapor in air varies with temperature of the air and water vapor mixture  a variety of empirical formulas exist for this quantity  the most used reference formula is the goff-gratch  equation for the svp over liquid water below zero degree celsius the formula is valid from about −50  to 102  °c  however there are a very limited number of measurements of the vapor pressure of water over supercooled liquid water  there are a number of other formulae which can be certain conditions  such as when the boiling temperature of water is reached  a net evaporation will always occur during standard atmospheric conditions regardless of the percent of relative humidity  this immediate process will dispel massive amounts of water vapor into a cooler atmosphere exhaled air is almost fully at equilibrium with water vapor at the body temperature  in the cold air the exhaled vapor quickly condenses  thus showing up as a fog or mist of water droplets and as condensation or frost on surfaces  forcibly condensing these water droplets from exhaled breath is the basis of exhaled breath condensate  an evolving medical diagnostic test controlling water vapor in air is a key concern in the heating  ventilating  and air-conditioning   hvac  industry  thermal comfort depends on the moist air conditions  non-human  comfort situations are called refrigeration  and also are affected by water vapor  for example  many food stores  like supermarkets  utilize open chiller cabinets  or food cases  which can significantly lower the water vapor pressure  lowering humidity   this practice delivers several benefits as well as problems gaseous water represents a small but environmentally significant constituent of the atmosphere  the percentage water vapor in surface air varies from 0.01%  at -42  °c (-44  to 4.24%  when the dew point is 30  °c (86  approximately 99.13%  of it is contained in the troposphere  the condensation of water vapor to the liquid or ice phase is responsible for clouds  rain  snow  and other precipitation  all of which count among the most significant elements of what we experience as weather  less obviously  the latent heat of vaporization  which is released to the atmosphere whenever condensation occurs  is one of the most important terms in the atmospheric energy budget on both local and global scales  for example  latent heat release in atmospheric convection is directly responsible for powering destructive storms such as tropical cyclones and severe thunderstorms  water vapor is the most potent greenhouse gas owing to the presence of the hydroxyl bond which strongly absorbs in the infra-red  region of the light spectrum water in earth s atmosphere is not merely below its boiling point (100  °c   but at altitude it goes below its freezing point (0  °c   due to water s highly polar attraction  when combined with its quantity  water vapor then has a relevant dew point and frost point  unlike e  g   carbon dioxide and methane  water vapor thus has a scale height a fraction of that of the bulk as the water condenses and exits  primarily in the troposphere  the lowest layer of the carbon dioxide (co2)  and methane  being non-polar,  rise above water vapor  the absorption and emission of both compounds contribute to earth s emission to space  and thus the planetary greenhouse this greenhouse forcing is directly observable  via distinct spectral features versus water vapor  and observed to be rising with rising co2  conversely  adding water vapor at high altitudes has a disproportionate impact  which is why methane  rising  then oxidizing to co2  and two water molecules  and jet have disproportionately high warming effects it is less clear how cloudiness would respond to a warming climate  depending on the nature of the response  clouds could either further amplify or partly mitigate warming from long-lived  greenhouse gases in the absence of other greenhouse gases  earth s water vapor would condense to the this has likely happened  possibly more than once  scientists thus distinguish between non-condensable   driving  and condensable  driven  greenhouse gases-  i  e   the above water vapor and clouds form through condensation around cloud condensation nuclei  in the absence of nuclei  condensation will only occur at much lower temperatures  under persistent condensation or deposition  cloud droplets or snowflakes form  which precipitate when they reach a critical mass the water content of the atmosphere as a whole is constantly depleted by precipitation  at the same time it is constantly replenished by evaporation  most prominently from seas  lakes  rivers  and moist earth  other sources of atmospheric water include combustion  respiration  volcanic eruptions  the transpiration of plants  and various other biological and geological processes  the mean global content of water vapor in the atmosphere is roughly sufficient to cover the surface of the planet with a layer of liquid water about 25  mm deep  the mean annual precipitation for the planet is about 1  meter  which implies a rapid turnover of water in the air – on average  the residence time of a water molecule in the troposphere is about 9  to 10  days episodes of surface geothermal activity  such as volcanic eruptions and geysers  release variable amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere  such eruptions may be large in human terms  and major explosive eruptions may inject exceptionally large masses of water exceptionally high into the atmosphere  but as a percentage of total atmospheric water  the role of such processes is minor  the relative concentrations of the various gases emitted by volcanoes varies considerably according to the site and according to the particular event at any one site  however  water vapor is consistently the commonest volcanic gas  as a rule  it comprises more than 60%  of total emissions during a subaerial water vapor content is expressed using various measures  these include vapor pressure  specific humidity  mixing ratio  dew point temperature  and relative humidity because water molecules absorb microwaves and other radio wave frequencies  water in the atmosphere attenuates radar in addition  atmospheric water will reflect and refract signals to an extent that depends on whether it is vapor  liquid or solid generally  radar signals lose strength progressively the farther they travel through the troposphere  different frequencies attenuate at different rates  such that some components of air are opaque to some frequencies and transparent to others  radio waves used for broadcasting and other communication experience the same effect water vapor reflects radar to a lesser extent than do water s other two phases  in the form of drops and ice crystals  water acts as a prism  which it does not do as an individual molecule  however  the existence of water vapor in the atmosphere causes the atmosphere to act as a giant comparison of goes-12  satellite images shows the distribution of atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans  clouds and continents of the earth  vapor surrounds the planet but is unevenly distributed  the image loop on the right shows monthly average of water vapor content with the units are given in centimeters  which is the precipitable water or equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense  the lowest amounts of water vapor (0  centimeters  appear in yellow  and the highest amounts (6  centimeters  appear in dark blue  areas of missing data appear in shades of gray  the maps are based on data collected by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer  modis  sensor on nasa s aqua satellite  the most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor  in the tropics  a band of extremely humid air wobbles north and south of the equator as the seasons change  this band of humidity is part of the intertropical convergence zone  where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily  thunderstorms and clouds  farther from the equator  water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter  another pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do  this is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean  water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder water vapour absorbs light in the visible spectral range  its absorption can be used in spectroscopic applications  such as doas  to determine the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere  this is done operationally  e g  from the gome spectrometers on ers and the weaker water vapor absorption lines in the blue spectral range and further into the uv up to its dissociation limit around 243  nm are mostly based on quantum mechanical and are only partly confirmed by vapor plays a key role in lightning production in the atmosphere  from cloud physics  usually  clouds are the real generators of static charge as found in earth s atmosphere  but the ability  or capability of clouds to hold massive amounts of electrical energy is directly related to the amount of water vapor present in the local system the amount of water vapor directly controls the permittivity of the air  during times of low humidity  static discharge is quick and easy  during times of higher humidity  fewer static discharges occur  permittivity and capacitance work hand in hand to produce the megawatt outputs of a cloud  for instance  has started its way to becoming a lightning generator  atmospheric water vapor acts as a substance  or insulator  that decreases the ability of the cloud to discharge its electrical energy  over a certain amount of time  if the cloud continues to generate and store more static electricity  the barrier that was created by the atmospheric water vapor will ultimately break down from the stored electrical potential this energy will be released to a locally  oppositely charged region in the form of lightning  the strength of each discharge is directly related to the atmospheric permittivity  capacitance  and the source s charge generating vapor is common in the solar system and by extension  other planetary systems  its signature has been detected in the atmospheres of the sun  occurring in sunspots  the presence of water vapor has been detected in the atmospheres of all seven extraterrestrial planets in the solar system  the earth s and the moons of other although typically in only trace amounts geological formations such as cryogeysers are thought to exist on the surface of several icy moons ejecting water vapor due to tidal heating and may indicate the presence of substantial quantities of subsurface water  plumes of water vapor have been detected on jupiter s moon europa and are similar to plumes of water vapor detected on saturn s moon traces of water vapor have also been detected in the stratosphere of water vapor has been found to be a major constituent of the atmosphere of dwarf planet  ceres  largest object in the asteroid the detection was made by using the far-infrared  abilities of the herschel space the finding is unexpected because comets  not asteroids  are typically considered to  sprout jets and plumes   according to one of the scientists   the lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and scientists studying mars hypothesize that if water moves about the planet  it does so as brilliance of comet tails comes largely from water vapor  on approach to the sun  the ice many comets carry sublimates to vapor  which reflects light from the sun  knowing a comet s distance from the sun  astronomers may deduce a comet s water content from its vapor has also been confirmed outside the solar system  spectroscopic analysis of hd 209458  b  an extrasolar planet in the constellation pegasus  provides the first evidence of atmospheric water vapor beyond the solar system  a star called cw leonis was found to have a ring of vast quantities of water vapor circling the aging  massive star  a nasa satellite designed to study chemicals in interstellar gas clouds  made the discovery with an onboard spectrometer  most likely   the water vapor was vaporized from the surfaces of orbiting hat-p-11b  a relatively small exoplanet has also been found to possess water
