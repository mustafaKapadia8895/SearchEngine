 the monsoon of south asia is among several geographically distributed global monsoons  it affects the indian subcontinent  where it is one of the oldest and most anticipated weather phenomena and an economically important pattern every year from june through september  but it is only partly understood and notoriously difficult to predict  several theories have been proposed to explain the origin  process  strength  variability  distribution  and general vagaries of the monsoon  but understanding and predictability are still evolving the unique geographical features of the indian subcontinent  along with associated atmospheric  oceanic  and geophysical factors  influence the behavior of the monsoon  because of its effect on agriculture  on flora and fauna  and on the climates of nations such as india  nepal  bangladesh  bhutan  pakistan  and sri lanka — among other economic  social  and environmental effects — the monsoon is one of the most anticipated  and studied weather phenomena in the region  it has a significant effect on the overall well-being  of residents and has even been dubbed the  real finance minister of word monsoon  derived from the arabic  mausam   meaning  season    although generally defined as a system of winds characterized by a seasonal reversal of lacks a consistent  detailed definition  some examples are observed initially by sailors in the arabian traveling between africa  india  and southeast asia  the monsoon can be categorized into two branches based on their spread over the subcontinent alternatively  it can be categorized into two segments based on the direction of rain-bearing  winds based on the time of year that these winds bring rain to india  the monsoon can also be categorized into two periods the complexity of the monsoon of south asia is not completely understood  making it difficult to accurately predict the quantity  timing  and geographic distribution of the accompanying precipitation  these are the most monitored components of the monsoon  and they determine the water availability in india for any given typically occur in tropical one area that monsoons impact greatly is in india monsoons create an entire season in which the winds reverse atmospheric conditions influence the monsoon winds  the first condition is the differential heating and cooling of land and water  this creates low pressure on the landmass  while high pressure is created over the seas around during daytime  but is reversed during the nighttime the second condition is the shift in the position of inter-tropical  convergence zone  itcz   in summer  the equatorial trough normally positioned about 5°n  of the equator moves over the ganga plain creating a monsoon trough during the monsoon season the third condition is the presence of the high-pressure  area that develops east of madagascar  it is approximately at 20°s  over the indian ocean  the intensity and position of this high-pressure  area affects the indian monsoon the fourth condition develops during the summer  the tibetan plateau gets intensely heated resulting in strong vertical air currents and high pressure over the plateau about 9  km above sea level  the fifth condition develops during the summer due to the movement of the westerly jet streams to the north of the himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the indian peninsula changes in pressure over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons  in certain years  there is a reversal in the pressure conditions  this periodic change in pressure conditions is known as the southern oscillation  or so the southern oscillation is connected to el nino  which is a warm ocean current that flows past the peruvian coast  it flows every two to five years in place of the cold peruvian current  the phenomenon is  referred to as enso  el nino southern oscillations   in india  the monsoon lasts for 100  to 120  days from early june and to mid-september.  the monsoon winds encounter various atmospheric conditions on their way and hence are pulsating in nature  and not steady the monsoon arrives with a sudden downpour of rainfall that continues for several days  this is known as the ‘burst’ of the monsoon the rainfall is a result of the convergence of wind flow from the bay of bengal and reverse winds from the south china onset of the monsoon occurs over the bay of bengal in arriving at the indian peninsula by and then the winds move towards the south china by early september  the monsoon starts to withdraw or retreat and is a more gradual process  by mid-october,  it withdraws completely from the northern half of the peninsula  the withdrawal takes place progressively from north to south from the first week of december to the first week of january  this is the start of the winter season the retreating monsoon winds move over the arabian sea and the bay of bengal  and collect moisture on the way  these monsoon winds reach the southern states of india by october  and are responsible for a second round of rainfall  these are called the winter monsoons  the winter monsoon is experienced in the states of karnataka  tamil nadu  kerala and andhra pradesh in the first week of january although the southwest and northeast monsoon winds are seasonally reversible  they do not cause precipitation on their own two factors are essential for rain formation additionally  one of the causes of rain must happen  in the case of the monsoon  the cause is primarily orographic  due to the presence of highlands in the path of the winds  orographic barriers force wind to rise  precipitation then occurs on the windward side of the highlands because of adiabatic cooling and condensation of the moist rising air the unique geographic relief features of the indian subcontinent come into play in allowing all of the above factors to occur simultaneously  the relevant features in explaining the monsoon mechanism are as follows pink arrow  southwest monsoon wind direction  green arrow  northeast monsoon wind direction orographic precipitation geographical features of the indian subcontinent daytime scene showing the pre-monsoon  air over india recent trends in average annual precipitation from monsoons there are some unique features of the rains that the monsoon brings to the indian subcontinent bursting of monsoon refers to the sudden change in weather conditions in india  typically from hot and dry weather to wet and humid weather during the southwest monsoon   characterized by an abrupt rise in the mean daily similarly  the burst of the northeast monsoon refers to an abrupt increase in the mean daily rainfall over the affected of the most commonly used words to describe the erratic nature of the monsoon is  vagaries   used in web to insurance and india s budget in some years  it rains too much  causing floods in parts of india  in others  it rains too little or not at all  causing droughts  in some years  the rain quantity is sufficient but its timing arbitrary  sometimes  despite average annual rainfall  the daily distribution or geographic distribution of the rain is substantially skewed  in the recent past  rainfall variability in short time periods  about a week  were attributed to desert dust over the arabian sea and western the southwest monsoon can be expected to  burst  onto the western coast of india  near thiruvananthapuram  at the beginning of june and to cover the entire country by its withdrawal from india typically starts at the beginning of september and finishes by the beginning of northeast monsoon usually  bursts  around the 20th  of october and lasts for about 50  days before a rainy monsoon is not necessarily a normal monsoon — that is  one that performs close to statistical averages calculated over a long period  a normal monsoon is generally accepted to be one involving close to the average quantity of precipitation over all the geographical locations under its influence  mean spatial distribution  and over the entire expected time period  mean temporal distribution   additionally  the arrival date and the departure date of both the southwest and northeast monsoon should be close to the mean dates  the exact criteria for a normal monsoon are defined by the indian meteorological department with calculations for the mean and standard deviation of each of these a monsoon with excess rain can cause floods  and one with too little rain can lead to widespread drought  famine  and economic losses  therefore  a normal monsoon with mean performance is the most desirable monsoon theories of the mechanism of the monsoon primarily try to explain the reasons for the seasonal reversal of winds and the timing of their reversal because of differences in the specific heat capacity of land and water  continents heat up faster than seas  consequently  the air above coastal lands heats up faster than the air above seas  this creates areas of low air pressure above coastal lands compared with pressure over the seas  causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands  this is known as sea breeze also known as the thermal theory or the differential heating of sea and land theory  the traditional theory portrays the monsoon as a large-scale  sea breeze  it states that during the hot subtropical summers  the massive landmass of the indian peninsula heats up at a different rate than the surrounding seas  resulting in a pressure gradient from south to north  this causes the flow of moisture-laden  winds from sea to land  on reaching land  these winds rise because of the geographical relief  cooling adiabatically and leading to orographic rains  this is the southwest monsoon  the reverse happens during the winter  when the land is colder than the sea  establishing a pressure gradient from land to sea  this causes the winds to blow over the indian subcontinent toward the indian ocean in a northeasterly direction  causing the northeast monsoon  because the southwest monsoon flows from sea to land  it carries more moisture  and therefore causes more rain  than the northeast monsoon  only part of the northeast monsoon passing over the bay of bengal picks up moisture  causing rain in andhra pradesh and tamil nadu during the winter months however  many meteorologists argue that the monsoon is not a local phenomenon as explained by the traditional theory  but a general weather phenomenon along the entire tropical zone of earth  this criticism does not deny the role of differential heating of sea and land in generating monsoon winds  but casts it as one of several factors rather than the only one the prevailing winds of the atmospheric circulation arise because of the difference in pressure at various latitudes and act as means for distribution of thermal energy on the planet  this pressure difference is because of the differences in solar insolation received at different latitudes and the resulting uneven heating of the planet  alternating belts of high pressure and low pressure develop along the equator  the two tropics  the arctic and antarctic circles  and the two polar regions  giving rise to the trade winds  the westerlies  and the polar easterlies  however  geophysical factors like earth s orbit  its rotation  and its axial tilt cause these belts to shift gradually north and south  following the sun s seasonal shifts the dynamic theory explains the monsoon on the basis of the annual shifts in the position of global belts of pressure and winds  according to this theory  the monsoon is a result of the shift of the inter tropical convergence zone  itcz  under the influence of the vertical sun  though the mean position of the itcz is taken as the equator  it shifts north and south with the migration of the vertical sun toward the tropics of cancer and capricorn during the summer of the respective hemispheres  northern and southern hemisphere   as such  during the northern summer  may and june   the itcz moves north  along with the vertical sun  toward the tropic of cancer  the itcz  as the zone of lowest pressure in the tropical region  is the target destination for the trade winds of both hemispheres  consequently  with the itcz at the tropic of cancer  the southeast trade winds of the southern hemisphere have to cross the equator to reach 5]  however  because of the coriolis effect  which causes winds in the northern hemisphere to turn right  whereas winds in the southern hemisphere turn left   these southeast trade winds are deflected east in the northern hemisphere  transforming into southwest 6]  these pick up moisture while traveling from sea to land and cause orographic rain once they hit the highlands of the indian peninsula  this results in the southwest monsoon the dynamic theory explains the monsoon as a global weather phenomenon rather than just a local one  and when coupled with the traditional theory  based on the heating of sea and land   it enhances the explanation of the varying intensity of monsoon precipitation along the coastal regions with orographic barriers this theory tries to explain the establishment of the northeast and southwest monsoons  as well as unique features like  bursting  and variability the jet streams are systems of upper-air  westerlies  they give rise to slowly moving upper-air  waves  with 250-knot  winds in some air streams  first observed by world war ii pilots  they develop just below the tropopause over areas of steep pressure gradient on the surface  the main types are the polar jets  the subtropical westerly jets  and the less common tropical easterly jets  they follow the principle of geostrophic 7]over  india  a subtropical westerly jet develops in the winter season and is replaced by the tropical easterly jet in the summer season  the high temperature during the summer over the tibetan plateau  as well as over central asia in general  is believed to be the critical factor leading to the formation of the tropical easterly jet over india the mechanism affecting the monsoon is that the westerly jet causes high pressure over northern parts of the subcontinent during the winter  this results in the north-to-south  flow of the winds in the form of the northeast monsoon  with the northward shift of the vertical sun  this jet shifts north  too  the intense heat over the tibetan plateau  coupled with associated terrain features like the high altitude of the plateau  generate the tropical easterly jet over central india  this jet creates a low-pressure  zone over the northern indian plains  influencing the wind flow toward these plains and assisting the development of the southwest monsoon the of the monsoon is primarily explained by the jet stream theory and the dynamic theory according to this theory  during the summer months in the northern hemisphere  the itcz shifts north  pulling the southwest monsoon winds onto the land from the sea  however  the huge landmass of the himalayas restricts the low-pressure  zone onto the himalayas themselves  it is only when the tibetan plateau heats up significantly more than the himalayas that the itcz abruptly and swiftly shifts north  leading to the bursting of monsoon rains over the indian subcontinent  the reverse shift takes place for the northeast monsoon winds  leading to a second  minor burst of rainfall over the eastern indian peninsula during the northern hemisphere winter months according to this theory  the onset of the southwest monsoon is driven by the shift of the subtropical westerly jet north from over the plains of india toward the tibetan plateau  this shift is due to the intense heating of the plateau during the summer months  the northward shift is not a slow and gradual process  as expected for most changes in weather pattern  the primary cause is believed to be the height of the himalayas  as the tibetan plateau heats up  the low pressure created over it pulls the westerly jet north  because of the lofty himalayas  the westerly jet s movement is inhibited  but with continuous dropping pressure  sufficient force is created for the movement of the westerly jet across the himalayas after a significant period  as such  the shift of the jet is sudden and abrupt  causing the bursting of southwest monsoon rains onto the indian plains  the reverse shift happens for the northeast monsoon the jet stream theory also explains the variability in timing and strength of the monsoon timing  a timely northward shift of the subtropical westerly jet at the beginning of summer is critical to the onset of the southwest monsoon over india  if the shift is delayed  so is the southwest monsoon  an early shift results in an early monsoon  strength  the strength of the southwest monsoon is determined by the strength of the easterly tropical jet over central india  a strong easterly tropical jet results in a strong southwest monsoon over central india  and a weak jet results in a weak monsoon el niño is a warm ocean current originating along the coast of peru that replaces the usual cold humboldt current  the warm surface water moving toward the coast of peru with el niño is pushed west by the trade winds  thereby raising the temperature of the southern pacific ocean  the reverse condition is known as la niña southern oscillation  a phenomenon first observed by sir gilbert thomas walker  director general of observatories in india  refers to the seesaw relationship of atmospheric pressures between tahiti and darwin  walker noticed that when pressure was high in tahiti  it was low in darwin  and vice a southern oscillation index  soi   based on the pressure difference between tahiti and darwin  has been formulated by the bureau of meteorology  australia  to measure the strength of the walker noticed that the quantity of rainfall in the indian subcontinent was often negligible in years of high pressure over darwin  and low pressure over tahiti   conversely  low pressure over darwin bodes well for precipitation quantity in india  thus  walker established the relationship between southern oscillation and quantities of monsoon rains in the southern oscillation was found to be simply an atmospheric component of the el niño la niña effect  which happens in the therefore  in the context of the monsoon  the two together came to be known as the el niño-southern  oscillation  enso  effect  the effect is known to have a pronounced influence on the strength of the southwest monsoon over india  with the monsoon being weak  causing droughts  during el niño years  while la niña years bring particularly strong the enso effect was statistically effective in explaining several past droughts in india  in recent decades  its relationship with the indian monsoon seemed to for example  the strong enso of 1997  did not cause drought in however  it was later discovered that  just like enso in the pacific ocean  a similar seesaw ocean-atmosphere  system in the indian ocean was also in play  this system was discovered in 1999  and named the indian ocean dipole  iod   an index to calculate it was also formulated  iod develops in the equatorial region of the indian ocean from april to may and peaks in with a positive iod  winds over the indian ocean blow from east to west  this makes the arabian sea  the western indian ocean near the african coast  much warmer and the eastern indian ocean around indonesia colder and in negative dipole years  the reverse happens  making indonesia much warmer and rainier a positive iod index often negates the effect of enso  resulting in increased monsoon rains in years such as 1983,  1994,  and further  the two poles of the iod — the eastern pole  around indonesia  and the western pole  off the african coast  — independently and cumulatively affect the quantity of monsoon with enso  the atmospheric component of the iod was later discovered and the cumulative phenomenon named equatorial indian ocean oscillation when equinoo effects are factored in  certain failed forecasts  like the acute drought of 2002,  can be further accounted the relationship between extremes of the indian summer monsoon rainfall  along with enso and have been studied  and models to better predict the quantity of monsoon rains have been statistically 1950s,  the south asian summer monsoon underwent a gradual decline  with a reduction of up to 10%  over central this is primarily due to a weakening monsoon circulation as a result of the rapid warming in the indian and changes in land use and land since the strength of the monsoon is partially dependent on the temperature difference between the ocean and the land  higher ocean temperatures in the indian ocean have weakened the moisture bearing winds from the ocean to the land  the reduction in the summer monsoon rainfall have grave consequences over central india because at least 60%  of the agriculture in this region is still largely rain-fed.a  recent assessment of the monsoonal changes indicate that the land warming has increased during 2002-2014,  possibly reviving the strength of the monsoon circulation and future changes in the monsoon will depend on a competition between land and ocean—on which is warming faster than the other meanwhile  there has been a three-fold  rise in widespread extreme rainfall events during the years 1950  to 2015,  over the entire central belt of india  leading to a steady rise in the number of flash floods with significant socioeconomic widespread extreme rainfall events are those rainfall events which are larger than 150  mm day and spread over a region large enough to cause floods since the great famine of 1876–78  in india  various attempts have been made to predict monsoon at least five prediction models centre for development of advanced computing  cdac  at bengaluru facilitated the seasonal prediction of indian monsoon  spim  experiment on the param padma supercomputing this project involved simulated runs of historical data from 1985  to 2004  to try to establish the relationship of five atmospheric general circulation models with monsoon rainfall department has tried to forecast the monsoon for india since and is the only official agency entrusted with making public forecasts about the quantity  distribution  and timing of the monsoon rains  its position as the sole authority on the monsoon was cemented in by the department of science and technology  dst   new delhi  in 2003,  imd substantially changed its forecast methodology  and a sixteen-parameter  monsoon forecasting model used since 1988  was replaced in however  following the 2009  drought in india  worst since the department decided in 2010  that it needed to develop an  indigenous to further improve its prediction capabilities the monsoon is the primary delivery mechanism for fresh water in the indian subcontinent  as such  it affects the environment  and associated flora  fauna  and ecosystems   agriculture  society  hydro-power  production  and geography of the subcontinent  like the availability of fresh water in water bodies and the underground water table   with all of these factors cumulatively contributing to the health of the economy of affected countries the monsoon turns large parts of india from semi-deserts  into green grasslands  see photos taken only three months apart in the western ghats mawsynram and cherrapunji  both in the indian state of meghalaya  alternate as the wettest places on earth given the quantity of their though there are other cities with similar claims  they receive more than 11,000  millimeters of rain each from the monsoon in india  which has historically had a primarily agrarian economy  the services sector recently overtook the farm sector in terms of gdp contribution  however  the agriculture sector still contributes 17-20%  of and is the largest employer in the country  with about 60%  of indians dependent on it for employment and about 49%  of india s land is agricultural  that number rises to 55%  if associated wetlands  dryland farming areas  etc   are included  because more than half of these farmlands are rain-fed,  the monsoon is critical to food sufficiency and quality of life despite progress in alternative forms of irrigation  agricultural dependence on the monsoon remains far from insignificant  therefore  the agricultural calendar of india is governed by the monsoon  any fluctuations in the time distribution  spatial distribution  or quantity of the monsoon rains may lead to floods or droughts  causing the agricultural sector to suffer  this has a cascading effect on the secondary economic sectors  the overall economy  food inflation  and therefore the general population s quality and cost of living the economic significance of the monsoon is aptly described by pranab mukherjee s remark that the monsoon is the  real finance minister of a good monsoon results in better agricultural yields  which brings down prices of essential food commodities and reduces imports  thus reducing food inflation better rains also result in increased hydroelectric all of these factors have positive ripple effects throughout the economy of down side however is that when monsoon rains are weak  crop production is low leading to higher food prices with limited as a result  the indian government is actively working with farmers and the nation s meteorological department to produce more drought resistant subbarao  governor of the reserve bank of india  emphasized during a quarterly review of india s monetary policy that the lives of indians depend on the performance of the his own career prospects  his emotional well-being,  and the performance of his monetary policy are all  a hostage  to the monsoon  he said  as is the case for most additionally  farmers rendered jobless by failed monsoon rains tend to migrate to cities  this crowds city slums and aggravates the infrastructure and sustainability of city the past  indians usually refrained from traveling during monsoons for practical as well as religious reasons  but with the advent of globalization  such travel is gaining popularity  places like kerala and the western ghats get a large number of tourists  both local and foreigners  during the monsoon season  kerala is one of the top destinations for tourists interested in ayurvedic treatments and massage therapy  one major drawback of traveling during the monsoon is that most wildlife sanctuaries are closed  also  some mountainous areas  especially in himalayan regions  get cut off when roads are damaged by landslides and floods during heavy monsoon is the primary bearer of fresh water to the area  the peninsular deccan rivers of india are mostly rain-fed  and non-perennial  in nature  depending primarily on the monsoon for water most of the coastal rivers of western india are also rain-fed  and as such  the flora  fauna  and entire ecosystems of these areas rely heavily on the needed
