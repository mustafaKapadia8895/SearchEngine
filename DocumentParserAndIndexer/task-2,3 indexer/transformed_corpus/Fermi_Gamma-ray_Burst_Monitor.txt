 the fermi gamma-ray  space telescope formerly called the gamma-ray  large area space telescope  glast   is a space observatory being used to perform gamma-ray  astronomy observations from low earth orbit  its main instrument is the large area telescope  lat   with which astronomers mostly intend to perform an all-sky  survey studying astrophysical and cosmological phenomena such as active galactic nuclei  pulsars  other high-energy  sources and dark matter  another instrument aboard fermi  the gamma-ray  burst monitor  gbm  formerly glast burst monitor   is being used to study gamma-ray  was launched on 11  june 2008  at 16:05  utc aboard a delta ii 7920-h  rocket  the mission is a joint venture of nasa  the united states department of energy  and government agencies in france  germany  italy  japan  and it is the most sensitive gamma-ray  observatory in orbit  succeeding esa s integral satellite fermi includes two scientific instruments  the large area telescope  lat  and the gamma-ray  burst monitor  gbm  general dynamics advanced information systems  formerly spectrum astro and now orbital sciences  in gilbert  arizona designed and built the spacecraft that carries the it travels in a low  circular orbit with a period of about 95  minutes  its normal mode of operation maintains its orientation so that the instruments will look away from the earth  with a  rocking  motion to equalize the coverage of the sky  the view of the instruments will sweep out across most of the sky about 16  times per day  the spacecraft can also maintain an orientation that points to a chosen target both science instruments underwent environmental testing  including vibration  vacuum  and high and low temperatures to ensure that they can withstand the stresses of launch and continue to operate in space  they were integrated with the spacecraft at the general dynamics ascent facility in gilbert  from the instruments are available to the public through the fermi science support center web software for analyzing the data is also gained its new name in 2008:  on 26  august 2008,  glast was renamed the  fermi gamma-ray  space telescope  in honor of enrico fermi  a pioneer in high-energy  alan stern  associate administrator for science at nasa headquarters  launched a public competition 7  february 2008,  closing 31  march 2008,  to rename glast in a way that would  capture the excitement of glast s mission and call attention to gamma-ray  and high-energy  astronomy     something memorable to commemorate this spectacular new astronomy mission     a name that is catchy  easy to say and will help make the satellite and its mission a topic of dinner table and classroom designed the mission with a five-year  lifetime  with a goal of ten years of key scientific objectives of the fermi mission have been described national academies of sciences ranked this mission as a top many new possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from this single mission and greatly expand our view of the 4  march 2008,  the spacecraft arrived at the astrotech payload processing facility in titusville  on 4  june 2008,  after several previous delays  launch status was retargeted for 11  june at the the last delays resulting from the need to replace the flight termination system the launch window extended from 15:45  to 17:40  utc daily  until 7  august occurred successfully on 11  june 2008  at 16:05  utc aboard a delta 7920h-10c  rocket from cape canaveral air force station space launch complex 17-b.  spacecraft separation took place about 75  minutes after launch fermi resides in a low-earth  circular orbit at an altitude of 550  km (340  mi   and at an inclination of 28.5  received some minor modifications to its computer software on 23  june 2008.computers  operating both the lat and gbm and most of the lat s components were turned on 24  june 2008.  the lat high voltage was turned on 25  june  and it began detecting high-energy  particles from space  but minor adjustments were still needed to calibrate the instrument  the gbm high voltage was also turned on 25  june  but the gbm still required one more week of testing calibrations before searching for gamma-ray  bursts after presenting an overview of the fermi instrumentation and goals  jennifer carson of slac national accelerator laboratory had concluded that the primary goals were  all achievable with the all-sky  scanning mode of fermi switched to  sky survey mode  on 26  june 2008  so as to begin sweeping its field of view over the entire sky every three hours  every two orbits  on 30  april 2013,  nasa revealed that the telescope had narrowly avoided a collision a year earlier with a defunct cold war-era  soviet spy satellite  kosmos 1805,  in april 2012.  orbital predictions several days earlier indicated that the two satellites were expected to occupy the same point in space within 30  milliseconds of each other  on 3  april  telescope operators decided to stow the satellite s high-gain  parabolic antenna  rotate the solar panels out of the way and to fire fermi s rocket thrusters for one second to move it out of the way  even though the thrusters had been idle since the telescope had been placed in orbit nearly five years earlier  they worked correctly and potential disaster was thus august 2013  fermi started its 5-year  mission first major discovery came when the space telescope detected a pulsar in the cta 1  supernova remnant that appeared to emit radiation in the gamma ray bands only  a first for its this new pulsar sweeps the earth every 316.86  milliseconds and is about 4,600  light years september 2008,  the gamma-ray  burst grb 080916c  in the constellation carina was recorded by the fermi telescope  this burst is notable as having â€œthe largest apparent energy release yet the explosion had the power of about 9,000  ordinary supernovae  and the relativistic jet of material ejected in the blast must have moved at a minimum of 99.9999%  the speed of light  overall  grb 080916c  had  the greatest total energy  the fastest motions  and the highest initial-energy  emissions  ever february it was announced that fermi-lat  had determined that supernova remnants act as enormous accelerators for cosmic particles  this determination fulfills one of the stated missions for this march 2010  it was announced that active galactic nuclei are not responsible for most gamma-ray  background though active galactic nuclei do produce some of the gamma-ray  radiation detected here on earth  less than 30%  originates from these sources  the search now is to locate the sources for the remaining 70%  or so of all gamma-rays  detected  possibilities include star forming galaxies  galactic mergers  and yet-to-be  explained dark matter interactions in november 2010,  it was announced two gamma-ray  and x-ray  bubbles were detected around earth s galaxy  the milky the bubbles  named fermi bubbles  extend about 25  thousand light years distant above and below the center of the the galaxy s diffuse gamma-ray  fog hampered prior observations  but the discovery team led by d  finkbeiner  building on research by g  dobler  worked around this of x-ray/gamma-ray  bubbles of the milky wayvideo  the milky way s x-ray/gamma-ray  bubblesin early 2012,  fermi glast observed the highest energy light ever seen in a solar the flare s peak  the lat detected gamma rays with two billion times the energy of visible light  or about four billion electron volts  gev   easily setting a record for the highest-energy  light ever detected during or immediately after a solar flarefermi telescope has observed and detected numerous terrestrial gamma-ray  flashes and discovered that such flashes can produce 100  trillion positrons  far more than scientists had previously 27  april 2013,  fermi detected grb 130427a,  a gamma-ray  burst with one of the highest energy outputs yet this included detection of a gamma-ray  over 94  billion electron volts this broke fermi s previous record detection  by over three times the reported that its gbm instrument detected a weak gamma-ray  burst above 50  kev  starting 0.4  seconds after the ligo event and with a positional uncertainty region overlapping that of the ligo observation  the fermi team calculated the odds of such an event being the result of a coincidence or noise at however  observations from the integral telescope s all-sky  spi-acs  instrument indicated that any energy emission in gamma-rays  and hard x-rays  from the event was less than one millionth of the energy emitted as gravitational waves  concluding that  this limit excludes the possibility that the event is associated with substantial gamma-ray  radiation  directed towards the observer   if the signal observed by the fermi gbm was genuinely astrophysical  spi-acs  would have detected it with a significance of 15  sigma above the the agile space telescope also did not detect a gamma-ray  counterpart of the a follow-up  analysis of the fermi report by an independent group  released in june 2016,  identified statistical flaws in the initial analysis  and concluded that the observation was consistent with a hole mergers of the type thought to have produced the gravitational wave event are not expected to produce gamma-ray  bursts  as stellar-mass  black hole binaries are not expected to have large amounts of orbiting matter  avi loeb has theorised that if a massive star is rapidly rotating  the centrifugal force produced during its collapse will lead to the formation of a rotating bar that breaks into two dense clumps of matter with a dumbbell configuration that becomes a black hole binary  and at the end of the star s collapse it triggers a gamma-ray  loeb suggests that the 0.4  second delay is the time it took the gamma-ray  burst to cross the star  relative to the gravitational 17  august 2017,  fermi gamma-ray  burst monitor software detected  classified  and localized a gamma-ray  burst which was later designated as grb 170817a.  six minutes later  a single detector at hanford ligo registered a gravitational-wave  candidate which was consistent with a binary neutron star merger  occurring 2  seconds before the grb 170817a  event  this observation was  the first joint detection of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation from a single gamma-ray  burst monitor  gbm   formerly glast burst monitor  detects sudden flares of gamma-rays  produced by gamma ray bursts and solar flares  its scintillators are on the sides of the spacecraft to view all of the sky which is not blocked by the earth  the design is optimized for good resolution in time and photon energy."gamma-ray  bursts are so bright we can see them from billions of light years away  which means they occurred billions of years ago  and we see them as they looked then   stated charles meegan of nasa s marshall space flight gamma-ray  burst monitor has detected gamma rays from positrons generated in powerful large area telescope  lat  detects individual gamma rays using technology similar to that used in terrestrial particle accelerators  photons hit thin metal sheets  converting to electron-positron  pairs  via a process known as pair production  these charged particles pass through interleaved layers of silicon microstrip detectors  causing ionization which produce detectable tiny pulses of electric charge  researchers can combine information from several layers of this tracker to determine the path of the particles  after passing through the tracker  the particles enter the calorimeter  which consists of a stack of caesium iodide scintillator crystals to measure the total energy of the particles  the lat s field of view is large  about 20%  of the sky  the resolution of its images is modest by astronomical standards  a few arc minutes for the highest-energy  photons and about 3  degrees at 100  mev  the lat is a bigger and better successor to the egret instrument on nasa s compton gamma ray observatory satellite in the 1990s.  several countries produced the components of the lat  who then sent the components for assembly at slac national accelerator laboratory  slac also hosts the lat instrument science operations center  which supports the operation of the lat during the fermi mission for the lat scientific collaboration and for nasa education and public outreach are important components of the fermi project  the main fermi education and public outreach website at
