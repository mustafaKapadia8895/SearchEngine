 anticyclogenesis is the development or strengthening of anticyclonic circulation in the atmosphere  it is the opposite of anticyclolysis  and has a cyclonic anticyclones are alternatively referred to as high pressure systems  high pressure areas form due to downward motion through the troposphere  the atmospheric layer where weather occurs  preferred areas within a synoptic flow pattern in higher levels of the troposphere are beneath the western side of troughs  on weather maps  these areas show converging winds  isotachs   also known as confluence  or converging height lines near or above the level of non-divergence,  which is near the 500  hpa pressure surface about midway up through the on weather maps  high pressure centers are associated with the letter on constant pressure upper level charts  it is located within the highest height line systems form due to downward motion through the troposphere  the atmospheric layer where weather occurs  preferred areas within a synoptic flow pattern in higher levels of the troposphere are beneath the western side of troughs  on weather maps  these areas show converging winds  isotachs   also known as confluence  or converging height lines near or above the level of non-divergence,  which is near the 500  hpa pressure surface about midway up through the high-pressure  systems are alternatively referred to as anticyclones  on weather maps  high-pressure  centers are associated with the letter placed within the isobar with the highest pressure value  on constant pressure upper level charts  it is located within the highest height line
