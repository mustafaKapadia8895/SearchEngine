 the cape fold belt is a fold and thrust belt of late paleozoic age  which affected the sequence of sedimentary rock layers of the cape supergroup in the southwestern corner of south it was originally continuous with the ventana mountains near bahía blanca in argentina  the pensacola mountains  east antarctica   the ellsworth mountains  west antarctica  and the hunter-bowen  orogeny in eastern australia  the rocks involved are generally sandstones and shales  with the shales  bokkeveld group  persisting in the valley floors while the erosion resistant sandstones  belonging to the peninsula formation  form the parallel ranges  the cape fold mountains  which reach a maximum height of 2325  m at seweweekspoortpiek  ‘seven weeks defile peak’ in afrikaans  the cape fold mountains form a series of parallel ranges that run along the south-western  and southern coastlines of south africa for 850  km from the cederberg 200  km to the north of the cape peninsula  and then along the south coast as far as port elizabeth  650  km to the east  see the two maps one above the other on the right  the rocks were laid down as sediments in a rift valley that developed in southern gondwana  just south of southern africa  during the cambrian-ordovician  periods  starting about 510  million years ago  and ending about 330-350  million years  see the yellow block labeled c on the earth s geological timeline diagram on the right   an 8-km-thick  layer of sediment  known as the cape supergroup  see below   accumulated on the floor of this rift closure of the rift valley  starting 330  million years ago  resulted from the development of a subduction zone along the southern margin of gondwana  and the consequent drift of the falkland plateau back towards africa  during the carboniferous and early permian periods  after closure of the rift valley  and rucking of the cape supergroup into a series of parallel folds  running mainly east-west   with a short section running north-south  in the west  due to collision with eastward moving patagonia   the continued subduction of the paleo-pacific  plate beneath the falkland plateau and the resulting collision of the latter with southern africa  raised a mountain range of immense proportions to the south of the former rift valley  the folded cape supergroup formed the northern foothills of this towering mountain range the weight of the falkland-cape  supergroup mountains caused the continental crust of southern africa to sag  forming a retroarc foreland system  into which the karoo supergroup was eventually much of the cape supergroup became buried under these karoo deposits  only to re-emerge  as mountains when upliftment of the subcontinent  about 180  million years ago  and again 20  million years ago  started an episode of continuous erosion that was to remove many kilometers of surface deposits from southern although the tops of the original cape fold mountains were eroded away  they eroded much slower than the considerably softer karoo deposits to the north  thus the cape fold belt  erupted  from the eroding african landscape to form the parallel ranges of mountains that run for 800  km along the southern and south-western  cape coastline today  in fact  they form the coastline  either sloping steeply directly into the sea  or are separated from it by a relatively narrow coastal plain the falkland mountain range had probably eroded into relative insignificance by the mid-jurassic  period  and started drifting to the south-west  soon after gondwana began to break up 150  million years ago  leaving the cape fold belt to edge the southern portion of the newly formed african continent  even though the mountains are very old by andean and alpine standards  they remain steep and rugged due to their quartzitic sandstone geology  see below  making them very resistant to weathering  the famous table mountain forms part of the cape fold belt  being made up of the local lowest  oldest  strata of the cape supergroup  composed predominantly of quartzitic sandstone which forms the impressive  almost vertical cliffs which characterize the mountain and the rest of the range which constitutes the backbone of the cape degree to which the original cape fold mountains  formed during the carboniferous and early permian periods  have been eroded is attested to by the fact that the 1  km high table mountain on the cape peninsula is a syncline mountain  meaning that it formed part of the bottom of a valley when the cape supergroup was initially folded  the anticline  or highest elevation of the fold between table mountain and the hottentots-holland  mountains (1.2  to 1.6  km elevation   on the opposite side of the isthmus connecting the peninsula to the mainland  has been eroded away  the malmesbury shale and granite basement on which this anticline mountain rested also formed an anticline  but being composed of much softer rocks  readily eroded into a 50  km wide flat plain   now covered with dune sands  called the  cape cape fold belt  i e  the mountain ranges  extends from about clanwilliam  approximately 200  km north of cape town   to about port elizabeth  approximately 650  km east of cape town   the cape supergroup sediments beyond these points are not folded into mountain ranges  but do  in places  form steep cliffs or gorges  where the surrounding sediments have been eroded away  see  for instance  oribi gorge in mountains  although only of moderate height  are majestic and dramatic  this is due in part to numerous geological factors  the ranges usually have few to no foothills and rise directly from valley floors  the bases of the mountains are usually at or near sea mountains of the cape fold belt are composed of rocks belonging to the cape supergroup  which is more extensive than the fold belt  the supergroup is divided into several distinct groups the western and southern extents of the supergroup have been folded into a series of longitudinal mountain ranges  by the collision of the falkland plateau into what would later become south africa  see diagrams on the left   however  the entire suite in this region slopes downwards towards the north and east  so that the oldest rocks are exposed in the south and west  while the youngest members of the supergroup are exposed in the north  where the entire cape supergroup dives beneath the karoo rocks  drilling in the karoo has established that cape supergroup rocks are found below the surface up to approximately 150  km north of their northernmost exposure on the cape supergroup extends eastwards beyond the fold belt into the eastern cape and northern kwazulu-natal,  where no folding took initial sedimentation into the rift valley which developed in southern gondwana  see diagram at top left  was confined to the western and eastern ends of the rift  rivers diverted into these early rifts deposited sand and gravel to form the klipheuwel group in the west  and the natal group in the these formations contain no fossils  today the klipheuwel group is exposed in several small patches near lamberts bay  piketberg  and to the south-west  of paarl natal group  which is similar to the table mountain group  see below   is found in several elongated patches near the coast of the northern eastern cape and kwazulu-natal.  it forms the impressive cliffs of oribi gorge  and can also be seen in a road cutting between durban and pietermaritzburg  particularly at the marian hill toll most of the group has been deeply eroded by numerous rivers creating the ragged plateaus and scarps of the durban-pietermaritzburg  the widening and deepening of the rift valley  the entire southern portion of what was to become south africa  as far as a line extending from calvinia in the west to east london in the east  plus the kwazulu-natal  coastline  became leading to a seaway across the southern and eastern parts of the country  called the agulhas the sea floor consisted of the klipheuwel group in the west  the natal group in the east  and eroded pre-cambrian  rocks in first sediments into the initially still shallow  possibly inland  sea were alternating layers of maroon colored mudstones and buff colored sandstones  each mostly between 10  and 30  cm the mudstone units commonly display ripple marks from the ebb and flow of tidal currents  as well as polygonal sand-filled  mud cracks that indicate occasional exposure to this layer  known as the graafwater formation  reaches a maximum thickness of 400  but on the cape peninsula it is only 60–70  m no fossils have been found in the graafwater rocks  but shallow-water  animal tracks have been a particularly good example of these tracks can be viewed in the foyer of geology department of the university of stellenbosch  where a slab of graafwater rock from the cederberg mountains has been built into the cutting for chapman’s peak drive  on the cape peninsula  is carved into the graafwater formation which overlays the cape granite basement rock below the road  the graafwater formation can also be clearly seen in the cutting on the second hairpin bend as the ou kaapse weg  road  goes up the slope from westlake on to the silvermine plateau  in the cutting one can also see the abrupt and obvious transition into the peninsula formation above it  looking up the slope from below to the first hairpin bend  the granite basement on which the graafwater formation rests is visible  and in the cutting at the first hairpin bend  the ocher-colored,  gritty clay into which the granite weathers is clearly displayed with further subsidence of the rift valley floor  and possibly breaking through to the ocean  the sediments abruptly become more sandy  indicative of a sudden increase in the depth of the agulhas sea  see photograph on the right   a deposit  known as the peninsula formation  also often referred to as table mountain sandstone   consisting of thickly layered quartzitic sandstone  with a maximum thickness of 2000  m  was laid down  these sandstones are very hard  and erosion resistant  they therefore form the bulk of mountains and steep cliffs and rugged crags of the cape fold belt  including the upper 600  m of the 1  km high table mountain  below which cape town is situated  it contains no fossils the peninsula formation can be traced from 300  km north of cape town  i e  about 50  km north of vanrhynsdorp on the west coast   southwards to cape town and then eastwards to northern kwazulu-natal,  a total distance of approximately 1800  km  roughly along the south african only the section between clanwilliam  approximately 200  km north of cape town  and port elizabeth  approximately 650  km east of cape town  is folded into the cape fold mountains during the laying down of the peninsula formation sediments  the western portion of the region was covered for a brief period of time by glaciers  the diamictite sediments that were laid down by these glaciers  or in glacial lakes  are known as the pakhuis and cederberg a small patch of pakhuis tillite occurs on the top of table mountain at maclear’s but most of the pakhuis and cederberg formations are found as a thin layer  on average only about 60  m in the peninsula formation rocks of the more inland mountains to the west of a line between swellendam and these diamictite rocks are composed of finely ground mud  containing a jumble of faceted pebbles  they can easily be recognized at a distance as this formation readily erodes into fertile  gently sloping  green swaths in a landscape where this contrasts starkly with the bare rocky surfaces of the quartzites above and in several locations the quartzites below the glacial horizon have been rucked into a series of folds  this is believed to have been caused by the movement of ice ploughing into the underlying unconsolidated a good example of this can be seen on a ridge of rocks near maclear’s beacon on table mountain  close to the edge of the plateau overlooking the cape town city bowl and table bay the pakhuis formation is also well exposed on the road along michell’s pass just below the and especially on the pakhuis pass near clanwilliam  from which the formation derives its glaciers which formed the pakhuis and cederberg formations came from the north west  in the direction of the south pole which was located in the neighborhood of cameroon at the upper peninsula formation  above the pakhuis and cederberg formations  consists of much softer sandstone than the lower peninsula formation  and is often referred to as the nardouw in the cederberg this formation has been eroded by the wind into a wide variety of  sculptures   caves  and other fascinating structures for which these mountains have become 400  million years ago  in the early devonian period  there was further subsidence of the rift valley floor  this brought about the deposition of deeper-water,  fine grained sediments of the bokkeveld group  this is in marked contrast to the predominantly sandy sediments of the table mountain group  the bokkeveld group consists predominantly the cape supergroup had been folded into the cape fold mountains  these soft mudstones readily washed away from the mountain tops  and only remain in the valleys  here they form the fertile soils on which the vineyards and fruit orchards of the western cape flourish with the help of irrigation from the rivers that have their sources in the surrounding bokkeveld group does not extend on to the cape peninsula or its isthmus  the cape flats   here the stellenbosch  franschhoek  paarl  durbanville  tulbagh and constantia vineyards have been planted on the weathered cape granite and malmesbury shale soils  which form the basement rocks on which the cape supergroup rocks in this region rest the bokkeveld group extends eastwards to port alfred  near grahamstown   approximately 120  km beyond the eastern extent of the cape fold bulk of the fossils found in the cape supergroup occur in the bokkeveld mudstones  they include a variety of brachiopods  as well as trilobites  molluscs  echinoderms  including starfish  crinoids  and the extinct blastoids and cystoids   foraminifera and fish with jaws upper layers of the bokkeveld group become increasingly more sandy  grading into the sandstone of the witteberg group  named for the range of mountains to the south of matjiesfontein and laingsburg in the southern karoo  these rocks were laid down 370  -  330  million years ago in the silted up  and therefore shallow marine conditions of what remained of the agulhas the group contains fewer fossils than the bokkeveld group  but the assemblage that is preserved includes primitive fish  an extinct species of shark  brachiopods  bivalves  and a meter long sea scorpion  there are also plant fossils and numerous animal the witteberg group is truncated by the overlying dwyka sediments of glacial origin  the latter forms part of the karoo supergroup  therefore  the witteberg group forms the uppermost layer of the cape supergroup  it tends to form the most inland outcrops of the cape supergroup  and can be traced eastwards as far as the bokkeveld group can be traced  i e  to port alfred   about 120  km beyond the cape fold bokkeveld and witteberg groups do not occur in the north-eastern  eastern cape and kwazulu-natal,  where the cape supergroup is represent only by the natal group and a trace of the peninsula formation  without the intervening graafwater witteberg sediments were laid down in what remained of the agulhas sea -  a shallow  much reduced expanse of water compared to its size during the bokkeveld immediately following the witteberg period  about 330  million years ago  much of gondwana  particularly what was to become africa and antarctica  but also parts of south america and india  became covered in a kilometers thick layer of ice as the super-continent  drifted over the south the diamictite deposits left by these glaciers form the first layer of the karoo supergroup  called the dwyka group  during the glaciation period the falkland plateau started to move northwards into what was to become southern africa  closing the depression that had been the agulhas sea  and rucking the cape supergroup sediments into folds running roughly parallel to what would ultimately become the south-western  and southern coastlines of south africa  this mountain building continued into the next phase of the karoo sedimentation  which began about 260  million years ago  after the ice sheets had melted  leaving a large lake  the karoo sea  extending over much of south africa  the resulting marine or lacustrine deposits form the karoo s ecca group  during these ecca times continued collision of the falkland plateau into southern africa  and subduction of oceanic crust under the plateau caused the formation of a range of mountains of himalayan proportions to the south of south the cape fold mountains became fully formed during this period to become the northern foothills of this enormous mountain range  the folding that occurred during this period therefore involved not only the cape supergroup sediments  but also the southern portions of the dwyka and ecca groups of the karoo the time gondwana broke up about 150  million years ago  the falkland mountains had been all but eroded away  before drifting south-westwards  to their present position off the coast of southern south america  close to cape horn  leaving behind only the submarine agulhas bank along the southern coastline of africa   the cape fold mountains possibly survived erosional obliteration  firstly because of the extremely hard rocks  the peninsula formation sandstone  that form the backbone of the mountain chains  but also possibly because they had become buried under the karoo deposits which originated in the falkland mountains  thus traces of karoo deposits can  for instance  be found in the worcester-robertson  valley in the middle of the fold the dwyka and ecca sediments adjoining the cape fold mountains were subjected to the same compression forces that gave rise to the cape mountains  they do not form the same mountain ranges as do the cape fold mountains  this is because they are composed of much softer rocks than the peninsula formation sandstone  and were thus soon eroded into the flat plains of the  lower karoo   except where they were protected by hard  erosion resistant dolerite or turbidite caps  to form isolated mountains that stand out from the mountains are not particularly ancient  despite their old-looking  appearance  they are considered middle-aged  in geologic terms  they were created when the falkland plateau collided with southern africa  when pangaea  the supercontinent formed during the cambrian-ordovician  periods  from 510  to about 330-350  million years their stature  with heights varying from 1000m  to 2300m,  is mostly due to the weather-resistant  rocks of quartzitic sandstone of the peninsula group  see above  they occur in long parallel ranges each not much more than 10  km wide  separated by equally long valleys with a maximum width of about 50  km  mostly only 15–30  km wide   almost all of these ranges consist of hard erosion resistant peninsula group rocks  the valleys tend to be floored by bokkeveld group mudstones  a remarkable feature of these ranges is that the 1500  m high mountains  from base to crest  are cut through by very narrow  almost vertically walled defiles  not much more than 50–70  m wide at the bottom  through which rivers flow from the inland great escarpment to the sea  it is from within these narrow defiles  many of which can be traveled by road  that one is afforded a cross sectional view of the mountains  and can appreciate their intense folding and distortion  see the photographs on the top right above   their origin is as follows after the fold mountains had been formed they became buried under sediments derived from the massive himalaya-sized  falkland mountains to the south of the cape fold sediments eroded from these mountains provided the bulk of the 6  km thick beaufort sediments in the karoo but they also covered the cape fold belt  thereby protecting them from erosion  at the end of the karoo period about 180  million years ago  the subcontinent was covered by a thick layer of drakensberg lavas  an event that was accompanied by upliftment or bulging of southern africa  ushering in an almost uninterrupted period  continuing to the present  of erosion removing many kilometers of surface rocks from the entire rivers running off this bulging interior into the seas that were forming around south africa as gondwana was breaking up 150  million years ago  eventually encountered rocky ridges as the protective layer over the cape fold belt eroded away  exposing their mountain tops  the rivers breached these ridges  after possibly being dammed back for a short period  creating a narrow passage through the low rocky barrier  continued erosion exposed more and more of these quartzitic mountain ranges  but the rivers  now confined to narrow  fast flowing gorges  continued breaking through each barrier as the surrounding landscape eroded to lower and lower levels  particularly during the past 20  million 150‑million-year-old  rivers therefore cut the defile  starting by flowing over  and then through the gradually erupting cape fold mountains  to form the spectacular “poorte” and “klowe”  plural of “poort” and “kloof”  the afrikaans for defile or chasm  that characterize these mountains today  the best known defiles are  meiringspoort  seweweekspoort  the tradouw pass  kogmanskloof  garcia’s pass  the gourits river gorge  which does not have a road running through it   and michell s pass  which is  however  more v-shaped  than the others  but impressive nevertheless  in addition several roads and highways crest the mountains over cols  or go through them via tunnels a number of parallel faults still run roughly parallel with the coast  having formed during the gondwana rifting when south america and the falkland plateau separated from africa  patagonia was to the west of cape town and the falkland islands were to the south during the jurassic period prior to separation  most of these faults are inactive today  but in 1969  the towns of ceres and tulbagh  about 160  km north-east  of cape town  were severely damaged by an earthquake  originating from movement of the northern end of the worcester major  inactive  fault line runs for 300  km along the southern edge of the swartberg mountains  the swartberg mountains were uplifted along this fault  to such an extent that in the oudtshoorn region the rocks that form the base of the cape supergroup are exposed  these are locally known as the  cango group   but are probably continuous with the  malmesbury group  that forms the base of table mountain on the cape peninsula  and similar outcrops in the western in the little karoo the outcrop is composed of limestone  into which an underground stream has carved the impressively extensive cango following is a list of the largest individual ranges within the cape fold belt include from west to east   translations in brackets  berg is afrikaans for mountain  its
