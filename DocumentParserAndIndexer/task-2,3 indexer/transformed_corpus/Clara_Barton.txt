in this town i was born  in this church i was reared  in all its reconstructions and remodelings i have taken a part  and i look anxiously for a time in the near future when the busy world will let me once more become a living part of its people  praising god for the advance in the liberal faith of the religions of the world today  so largely due to the teachings of this belief give  i pray you
