 category 4  hurricanes are tropical cyclones that reach category 4  intensity on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale  category 4  hurricanes that later attained category 5  strength are not included in this list  the atlantic basin includes the open waters of the atlantic ocean  the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico  category 4  is the second-highest  hurricane classification category on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale  and storms that are of this intensity maintain maximum sustained winds of 113–136  knots (130–156  mph  209–251  km h   based on the atlantic hurricane database  94  hurricanes have attained category 4  hurricane status since 1851,  the start of modern meteorological record keeping  category 4  storms are considered extreme hurricanes  hurricane ike  which was a category 4  storm  brought on a 24  ft storm surge  the third greatest storm surge ever recorded  after hurricane katrina and hurricane camille  respectively  category 4  hurricanes have maximum sustained winds of 113–136  knots (130–156  mph  209–251   sustained winds  refers to the average wind speed observed over one minute at a height of 10  meters (33  ft  above ground  gust can be 30%  higher than the sustained mobile homes and other buildings without fixed structures can be completely destroyed  and the lower floors of sturdier structures usually sustain major damage  in addition to the winds  the cyclones generally produce a storm surge of 13–18  feet (4–5.5  m  above normal  potentially causing major beach erosion  heavy  irreparable damage and or near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are also very common  and mobile and manufactured homes are often completely destroyed  low-level  terrain may be flooded well inland  as in addition  category 4  hurricanes are very often cape verde type hurricanes  cape verde hurricanes are usually the strongest  and their track sometimes points them towards the united states  or other have shown that the number of category 4  and 5  hurricanes nearly doubled in occurrence in from 1970  to also  due to growing population in major coastal cities  many areas have become more vulnerable to strong hurricanes  especially categories 4  and of the storms listed in this analysis are listed in chronological order  but they also list the minimum central pressure and maximum sustained winds  each of these meteorological readings are taken using a specific meteorological instrument  for modern storms  the minimum pressure measurements are taken by reconnaissance aircraft using dropsondes  or by determining it from satellite imagery using the dvorak technique  for older storms  pressures are often incomplete  typically being provided by ship-reports  or land-observations.  none of these methods can provide constant pressure measurements  thus it is possible the only measurement occurred when the cyclone was at a lesser sustained winds are taken using an anemometer at 10  meters (33  ft  above the total of 95  hurricanes in the atlantic ocean basin  including the gulf of mexico and the caribbean  have reached category 4  status as their peak intensity   note that category 4  storms that intensified later to category 5  status are not included in this analysis  most category 4  hurricanes occur during september  with 51  storms occurring in that month  this coincides with the average peak of the atlantic hurricane season  which occurs on september most category 4  hurricanes develop in the warm waters of the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea  several category 4  hurricanes are cape verde-type  hurricanes  there have been no category 4  hurricanes to form in either may or december  or in any other month outside the traditional bounds of the atlantic hurricane season all data listed is provided by the nhc best track  unless otherwise noted  also  some pressure readings for the older storms may have been taken at a time other than the storm s peak intensity  thus  some pressure readings might not be the minimum pressure some pressure readings are unavailable due to scarce information in the years between 1851  and 1900,  thirteen category 4  storms are known to have occurred in the atlantic ocean  these numbers are limited by the observation techniques used prior to the use of satellite imagery in the 1960s.between  1901  and 1950,  29  category 4  hurricanes formed in the atlantic basin in the years between 1951  and 1975,  there were 23  category 4  hurricanes in the atlantic ocean in the years between 1976  and 2000,  24  category 4  hurricanes formed in the basin in the years between 2001  and the present time  24  category 4  hurricanes formed within the confines of the atlantic ocean  a dagger    denotes that the storm temporarily weakened below category 4  intensity during the specified period of time the following hurricanes made landfall at some location at any strength  due to inaccuracies in data  tropical depression landfalls are not included  several of these storms weakened slightly after attaining category 4  status as they approached land  this is usually a result of dry air  shallower water due to shelving  cooler waters  or interaction with land
