across the region  producing heavy rainfall in portions of mexico and central america  on november 13,  the system became better organized  a hurricane hunters flight later that day discovered a surface circulation and winds of about 35  mph (56  km h   the data indicated the development of tropical depression sixteen at 1800  utc  about 175  mi (282  km  south of the cayman the depression s convection was fairly disorganized  and the national hurricane center  nhc  did not anticipate any strengthening for three for much of its existence  the tropical cyclone maintained a track from west to east across the caribbean sea  which was unprecedented in the atlantic hurricane database  earning it the nickname "left-hand  lenny   the path resulted from its movement along the southern end of a trough over the western atlantic its formation  the depression gradually became better the nhc upgraded it to tropical storm lenny on november based on reports from the hurricane hunters  when it

southwest of kingston  the quick intensification was unexpected and occurred after a large area of convection blossomed over the center  at the same time  lenny developed an anticyclone aloft  which provided favorable conditions for the hurricane s after moving east-southeastward  during its initial development stages  the hurricane turned more to the east on november 15.  the hurricane hunters reported winds of 100  mph (160  km h   which indicated that lenny had become a category 2  on the saffir-simpson  hurricane however  the cloud pattern subsequently became less organized as the eye disappeared  and lenny s winds weakened to 85  mph (137  km h  while the hurricane passed south of the nhc noted the deterioration could have been due to a disruption of the storm s small inner core by  subtle environmental changes   after the sudden the hurricane hunters reported that the eye had reformed and the hurricane s winds had reached 100  mph (160  km h   at the time  a ridge was expected to build to lenny s east and turn the storm northeastward into puerto rico 24  hours on november 16,  hurricane lenny underwent a 24-hour  period of rapid deepening  reaching major hurricane status about 165  mi (266  km  south of the mona it developed well-defined  banding features  good outflow  and a circular eye that was visible from the radar in san juan  puerto the hurricane

dropsonde wind speed recording in a hurricane at the the time it peaked in intensity  lenny s forward speed decreased in response to light steering currents between two ridges  despite favorable conditions for strengthening  the hurricane weakened as it turned to an eastward drift  possibly due to the upwelling of cooler waters  late on november 18,  lenny s eye moved over saint martin with winds of 125  mph (201  km h   after continued weakening  the hurricane struck anguilla and saint barthélemy the next day  it turned southeastward while still drifting  bringing heavy rainfall and
