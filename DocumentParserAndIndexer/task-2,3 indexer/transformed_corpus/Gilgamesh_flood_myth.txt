 the gilgamesh flood myth is a flood myth in the epic of gilgamesh  many scholars believe that the flood myth was added to tablet xi in the  standard version  of the gilgamesh epic by an editor who utilized the flood story from the epic of a short reference to the flood myth is also present in the much older sumerian gilgamesh poems  from which the later babylonian versions drew much of their inspiration and subject matter gilgamesh’s supposed historical reign is believed to have been approximately 2700  shortly before the earliest known written stories  the discovery of artifacts associated with aga and enmebaragesi of kish  two other kings named in the stories  has lent credibility to the historical existence of earliest sumerian gilgamesh poems date from as early as the third dynasty of ur (2100–2000  one of these poems mentions gilgamesh’s journey to meet the flood hero  as well as a short version of the flood the earliest akkadian versions of the unified epic are dated to ca  2000–1500  due to the fragmentary nature of these old babylonian versions  it is unclear whether they included an expanded account of the flood myth  although one fragment definitely includes the story of gilgamesh’s journey to meet utnapishtim  the “standard” akkadian version included a long version of the story and was edited by sin-liqe-unninni  sometime between 1300  and 1000  gilgamesh flood tablet xi contains additional story material besides the flood  the flood story was included because in it the flood hero utnapishtim is granted immortality by the gods and that fits the immortality theme of the epic  the main point seems to be that utnapishtim was granted eternal life in unique  never-to-be-repeated  circumstances  as if to demonstrate this point  utnapishtim challenges gilgamesh to stay awake for six days and seven nights  however  as soon as utnapishtim finishes speaking gilgamesh falls asleep  utnapishtim instructs his wife to bake a loaf of bread for every day he is asleep so that gilgamesh cannot deny his failure  gilgamesh  who wants to overcome death  cannot even conquer sleep as gilgamesh is leaving  utnapishtim s wife asks her husband to offer a parting gift  utnapishtim tells gilgamesh of a boxthorn-like  plant at the very bottom of the ocean that will make him young again  gilgamesh obtains the plant by binding stones to his feet so he can walk on the bottom of the sea  he recovers the plant and plans to test it on an old man when he returns to uruk  unfortunately  when gilgamesh stops to bathe it is stolen by a serpent that sheds its skin as it departs  apparently reborn  gilgamesh  having failed both chances  returns to uruk  where the sight of its massive walls provokes him to praise this enduring work of mortal men  the implication may be that mortals can achieve immortality through lasting works of civilization and culture lines 1-203,  tablet xi  note  with supplemental sub-titles  and line numbers added for clarity in addition to the flood story material   lines 1–203),  tablet xi contains the following flood story elements list of titled subparts  tablet xi-(by  are some of the sentences copied more or less directly from the atrahasis version to the gilgamesh epic of atrahasis provides additional information on the flood and flood hero that is omitted in gilgamesh xi and other versions of the ancient near east flood myth  according to atrahasis iii ii  lines 40–47  the flood hero was at a banquet when the storm and flood began   he invited his people     to a banquet     he sent his family on board  they ate and they drank  but he  atrahasis  was in and out  he could not sit  could not crouch  for his heart was broken and he was vomiting to tigay  atrahasis tablet iii iv  lines 6–9  clearly identify the flood as a local river flood   like dragonflies they bodies  have filled the river  like a raft they have moved in to the edge the boat   like a raft they have moved in to the riverbank   the sentence  like dragonflies they have filled the river   was changed in gilgamesh xi line 123  to  like the spawn of fishes  they fill the tigay holds that we can see the mythmaker s hand at work here  changing a local river flood into an ocean deluge most other authorities interpret the atrahasis flood as universal  a  r  george  and lambert and millard make it clear that the gods  intention in atrahasis is to  wipe out the flood destroys  all of the the use of a comparable metaphor in the gilgamesh epic suggests that the reference to  dragonflies the river  is simply an evocative image of death rather than a literal description of the however  the local river flood in atrahasis could accomplish destruction of all  mankind  and  all of the earth  if the scope of  mankind  is limited to all of the people living on  all of the land  of the flood plains in the lower river valley known to the atrahasis needed other editorial changes were made to the atrahasis text in gilgamesh to lessen the suggestion that the gods may have experienced human needs  for example  atrahasis ob iii  30–31   the anunnaki  the great gods sitt ing in thirst and hunger  was changed in gilgamesh xi  line 113  to  the gods feared the deluge   sentences in atrahasis iii iv were omitted in gilgamesh  e g   she was surfeited with grief and thirsted for beer  and  from hunger they were suffering and other editorial changes to atrahasis are documented and described in the book by prof  tigay  see below  who is associate professor of hebrew and semitic languages and literature in the university of pennsylvania  prof  tigay comments   the dropping of individual lines between others which are preserved  but are not synonymous with them  appears to be a more deliberate editorial act  these lines share a common theme  the hunger and thirst of the gods during the the 18th  century bc copy of the atrahasis (atra-hasis)  epic post-dates  the early gilgamesh epic  we do not know whether the old-akkadian  gilgamesh tablets included the flood story  because of the fragmentary nature of surviving tablets  some scholars argue that they did tigay  for example  maintains that three major additions to the gilgamesh epic  namely the prologue  the flood story  tablet xi   and tablet xii  were added by an editor or editors  possibly by sin-leqi-unninni,  to whom the entire epic was later attributed  according to this view  the flood story in tablet xi was based on a late version of the atrahasis with most translations  especially from an ancient  dead language  scholars differ on the meaning of ambiguous sentences for example  line 57  in gilgamesh xi is usually translated  with reference to the boat   ten rods the height of her or  its walls were each 10  times 12  cubits in a rod was a dozen cubits  and a sumerian cubit was about 20  inches  hence these translations imply that the boat was about 200  feet high  which would be with the technology in gilgamesh s time  about 2700  there is no akkadian word for  height  in line 57.  the sentence literally reads  ten dozen-cubits  each i-raised  a similar example from an unrelated house building tablet reads   he shall build the wall the house  and raise it four ninda and two cubits   this measurement  about 83  feet  means wall length not 142  in gilgamesh xi is usually translated  mount niṣir held the boat  allowing no motion   niṣir is often spelled which is described as the newer the akkadian words translated  mount niṣir  are "kur-ú  kur the word kur could mean hill or country  it is capitalized because it is a sumerian the first kur is followed by a phonetic complement -ú  which indicates that kur-ú  is to be read in akkadian as šadú  hill  and not as mātu  country   since šadú  hill  could also mean mountain in akkadian  and scholars knew the biblical expression mount ararat  it has become customary to translate šadú as mountain or mount  the flood hero was sumerian  according to the wb-62  sumerian king and in sumerian the word kur meant hill or country  not mountain  the second kur lacks a phonetic complement and is therefore read in akkadian as mātu  country   hence  the entire clause reads  the hill mound country niṣir held the boat  lines 146-147  in gilgamesh xi are usually translated  i     made sacrifice  incense i placed on the peak of the similarly  i poured out a libation on the peak of the but provides this translation of line 156:   i offered incense in front of the mountain-ziggurat."  parpola provides the original akkadian for this sentence  "áš-kun  sur-qin-nu  ina ugu ziq-qur-rat  áš-kun  means i-placed;  sur-qin-nu  means offering  ina-(the  preposition  means on-(upon);  ugu means top-of;  ziq-qur-rat  means temple tower  and kur-i  means hilly  parpola s glossary  page 145)  defines ziq-qur-rat  as  temple tower  ziggurat  and refers to line 157  so he translates ziq-qur-rat  as temple tower in this context  the sentence literally reads  i placed an offering on top of a hilly ziggurat   a ziggurat was an elevated platform or temple tower where priests made offerings to the temple god  most translators of line 157  disregard ziq-qur-rat  as a redundant metaphor for peak  there is no authority for this other than previous translations of line kovacs  translation retains the word ziggurat on page 102.one  of the sumerian cities with a ziggurat was eridu located on the southern branch of the euphrates river next to a large swampy low-lying  depression known as the the only ziggurat at eridu was at the temple of the god ea  enki   known as the in gilgamesh xi  line 42  the flood hero said  i will go down river  to the apsû to live with ea  my 189–192   lines 198–201)  in gilgamesh xi are usually translated  then godenlil came aboard the boat  he took hold of my hand and brought me on board  he brought aboard my wife and made her kneel at my side  standing between us  he touched our foreheads to bless in the first sentence  then dingir-kabtu  came aboard the boat  the akkadian determinative dingir is usually translated as  god   but can also mean dingir-kabtu  literally means  divine translating this as enlil is the translator s conjecture
