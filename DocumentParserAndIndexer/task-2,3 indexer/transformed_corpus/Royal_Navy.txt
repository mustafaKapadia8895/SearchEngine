 the royal navy  rn  is the united kingdom s naval warfare force  although warships were used by the english kings from the early medieval period  the first major maritime engagements were fought in the hundred years war against the kingdom of france  the modern royal navy traces its origins to the early 16th  century  the oldest of the uk s armed services  it is known as the senior service from the middle decades of the 17th  century and through the 18th  century  the royal navy vied with the dutch navy and later with the french navy for maritime supremacy  from the mid 18th  century it was the world s most powerful navy until surpassed by the united states navy during the second world war  the royal navy played a key part in establishing the british empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th  and first part of the 20th  centuries  due to this historical prominence  it is common  even among non-britons,  to refer to it as  the royal navy  without qualification following world war i  the royal navy was significantly reduced in although at the onset of world war ii it was still the world s largest  by the end of the war  however  the united states navy had emerged as the world s largest  during the cold war  the royal navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine  force  hunting for soviet submarines  mostly active in the giuk gap  following the collapse of the soviet union  its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and remains one of the world s foremost blue-water  however  reductions in naval spending have led to the royal navy suffering from multiple problems during the 21st  century  including a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of royal navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and including an amphibious assault ship  two amphibious transport docks  four ballistic missile submarines  which maintain the uk s nuclear deterrent   six nuclear fleet submarines  six guided missile destroyers  thirteen frigates  15  mine-countermeasure  vessels and 22  patrol vessels  as of 19  march 2016,  there are 77  commissioned ships  including submarines  in the royal navy  plus 9  ships of the royal fleet auxiliary  rfa   there are also five merchant navy ships available to the rfa under a private finance initiative  the rfa replenishes royal navy warships at sea  and augments the royal navy s amphibious warfare capabilities through its three bay-class  landing ship vessels  it also works as a force multiplier for the royal navy  often doing patrols that frigates used to do  the total displacement of the royal navy is approximately 337,000  tonnes (603,000  tonnes including the royal fleet auxiliary and royal marines  the royal navy is part of her majesty s naval service  which also includes the royal marines  the professional head of the naval service is the first sea lord  an admiral and member of the defence council of the united kingdom  the defence council delegates management of the naval service to the admiralty board  chaired by the secretary of state for defence  the royal navy operates three bases in the united kingdom where commissioned ships are based  portsmouth  clyde and devonport  the last being the largest operational naval base in western europe as the seabourne branch of hm armed forces  the rn has various roles  as it stands today  the rn states its 6  major roles as detailed below as umbrella terms the strength of the fleet of the kingdom of england was an important element in the kingdom s power in the 10th  at one point aethelred ii had an especially large fleet built by a national levy of one ship for every 310  hides of land  but it is uncertain whether this was a standard or exceptional model for raising during the period of danish rule in the 11th  century  the authorities maintained a standing fleet by taxation  and this continued for a time under the restored english regime of edward the confessor  reigned 1042–1066),  who frequently commanded fleets in naval power seemingly declined as a result of the norman medieval fleets  in england as elsewhere  were almost entirely composed of merchant ships enlisted into naval service in time of war  from time to time a few  king s ships  owned by the monarch were built for specifically warlike purposes  but  unlike some european states  england did not maintain a small permanent core of warships in peacetime  england s naval organisation was haphazard and the mobilisation of fleets when war broke out was the viking era at an end  and conflict with france largely confined to the french lands of the english monarchy  england faced little threat from the sea during the 12th  and 13th  centuries  but in the 14th  century the outbreak of the hundred years war dramatically increased the french menace  early in the war french plans for an invasion of england failed when edward iii of england destroyed the french fleet in the battle of sluys in major fighting was thereafter confined to french soil and england s naval capabilities sufficed to transport armies and supplies safely to their continental destinations  however  while subsequent french invasion schemes came to nothing  england s naval forces could not prevent frequent raids on the south-coast  ports by the french and their genoese and castilian allies  such raids halted finally only with the occupation of northern france by henry vii deserves a large share of credit in fostering sea power  he embarked on a program of building merchant ships larger than heretofore  he also invested in dockyards  and commissioned the oldest surviving dry dock in 1495  at standing  navy with its own secretariat  dockyards and a permanent core of purpose-built  warships  emerged during the reign of henry under elizabeth i england became involved in a war with spain  which saw privately owned vessels combining with the queen s ships in highly profitable raids against spanish commerce and 1588,  philip ii of spain sent the spanish armada against england to end english support for dutch rebels  to stop english corsair activity and to depose the protestant elizabeth i and restore catholicism to england  the spaniards sailed from lisbon  planning to escort an invasion force from the spanish netherlands but the scheme failed due to poor planning  english harrying  blocking action by the dutch  and severe a major english expedition the following year was intended by elizabeth to destroy the survivors of the spanish fleet  but instead dissipated its efforts in unsuccessful schemes to intercept a spanish treasure convoy or foment revolt against spanish rule in portugal during the early 17th  century  england s relative naval power deteriorated  and there were increasing raids by barbary corsairs on ships and english coastal communities to capture people as slaves  which the navy had little success in charles i undertook a major programme of warship building  creating a small force of powerful ships  but his methods of fund-raising  to finance the fleet contributed to the outbreak of the english civil in the wake of this conflict and the abolition of the monarchy  the new commonwealth of england  isolated and threatened from all sides  dramatically expanded the navy  which became the most powerful in the new regime s introduction of navigation acts  providing that all merchant shipping to and from england or her colonies should be carried out by english ships  led to war with the dutch in the early stages of this first anglo-dutch  war (1652–1654),  the superiority of the large  heavily armed english ships was offset by superior dutch tactical organisation and the fighting was english tactical improvements resulted in a series of crushing victories in 1653  at portland  the gabbard and scheveningen  bringing peace on favourable this was the first war fought largely  on the english side  by purpose-built,  state-owned  warships  it was followed by a war with spain  which saw the english conquest of jamaica in 1655  and successful attacks on spanish treasure fleets in 1656  and 1657,  but also the devastation of english merchant shipping by the privateers of dunkirk  until their home port was captured by anglo-french  forces in 1658.the  english monarchy was restored in may 1660,  and charles ii assumed the throne  one of his first acts was to re-establish  the navy  but from this point on  it ceased to be the personal possession of the reigning monarch  and instead became a national institution – with the title of  the royal navy  as a result of their defeat in the first anglo-dutch  war  the dutch transformed their navy  largely abandoning the use of militarised merchantmen and establishing a fleet composed mainly of heavily armed  purpose-built  warships  as the english had done previously  consequently  the second anglo-dutch  war (1665–1667)  was a closely fought struggle between evenly matched opponents  with english victory at lowestoft (1665)  countered by dutch triumph in the epic four days battle the deadlock was broken not by combat but by the superiority of dutch public finance  as in 1667  charles ii was forced to lay up the fleet in port for lack of money to keep it at sea  while negotiating for peace  disaster followed  as the dutch fleet mounted the raid on the medway  breaking into chatham dockyard and capturing or burning many of the navy s largest ships at their in the third anglo-dutch  war (1672–1674),  charles ii allied with louis xiv of france against the dutch  but the combined anglo-french  fleet was fought to a standstill in a series of inconclusive battles  while the french invasion by land was warded the 1670s  and 1680s,  the navy succeeded in permanently ending the threat to english shipping from the barbary corsairs  inflicting defeats which induced the barbary states to conclude long-lasting  peace following the glorious revolution of 1688,  england joined the european coalition against louis xiv in the war of the grand alliance (1688–1697).  louis  recent shipbuilding programme had given france the largest navy in europe  a combined anglo-dutch  fleet was defeated at beachy head (1690),  but victory at barfleur-la  hogue (1692)  was a turning-point,  marking the end of france s brief pre-eminence  at sea and the beginning of an enduring english  later british  the course of the 17th  century  the navy completed the transition from a semi-amateur  navy royal fighting in conjunction with private vessels into a fully professional institution  its financial provisions were gradually regularised  it came to rely on dedicated warships only  and it developed a professional officer corps with a defined career structure  superseding an earlier mix of  gentlemen  (upper-class  soldiers  and  tarpaulins   professional seamen  who generally served on merchant or fishing vessels in 1707  acts of union  which created the kingdom of great britain in 1707,  established the royal navy of the newly united kingdom by the merger of the three-ship  royal scots navy with the royal navy of england  throughout the 18th  and 19th  centuries  the royal navy was the largest maritime force in the world  but until 1805  combinations of enemies repeatedly matched or exceeded its forces in despite this  it was able to maintain an almost uninterrupted ascendancy over its rivals through superiority in financing  tactics  training  organisation  social cohesion  hygiene  dockyard facilities  logistical support and  from the middle of the 18th  century  warship design and the war of the spanish succession (1702–1714),  the navy operated in conjunction with the dutch against the navies of france and spain  in support of the efforts of britain s austrian habsburg allies to seize control of spain and its mediterranean dependencies from the bourbons  amphibious operations by the anglo-dutch  fleet brought about the capture of sardinia  the balearic islands and a number of spanish mainland ports  most importantly barcelona  while most of these gains were turned over to the habsburgs  britain held on to gibraltar and menorca  which were retained in the peace settlement  providing the navy with mediterranean bases  early in the war french naval squadrons had done considerable damage to english and dutch commercial convoys  however  a major victory over france and spain at vigo bay (1702),  further successes in battle  and the scuttling of the entire french mediterranean fleet at toulon in 1707  virtually cleared the navy s opponents from the seas for the latter part of the war  naval operations also enabled the conquest of the french colonies in nova scotia and further conflict with spain followed in the war of the quadruple alliance (1718–1720),  in which the navy helped thwart a spanish attempt to regain sicily and sardinia from austria and savoy  defeating a spanish fleet at cape passaro (1718),  and in an undeclared war in the 1720s,  in which spain tried to retake gibraltar and menorca after a period of relative peace  the navy became engaged in the war of jenkins  ear (1739–1748)  against spain  which was dominated by a series of costly and mostly unsuccessful attacks on spanish ports in the caribbean  primarily a huge expedition against cartagena de indias in 1741.  these led to heavy loss of life from tropical in 1742  the kingdom of the two sicilies was driven to withdraw from the war in the space of half an hour by the threat of a bombardment of its capital naples by a small british squadron  the war became subsumed in the wider war of the austrian succession (1744–1748),  once again pitting britain against france  naval fighting in this war  which for the first time included major operations in the indian ocean  was largely inconclusive  the most significant event being the failure of an attempted french invasion of england in subsequent seven years  war (1756–1763)  saw the navy conduct amphibious campaigns leading to the conquest of french canada  of french colonies in the caribbean and west africa and of small islands off the french coast  while operations in the indian ocean contributed to the destruction of french power in a new french attempt to invade britain was thwarted by the defeat of their escort fleet in the extraordinary battle of quiberon bay in 1759,  fought in a gale on a dangerous lee shore  once again the british fleet effectively eliminated the french navy from the war  leading france to abandon major in 1762  the resumption of hostilities with spain led to the british capture of manila and of havana  along with a spanish fleet sheltering the american war of independence (1775–1783)  the royal navy readily obliterated the small continental navy of frigates fielded by the rebel colonists  but the entry of france  spain and the netherlands into the war against britain produced a combination of opposing forces which deprived the navy of its position of superiority for the first time since the 1690s,  briefly but decisively  the war saw a series of inconclusive battles in the atlantic and caribbean  in which the navy failed to achieve the decisive victories needed to secure the supply lines of british forces in north america and to cut off the colonial rebels from outside the most important operation of the war came in 1781  when  in the battle of the chesapeake  the british fleet failed to lift the french blockade of lord cornwallis s army  resulting in cornwallis s surrender at although this disaster effectively concluded the fighting in north america  hostilities continued in the indian ocean  where the french were prevented from re-establishing  a meaningful foothold in india  and in the caribbean  british victory in the caribbean in the battle of the saintes in 1782  and the relief of gibraltar later the same year symbolised the restoration of british naval ascendancy  but this came too late to prevent the independence of the thirteen eradication of scurvy from the royal navy in the 1790s  came about due to the efforts of gilbert blane  chairman of the navy s sick and hurt board  which ordered fresh lemon juice to be given to sailors on ships  other navies soon adopted this successful french revolutionary wars (1793–1801)  and napoleonic wars (1803–1814  and 1815)  saw the royal navy reach a peak of efficiency  dominating the navies of all britain s adversaries  which spent most of the war blockaded in port  the navy achieved an emphatic early victory at the glorious first of june (1794),  and gained a number of smaller victories while supporting abortive french royalist efforts to regain control of france  in the course of one such operation  the majority of the french mediterranean fleet was captured or destroyed during a short-lived  occupation of toulon in the military successes of the french revolutionary régime brought the spanish and dutch navies into the war on the french side  but the losses inflicted on the dutch at the battle of camperdown in 1797  and the surrender of their surviving fleet to a landing force at den helder in 1799  effectively eliminated the dutch navy from the the spithead and nore mutinies in 1797  incapacitated the channel and north sea fleets  leaving britain potentially exposed to invasion  but were rapidly the british mediterranean fleet under horatio nelson failed to intercept napoleon bonaparte s 1798  expedition to invade egypt  but annihilated the french fleet at the battle of the nile  leaving bonaparte s army the emergence of a baltic coalition opposed to britain led to an attack on denmark  which lost much of its fleet in the battle of copenhagen (1801)  and came to terms with these years  the navy also conducted amphibious operations that captured most of the french caribbean islands and the dutch colonies at the cape of good hope and ceylon  though successful in their outcome  the expeditions to the caribbean  conducted on a grand scale  led to devastating losses from disease  except for ceylon and trinidad  these gains were returned following the peace of amiens in 1802,  which briefly halted the menorca  which had been repeatedly lost and regained during the 18th  century  was restored to spain  its place as the navy s main base in the mediterranean being taken by the new acquisition of malta  war resumed in 1803  and napoleon attempted to assemble a large enough fleet from the french and spanish squadrons blockaded in various ports to cover an invasion of england  the navy frustrated these efforts  and following the abandonment of the invasion plan  nelson defeated the combined franco-spanish  fleet at trafalgar this victory marked the culmination of decades of developing british naval dominance  and left the navy in a position of uncontested hegemony at sea which endured until the early years of the 20th  century after trafalgar  large-scale  fighting at sea remained limited to the destruction of small  fugitive french squadrons  and amphibious operations which again captured the colonies which had been restored at amiens  along with france s indian ocean base at mauritius and parts of the dutch east indies  including java and the in 1807  french plans to seize the danish fleet led to a pre-emptive  british attack on copenhagen  resulting in the surrender of the entire danish the impressment of british and american sailors from american ships contributed to the outbreak of the war of 1812  (1812–1814)  against the united states  in which the naval fighting was largely confined to commerce raiding and single-ship  the brief renewal of war after napoleon s return to power in 1815  did not bring a resumption of naval 1815  and 1914,  the navy saw little serious action  owing to the absence of any opponent strong enough to challenge its dominance  during this period  naval warfare underwent a comprehensive transformation  brought about by steam propulsion  metal ship construction  and explosive munitions  despite having to completely replace its war fleet  the navy managed to maintain its overwhelming advantage over all potential rivals  due to british leadership in the industrial revolution  the country enjoyed unparalleled shipbuilding capacity and financial resources  which ensured that no rival could take advantage of these revolutionary changes to negate the british advantage in ship numbers in 1859,  the fleet was estimated to number about 1000  in all  including both combat and non-combat  in 1889,  parliament passed the naval defence act  which formally adopted the 'two-power  standard   which stipulated that the royal navy should maintain a number of battleships at least equal to the combined strength of the next two largest navies the first major action that the royal navy saw during this period was the bombardment of algiers in 1816  by a joint anglo-dutch  fleet under lord exmouth  to force the barbary state of algiers to free christian slaves and to halt the practice of enslaving europeans  during the greek war of independence  the combined navies of britain  france and russia defeated an ottoman fleet at the battle of navarino in 1827,  the last major action between sailing ships  during the same period  the royal navy took anti-piracy  actions in the south china between 1807  and 1865,  it maintained a blockade of africa to counter the illegal slave trade  it also participated in the crimean war of 1854–56,  as well as numerous military actions throughout asia and africa  notably the first and second opium wars with qing dynasty china  on 27  august 1896,  the royal navy took part in the anglo-zanzibar  war  which was the shortest war in history the end of the 19th  century saw structural changes brought about by the first sea lord jackie fisher  who retired  scrapped or placed into reserve many of the older vessels  making funds and manpower available for newer ships  he also oversaw the development of hms dreadnought  launched in 1906.  its speed and firepower rendered all existing battleships obsolete  the industrial and economic development of germany had by this time overtaken britain  enabling the imperial german navy to attempt to outpace british construction of dreadnoughts  in the ensuing arms race  britain succeeded in maintaining a substantial numerical advantage over germany  but for the first time since 1805  another navy now existed with the capacity to challenge the royal navy in were also gradually introduced in the conditions for enlisted men with the abolition of military flogging in 1879,  amongst the first world war  most of the royal navy s strength was mostly deployed at home in the grand fleet  confronting the german high seas fleet across the north sea  several inconclusive clashes took place between them  chiefly the battle of jutland in 1916.  the british numerical advantage proved insurmountable  leading the high seas fleet to abandon any attempt to challenge british dominance elsewhere in the world  the navy hunted down the handful of german surface raiders at large  during the dardanelles campaign against the ottoman empire in 1915,  it suffered heavy losses during a failed attempt to break through the system of minefields and shore batteries defending the straits upon entering the war  the navy had immediately established a blockade of germany  the navy s northern patrol closed off access to the north sea  while the dover patrol closed off access to the english channel  the navy also mined the north sea  as well as closing off the imperial german navy s access to the atlantic  the blockade largely blocked neutral merchant shipping heading to or from germany  the blockade was maintained during the eight months after the armistice was agreed to force germany to end the war and sign the treaty of most serious menace faced by the navy came from the attacks on merchant shipping mounted by german u-boats.  for much of the war this submarine campaign was restricted by prize rules requiring merchant ships to be warned and evacuated before sinking  in 1915,  the germans renounced these restrictions and began to sink merchant ships on sight  but later returned to the previous rules of engagement to placate neutral opinion  a resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917  raised the prospect of britain and its allies being starved into submission  the navy s response to this new form of warfare had proved inadequate due to its refusal to adopt a convoy system for merchant shipping  despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the technique in protecting troop ships  the belated introduction of convoys sharply reduced losses and brought the u-boat  threat under control in the inter-war  period  the royal navy was stripped of much of its power  the washington and london naval treaties imposed the scrapping of some capital ships and limitations on new construction  in 1932,  the invergordon mutiny took place over a proposed 25%  pay cut  which was eventually reduced to 10%.  international tensions increased in the mid-1930s  and the second london naval treaty of 1935  failed to halt the development of a naval arms race  by 1938,  treaty limits were effectively being ignored  the re-armament  of the royal navy was well under way by this point  the royal navy had begun construction of the still treaty-affected  and undergunned new battleships and its first full-sized  purpose-built  aircraft carriers  in addition to new construction  several existing old battleships  whose gun power offset to a significant extent the weakly armed new battleships   battlecruisers and heavy cruisers were reconstructed  and anti-aircraft  weaponry reinforced  while new technologies  such as asdic  huff-duff  and hydrophones  were developed  the navy had lost control of naval aviation when the royal naval air service was merged with the royal flying corps to form the royal air force in 1918,  but regained control of ship-board  aircraft with the return of the fleet air arm to naval control in 1937.  however  the effectiveness of its aircraft lagged far behind its rivals  and around this time the imperial japanese navy and the united states navy began to surpass the royal navy in air power at the start of the second world war in 1939,  the royal navy was the largest in the world  with over 1,400  vessels  the early phases of the second world war  the royal navy provided critical cover during british evacuations from dunkirk  at taranto  admiral cunningham commanded a fleet that launched the first all-aircraft  naval attack in history  later  cunningham was determined that as many allied soldiers as possible should be evacuated after their defeat on crete  when army generals feared he would lose too many ships  he famously said   it takes the navy three years to build a new ship  it will take three hundred years to build a new tradition  the evacuation will royal navy suffered heavy losses in the first two years of the war  including the carriers hms courageous  glorious and ark royal  the battleships hms royal oak and barham and the battlecruiser hms hood in the european theatre  and the carrier hms hermes  the battleship hms prince of wales  the battlecruiser hms repulse and the heavy cruisers hms exeter  dorsetshire and cornwall in the asian theatre  of the 1,418  men on the hood  only three survived its over 3,000  people were lost when the converted troopship lancastria was sunk in june 1940,  the greatest maritime disaster in britain s there were however also successes against enemy surface ships  as in the battles of the river plate in 1939,  narvik in 1940  and cape matapan in 1941,  and the sinking of the german capital ships bismarck in 1941  and scharnhorst in 1943.the  navy s most critical struggle in this war was the battle of the atlantic  the defence of britain s vital atlantic supply lines against u-boat  attack  while a convoy system was instituted from the start of the war  german submarine tactics  based on group attacks by "wolf-packs",  were much more effective than in the previous war  and the threat remained serious for well over three years  defences were strengthened by the deployment of purpose-built  escorts  of escort carriers  of long-range  patrol aircraft and of improved anti-submarine  weapons and sensors  and by the deciphering of german signals by the code-breakers  of bletchley park  the threat was at last effectively broken by devastating losses inflicted on the u-boats  in the spring of 1943.  intense convoy battles of a different sort  against combined air  surface and submarine threats  were fought off enemy-controlled  coasts in the arctic  where britain ran supply convoys through to russia  and in the mediterranean  where the struggle focused on sustaining the key british outpost of malta the navy was vital in guarding the sea lanes that enabled british forces to fight in remote parts of the world such as north africa  the mediterranean and the far east  naval supremacy was also essential to amphibious operations such as the invasions of northwest africa  sicily  italy  and normandy  by the end of the war the royal navy comprised over 4,800  ships  and was the second largest fleet in the the second world war  the decline of the british empire and the economic hardships in britain forced the reduction in the size and capability of the royal navy  all of the pre-war  ships  except for the town-class  light cruisers  were quickly retired and most sold for scrapping over the years 1945–48,  and only the best condition ships  the four surviving kg-v  class battleships  carriers  cruisers  and some destroyers  were retained and refitted for service  the increasingly powerful united states navy took on the former role of the royal navy as global naval power and police force of the sea  the combination of the threat of the soviet union  and britain s commitments throughout the world  created a new role for the navy  governments since the second world war have had to balance commitments with increasing budgetary pressures  partly due to the increasing cost of weapons systems  what historian paul kennedy called the upward spiral  these pressures have been exacerbated by bitter inter-service  rivalry  a modest new construction programme was initiated with some new carriers (majestic-  and centaur-class  light carriers  and audacious-class  large carriers being completed between 1948  through 1958),  along with three tiger-class  cruisers  completed 1959–61),  the daring-class  destroyers in the 1950s,  and finally the county-class  guided missile destroyers completed in the 1960s.hms  dreadnought  the royal navy s first nuclear submarine  was launched in the 1960s.  the navy also received its first nuclear weapons with the introduction of the first of the resolution-class  submarines armed with the polaris missile  the introduction of polaris followed the cancellation of the gam-87  skybolt missile which had been proposed for use by the air force s v bomber force  by the 1990s,  the navy became responsible for the maintenance of the uk s entire nuclear arsenal  the financial costs attached to nuclear deterrence became an increasingly significant issue for the navy the navy began plans to replace its fleet of aircraft carriers in the mid-1960s.  a plan was drawn up for three large aircraft carriers  each displacing about 60,000  tons  the plan was designated cva-01.  these carriers would be able to operate the latest aircraft coming into service and keep the royal navy s place as a major naval power  the new labour government that came to power in 1964  was determined to cut defence expenditure as a means to reduce public spending  and in the 1966  defence white paper the project was the existing carriers  all built during  or just after world war ii  were refitted  two  bulwark and albion  becoming commando carriers  and four  victorious  eagle  hermes  and ark royal  being completed or rebuilt with modern radars  angled decks  and steam catapults to operate modern jet needed   starting in 1965  with centaur  one by one these carriers were decommissioned without replacement  culminating with the 1979  retirement of ark royal  by the early 1980s,  only hermes survived and received a refit  just in time for the falklands war   to operate sea harriers  she operated along with three much smaller invincible-class  aircraft carriers  and the fleet was now centred around anti-submarine  warfare in the north atlantic as opposed to its former position with worldwide strike capability  along with the war era carriers  all of the war built cruisers and destroyers  along with the post-war  built tiger-class  cruisers and large county-class  guided missile destroyers were either retired or sold by 1984.one  of the most important operations conducted predominantly by the royal navy after the second world war was the 1982  defeat of argentina in the falkland islands war  despite losing four naval ships and other civilian and rfa ships  the royal navy fought and won a war over 8,000  miles (12,000  km  from great britain  hms conqueror is the only nuclear-powered  submarine to have engaged an enemy ship with torpedoes  sinking the cruiser ara general belgrano  the war also underlined the importance of aircraft carriers and submarines and exposed the weaknesses of the service s late 20th  century dependence on chartered merchant vessels before the falklands war  defence secretary john nott had advocated and initiated a series of cutbacks to the the falklands war though  provided a reprieve in nott-proposed  cutbacks  and proved a need for the royal navy to regain an expeditionary and littoral capability which  with its resources and structure at the time  would prove difficult  at the beginning of the 1980s,  the royal navy was a force focused on blue-water  anti-submarine  warfare  its purpose was to search for and destroy soviet submarines in the north atlantic  and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force  for a time hermes was retained  along with all three of the invincible-class  light aircraft carriers  more sea harriers were ordered  not just to replace losses  but to also increase the size of the fleet air arm  new and more capable ships were built  notably the sheffield-class  destroyers  the type 21,  type 22,  and type 23  frigates  and new lpds of the albion class  and hms ocean  but never in the numbers of the ships that they replaced  as a result  the rn surface fleet continues to reduce in size  a 2013  report found that the current rn was already too small  and that britain would have to depend on her allies if her territories were royal navy also took part in the gulf war  the kosovo conflict  the afghanistan campaign  and the 2003  iraq war  the last of which saw rn warships bombard positions in support of the al faw peninsula landings by royal marines  in august 2005,  the royal navy rescued seven russians stranded in a submarine off the kamchatka peninsula  the navy s scorpio 45  remote-controlled  mini-sub  freed the russian submarine from the fishing nets and cables that had held it for three days  the royal navy was also involved in an incident involving somali pirates in november 2008,  after the pirates tried to capture a civilian vessel the global economic recession of 2008  had a significant impact on the royal navy  all harrier aircraft were retired and put in storage  the carriers invincible and ark royal  as well as the remaining type-22  frigates were stricken and sold for scrap  illustrious however  was retained through to 2014  in the lph role  until hms ocean completed her refit  plans were
