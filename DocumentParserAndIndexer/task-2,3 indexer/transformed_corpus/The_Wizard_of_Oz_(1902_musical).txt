main plot of the show  as recounted in newspapers of the time  is pastoria s attempts to regain the throne from the wizard of oz  the original protagonists  search for the wizard puts them on the

awards dorothy with a magic ring that grants her three wishes and can summon glinda the good witch of the south at any time  the good witch then waves her wand and a pair of beautiful shoes appear on dorothy s feet  she tells dorothy that if she wants to get home  she must ask the wizard of oz to help her after a while everyone exits  and dorothy is left alone with a scarecrow hung on a pole  she wishes she had someone to talk to  and the scarecrow comes to life  he gets down from the pole and complains that he has no brain  dorothy suggests that he join her on the road to the emerald city

rushes out from the wings and sings the finale l  frank baum decided to collaborate with his friend  composer paul tietjens  and the wonderful wizard of oz illustrator w  w  denslow as set and costume designer  to bring the book to the stage  they completed a script  score and designs in 1901,  hewing fairly close to the they submitted the package to the manager of the chicago grand opera house  fred r  hamlin  who liked it and approached julian p  mitchell to be needed mitchell did not like the script  criticizing its lack of spectacle  calling it too subdued and small-scale.  however  he sent a wire to hamlin with the message  can see possibilities for extravaganza   when mitchell accepted the project  he brought in new songwriters  cutting some of the original tietjens numbers  he rewrote the script  together with glen macdonough  introducing new characters and incidents  reducing the cowardly lion s role  deleting the appearance of the wicked witch of the west entirely  and substituting a cow for toto as dorothy s companion  baum was anxious about this  but went along  he hoped mitchell s experience in directing  as well as the casting of comedy team fred stone and david c  montgomery as the scarecrow and tin woodman  would make the show a hit  it turned out to be a roaring success  with 293  needed in rewriting baum s 1901  script  mitchell hired macdonough to add topical humor  baum described macdonough as a new york joke writer in a letter to the chicago record-herald,  responding to criticism that the show  teemed with wild and woolly western puns and forced in a letter to the chicago tribune published june 26,  1904,  baum decried rumors that he was  heartbroken and ashamed  with the final product of the musical   i acknowledge that i was unwise enough to express myself as dissatisfied with the handling of my play on its first production     few authors of successful books are ever fully satisfied with the dramatization of their work  they discern great gaps in the original story that are probably never noticed by playgoers   he admitted to protesting several innovations  but ultimately concluded   the people will have what pleases them  and not what the author happens to favor  and i believe that one of the reasons why julian mitchell is regarded as a great producer is that he faithfully tries to serve the great mass of playgoers – and usually of the original songs were written by paul tietjens on baum s lyrics  except for three   the guardian of the gate   although it was attributed to tietjens   which was cut after only a few performances   the different ways of making love   wooing  and  it happens every day  were composed by nathaniel d  mann  mann later wrote the score for baum s 1908  film theatrical presentation  the fairylogue and radio-plays.  most of baum s songs related to the story in some way  as in operetta  but as performed  the play was more like vaudeville  and new songs by other songwriters were frequently substituted  in fact  the first song interpolated into the musical was  the traveler and the pie   a major number for the scarecrow  baum and tietjens had written it for a play called the octopus  or the title trust  which was never produced and possibly never completed  the song stayed in the show  james o dea and edward hutchinson wrote one of the show s most celebrated songs   sammy   in which tryxie tryfle sings of a lost love before king pastoria  though the only surviving recording of the piece was sung by a man  harry needed the witches are largely absent in this version  the good witch of the north appears  named locasta  and the wicked witch of the east is a special effect  toto  dorothy s dog  was replaced by a cow named imogene  the wicked witch of the west does not appear  and glinda the good witch of the south  who had appeared only in act three  was written out by mitchell in 1903.  his re-write  of that act was set in the borderland that divides oz and glinda s domain  as dorothy and her friends try to escape needed new characters include king pastoria ii  oz s true king working as a kansas motorman and his girlfriend  trixie tryfle  a waitress  there is also cynthia cynch  the lady lunatic  a prototype for nimmie amee  nick  niccolo  chopper s girlfriend  niccolo chopper is renowned for his ability on the piccolo  the subject of one of her songs  and he is shown playing a piccolo in the wonderful wizard of oz  the first oz film made without baum s input  which was highly influenced by the popular play  the wizard was presented as various ethnic stock character stereotypes  depending upon who played him  he was assisted by sir wiley gyle and general riskitt  david l  greene and dick martin erroneously captioned a picture of general riskitt as  sir wiley gyle  in the oz scrapbook  and donald abbott carried this mistake over into his illustrations for how the wizard saved needed the animals in the play  including the cowardly lion  did not speak  based on pantomime tradition  although the lion costume was realistic  far more so than bert lahr s in the mgm film  his main purpose was a bit of comic relief and scaring off the villains on occasion  his quest for courage is completely omitted  much as the other characters  quests are deemphasized in favor of various comic routines  ultimately  though  their desire to seek the wizard s aid gets them caught on the wrong side of the revolution  jailed and ultimately scheduled for execution  in a deus ex machina  another tornado arrives to sweep dorothy home from the chopping needed many new plot twists are virtually pointless  in addition to a kiss of protection  dorothy gets three wishes  one of which is wasted on a triviality  the second is used to bring the scarecrow to life  and the third is used so she can learn the song sir dashemoff daily  a trouser role  has written to his girlfriend  carrie barry  this song was written by baum and tietjens  but some programs credited the song to glen macdonough and a  baldwin sloane to make their connection to the play look needed probably the biggest influence on the 1939  mgm film  aside from making the story into a musical  but not using the score created for the stage version   is the field of poppies sequence that ended act i  in the novel  baum imaginatively has a legion of field mice pull a cart with the cowardly lion out of the poppy field  this was deemed unfeasible  though the stage version of the wiz created a variation  with the mice as anthropomorphic vice cops   and baum  though he included it in the 1901  script  replaced the scene with that of the snow queen creating a storm that destroys the poppies  much as glinda does in the 1939  needed  this concluded act i with an elaborate dance known as  winter jubilation   which james patrick doyle plays on synthesizers on the album  before the rainbow  the original music of oz because there were no cast albums in those days  theatre productions  including this production  often exceeded four hours in length because of multiple demands for encores  since many of the attendees knew they would never get to attend again  the most popular songs were often sung multiple times and this was often used to gauge whether a song should be retained or dropped  two popular routines that were worked in include a sailing routine and a football routine  the latter parodying the level of violence in the sport  which had recently been lessened due to new needed the original cast included anna laughlin as dorothy gale  fred stone as the scarecrow  david c  montgomery as nick chopper  the tin man   helen byron as cynthia cynch  bessie wynn as sir dashemoff daily  gilbert clayton as king pastoria ii  bobby gaylor as oz  arthur hill as the cowardly lion  grace kimball as tryxie tryffle  and edwin j  stone as imogene the cow  the second theatre to house the production was the new york theatre  it went on the road playing as far away as the opera house in hot springs national park  arkansas in 1904.  by 1905,  the new york production had been moved to the academy of music at 14th  and irving place  montgomery and stone remained in the cast  but dorothy was now played by mona marion stanley took over the role of trixie tryfle  george b  field played sir wiley gyle  and charles e  mitchell became the wizard  the snow queen was played by bert dean en travesti the musical was revived as late as 1934,  with charles h  pinkham in the role of the scarecrow the new york times  critic described the show as  the darling of mr  belasco s leone langdon-key  loved the scenery  but found baum s script commonplace  commenting that many lines start with   well  wouldn t that     and deplored tietjens s  fondness for a lack of contrast and rhythms  she also claims that the story of pastoria trying to regain the lost throne from the wizard was  as readers of the story citation needed grand duke boris vladimirovich of russia gained considerable notoriety by drinking champagne from the satin slipper of one of the chorus girls during a 1902  trip to success of the play led baum to write the marvelous land of oz after four years of demand for a sequel to the novel  he dedicated the book to montgomery and stone  and made the roles of the scarecrow and tin woodman prominent  with the roles of dorothy and the cowardly lion reduced to a reminiscence  after the team balked at leaving wizard for a sequel  baum wrote the stage musical  the woggle-bug,  eliminating the tin woodman  replacing the scarecrow with regent sir richard spud  replacing glinda with maetta from the magical monarch of mo and renaming the emerald city the  city of jewels   though oz is mentioned several times  the first appearance of the title character was moved from halfway through the novel to the opening scene  and his mentor  professor knowitall  name shortened to professor knowitt  was raised to the level of romantic lead with a girlfriend named prissy pring  a captain in general jinjur s army of revolt  jack pumpkinhead and the woggle-bug  became a comic team analogous to the scarecrow and tin woodman  the play was performed at the garrick theater in chicago and opened to reviews panning baum s script and praising the score by frederic chapin  no songs were interpolated  although two were derived from an earlier source and erroneously credited to baum   but the general consensus was that the play was a cash-in  or rip-off  of the wizard of oz rather than a sequel the musical was performed in a concert version in new york city in may 1982  by the new amsterdam theatre needed  it was revived in tarpon springs  florida by the new century opera company in 1998  and 2006,  and the company recorded the baum tietjens music on cd with piano needed  hungry tiger press published a two-cd  set of vintage recordings related to the musical in canton comic opera company  a community theatre company in canton  ohio  performed a  restored  version in 2010.  they believe that their production was the first in over 80  years with full of the music was known even beyond the united states  during the baums  1907  stay at the shepherd s hotel in cairo  egypt  a hungarian gypsy band played songs from the musical in their show toured from 1903  to 1909.  it ran on broadway from january to october 1903,  and again from march 1904  to october 1905.  it was released for stock and regional shows in 1911.
