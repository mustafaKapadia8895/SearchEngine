 joseph mallord william turner ra (23  april 1775  – 19  december 1851),  known as j  m  w  was an english romantic painter  printmaker and watercolourist  known for his expressive colourisation  imaginative landscapes and turbulent  often violent marine paintings  turner was born in maiden lane  covent garden  london  to a modest lower middle-class  family  he lived in london all his life  retaining his cockney accent and assiduously avoiding the trappings of success and fame  a child prodigy  turner studied at the royal academy of arts from 1789,  enrolling when he was 14,  and exhibited his first work there at 21.  during this period  he also served as an architectural draftsman  he earned a steady income from commissions and sales  which due to his troubled  contrary nature  were often begrudgingly accepted  he opened his own gallery in 1804  and became professor of perspective at the academy in 1807,  where he lectured until 1828,  although he was viewed as profoundly inarticulate  he traveled to europe from 1802,  typically returning with voluminous sketchbooks an intensely private  eccentric and reclusive man  he was a controversial figure throughout his career  he did not marry  but fathered two daughters  eveline (1801–1874)  and georgiana (1811–1843),  by his housekeeper sarah danby  he became more pessimistic and morose as he got older  especially after the death of his father  after which his life deteriorated  and his gallery fell into disrepair and neglect  he lived in poor health from 1845,  dying in london in 1851  aged seventy-six.  he is buried in saint paul s cathedral  london he left behind over 2,000  paintings and 19,000  drawings and sketches  he had been championed by the leading english art critic john ruskin from 1840,  and is today regarded as having elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivaling history widely considered one of the greatest masters of british watercolour landscape and marine painting  he is sometimes referred to as  the painter of a deeply experimental and progressive artist  his influence can be found in the works of painters as diverse as claude monet and mark rothko joseph mallord william turner was born on 23  april 1775  and baptised on 14  he was born in maiden lane  covent garden  in london  his father  william turner (1745–21  september 1829),  was a barber and wig his mother  mary marshall  came from a family of a younger sister  mary ann  was born in september 1778  but died in august 1785,  due to his mother showing signs of the mental disturbance for which she was admitted first to st luke s hospital for lunatics in old street in 1799  and then bethlem hospital in where she died in 1804,  the young turner was sent to stay with his maternal uncle  joseph mallord william marshall  in brentford  then a small town on the banks of the river thames west of london  the earliest known artistic exercise by turner is from this period—a series of simple colourings of engraved plates from henry boswell s picturesque view of the antiquities of england and 1786,  turner was sent to margate on the north-east  kent coast  here he produced a series of drawings of the town and surrounding area foreshadowing his later work  turner returned to margate many times in later by this time  turner s drawings were being exhibited in his father s shop window and sold for a few his father boasted to the artist thomas stothard that   my son  sir  is going to be a in 1789,  turner again stayed with his uncle who had retired to sunningwell in berkshire  now part of oxfordshire   a whole sketchbook of work from this time in berkshire survives as well as a watercolour of oxford  the use of pencil sketches on location  as the foundation for later finished paintings  formed the basis of turner s essential working style for his whole early sketches by turner were architectural studies or exercises in perspective  and it is known that  as a young man  he worked for several architects including thomas hardwick  james wyatt and joseph bonomi the by the end of 1789,  he had also begun to study under the topographical draughtsman thomas malton  specialised in london views  turner learned from him the basic tricks of the trade  copying and colouring outline prints of british castles and abbeys  he would later call malton  my real topography was a thriving industry by which a young artist could pay for his studies he entered the royal academy of art in 1789,  aged of and was accepted into the academy a year later  sir joshua reynolds  president of the royal academy  chaired the panel that admitted him  at first turner showed a keen interest in architecture  but was advised by the architect thomas hardwick to continue painting  his first watercolour painting a view of the archbishop s palace  lambeth was accepted for the royal academy summer exhibition of 1790  when turner was 15.as  a probationer in the academy  he was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures  from july 1790  to october 1793,  his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred in june 1792,  he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from nude turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout britain  particularly to wales  where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours  these particularly focused on architectural work  which utilised his skills as a in 1793,  he showed the watercolour titled the rising squall – hot wells from st vincent s rock bristol  now lost   which foreshadowed his later climatic cunningham in his obituary of turner wrote that it was   recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly 1796,  turner exhibited fishermen at sea  his first oil painting at the academy  of a nocturnal moonlit scene of the needles off the isle of wight  the image of boats in peril contrasts the cold light of the moon with the firelight glow of the fishermen s wilton said that the image   is a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the 18th  and shows strong influence by artists such as claude joseph vernet  philip james de loutherbourg  peter monamy and francis swaine  who was admired for his moonlight marine paintings  this particular painting cannot be said to show any influence of willem van de velde the younger  as not a single nocturnal scene is known by that painter  some later work  however  was created to rival or complement the manner of the dutch artist  the image was praised by contemporary critics and founded turner s reputation  as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime travelled widely in europe  starting with france and switzerland in 1802  and studying in the louvre in paris in the same year  he made many visits to venice important support for his work came from walter ramsden fawkes  of farnley hall  near otley in yorkshire  who became a close friend of the artist  turner first visited otley in 1797,  aged 22,  when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area  he was so attracted to otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career  the stormy backdrop of hannibal crossing the alps is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over the chevin in otley while he was staying at farnley hall turner was a frequent guest of george o brien wyndham  3rd  earl of egremont  at petworth house in west sussex and painted scenes that egremont funded taken from the grounds of the house and of the sussex countryside  including a view of the chichester canal  petworth house still displays a number of paintings as turner grew older  he became more eccentric  he had few close friends except for his father  who lived with him for 30  years and worked as his studio assistant  his father s death in 1829  had a profound effect on him  and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression  he never married but had a relationship with an older widow  sarah danby  he is believed to have been the father of her two daughters born in 1801  and he had a relationship with sophia caroline booth after her second husband died  living for about 18  years as  mr booth  in her house in was a habitual user of snuff  in 1838  the king of france  louis-philippe,  presented a gold snuff box to of two other snuffboxes  an agate and silver example bears turner s and another  made of wood  was collected along with his spectacles  magnifying glass and card case by an associate died of cholera at the home of his lover sophia caroline booth  in cheyne walk in chelsea  on 19  december 1851.  apparently his last words were  the sun is though this may be he is buried in st paul s cathedral  where he lies next to sir joshua reynolds his friend  the architect philip hardwick (1792–1870),  son of his tutor  thomas hardwick  was in charge of making the funeral arrangements and wrote to those who knew turner to tell them at the time of his death that   i must inform you  we have lost him   other executors were his cousin and chief mourner at the funeral  henry harpur iv  benefactor of westminster – now chelsea   westminster – hospital   revd  henry scott trimmer  george jones ra and charles turner ara turner s talent was recognised early in his life  financial independence allowed turner to innovate freely  his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint  according to david piper s the illustrated history of art  his later pictures were called  fantastic puzzles   turner was recognised as an artistic genius  influential english art critic john ruskin described him as the artist who could most  stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of his own time his work also met with criticism from more traditional contemporaries for its unique style  in particular sir george beaumont  a landscape painter and fellow member of the royal academy  who described his paintings as vehicles for turner s imagination were found in shipwrecks  fires  such as the burning of parliament in 1834,  an event which turner rushed to witness first-hand,  and which he transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches   natural catastrophes  and natural phenomena such as sunlight  storm  rain  and fog  he was fascinated by the violent power of the sea  as seen in dawn after the wreck (1840)  and the slave ship (1840).for  his painting turner drew inspiration from the art of willem van de velde the youngerone of turner s most successful  house portraits   raby

venture into printmaking was the liber studiorum  book of studies   seventy prints that he worked on from 1806  to 1819.  the liber studiorum was an expression of his intentions for landscape art  the idea was loosely based on claude lorrain s liber veritatis  book of truth   where claude had recorded his completed paintings  a series of print copies of these drawings  by then at devonshire house  had been a huge publishing success  turner s plates were meant to be widely disseminated  and categorised the genre into six types  marine  mountainous  pastoral  historical  architectural  and elevated or epic his printmaking was a major part of his output  and a museum is devoted to it  the turner museum in sarasota  florida  founded in 1974  by douglass montrose-graem  to house his collection of turner placed human beings in many of his paintings to indicate his affection for humanity on the one hand  note the frequent scenes of people drinking and merry-making  or working in the foreground   but its vulnerability and vulgarity amid the  sublime  nature of the world on the other   sublime  here means awe-inspiring,  savage grandeur  a natural world unmastered by man  evidence of the power of god – a theme that romanticist artists and poets were exploring in this period  to turner  light was the emanation of god s spirit and this was why he focused the subject matter of his later paintings by leaving out distractions such as solid objects and detail  concentrating on the play of light on water  the radiance of skies and fires  although these late paintings appear to be  impressionistic  and therefore a forerunner of the french school  turner was striving for expression of spirituality in the world  rather than responding primarily to optical needed his early works  such as tintern abbey (1795),  stayed true to the traditions of english landscape  however  in hannibal crossing the alps (1812),  an emphasis on the destructive power of nature had already come into play  his distinctive style of painting  in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints  created lightness  fluency  and ephemeral atmospheric his later years he used oils ever more transparently  and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour  a prime example of his mature style can be seen in rain  steam and speed – the great western railway  where the objects are barely recognisable  the intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed turner s work in the vanguard of english painting  but exerted an influence on art in france  the impressionists  particularly claude monet  carefully studied his techniques high levels of volcanic ash  from the eruption of mt  tambora  in the atmosphere during 1816,  the  year without a summer   led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period  and were an inspiration for some of turner s work john ruskin says in his  notes  on turner in march 1878,  that an early patron  thomas monro  the principal physician of bedlam  and also a collector and amateur artist  was a significant influence on turner s style his true master was dr monro  to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study  in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend girtin  the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed  the greatness of the power itself  it is impossible to over-estimate.together  with a number of young artists turner was able  in the london house of dr  monro  to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing  but the curious atmospherical effects and illusions of the watercolours of john robert cozens  some of which were present in monro s house  went far further than the neat renderings of topography  the solemn grandeur of his alpine views were an early revelation to the young artist and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium  conveying mood instead of information on a trip to europe  circa 1820,  he met the irish physician robert james graves  graves was travelling in a diligence in the alps when a man who looked like the mate of a ship got in  sat beside him  and soon took from his pocket a note-book  across which his hand from time to time passed with the rapidity of lightning  graves wondered if the man was insane  he looked  saw that the stranger had been noting the forms of clouds as they passed and that he was no common artist  the two travelled and sketched together for months  graves tells that turner would outline a scene  sit doing nothing for two or three days  then suddenly   perhaps on the third day  he would exclaim  there it is   and

leslie selected and shipped the 1832  atmospheric seascape staffa  fingal s worried about the painting s reception by lenox  who knew turner s work only through etchings  leslie wrote to lenox that the quality of staffa   a most poetic picture of a steam boat  would become apparent in time  on receiving the painting lenox was baffled  and  greatly disappointed  by what he called the painting s  indistinctness   when leslie was forced to relay this opinion to turner  turner said  you should tell mr lenox that indistinctness is my forte   staffa  fingal s cave is now owned by the yale center for british art turner used or experimented with a wide variety of pigments  using several within a few years of their dates of turner used pigments like carmine in his paintings  despite knowing that they were not long-lasting,  and against the advice of contemporary experts to use more durable pigments  as a result  many of his colours have now faded  john ruskin complained at how quickly turner s work decayed  turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly by 1930  there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were left a small fortune which he hoped would be used to support what he called  decayed artists   he planned and designed an almshouse for them at twickenham with a gallery for some of his works  his will was contested and in 1856,  after a court battle  his first cousins  including thomas price turner  received part of his another portion went to the royal academy of arts  which occasionally awards students the turner medal  his collection of finished paintings was bequeathed to the british nation  and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them  this did not happen because of a failure to agree on a site  and the parsimony of british governments  twenty-two  years after his death  the british parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside london  and so began the process of scattering the pictures which turner had wanted to be kept together in 1910,  the main part of the turner bequest  which includes unfinished paintings and drawings  was rehoused in the duveen turner wing at the national gallery of british art  now tate britain   in 1987,  a new wing at the tate  the clore gallery  was opened to house the turner bequest  though some of the most important paintings remain in the national gallery in contravention of turner s condition that they be kept and shown together  increasingly paintings are lent abroad  ignoring turner s provision that

referred to by his initials  in order to avoid confusion with another artist named william turner b    turner is believed to have been born some time between late april and early may 1775;  his exact date of birth is unknown  the date of 23  april  which is both saint george s day and the supposed birthday of william shakespeare  was the date turner himself claimed to have been born  but this claim has never been the first verifiable date is that turner was baptised on 14  may  this casts some doubt on 23  april date  as high infant mortality rates meant parents would usually baptise their children shortly after mary marshall died in 1804,  after having been committed in 1799  to st luke s hospital and then to the bethlem royal hospital  a mental asylum  her illness possibly due in part to the early death of turner s younger sister  hamilton suggests that this  fit of illness  may have been an early sign of her madness
