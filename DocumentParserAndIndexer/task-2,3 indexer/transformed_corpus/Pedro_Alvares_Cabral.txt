 pedro álvares  european portuguese  ˈaɫvɐr ɨ ʃ kɐˈβɾaɫ  or brazilian portuguese  ˈawvaɾis kaˈbɾaw   c  1467  or 1468  – c  1520)  was a portuguese nobleman  military commander  navigator and explorer regarded as the discoverer of brazil  cabral conducted the first substantial exploration of the northeast coast of south america and claimed it for portugal  while details of cabral s early life are unclear  it is known that he came from a minor noble family and received a good education  he was appointed to head an expedition to india in 1500,  following vasco da gama s newly opened route around africa  the object of the undertaking was to return with valuable spices and to establish trade relations in india—bypassing the monopoly on the spice trade then in the hands of arab  turkish and italian merchants  although the previous expedition of vasco da gama to india  on its sea route  recorded signs of land west of the southern atlantic ocean  in 1497),  cabral is regarded as the first captain who ever touched four continents  leading the first expedition that united europe  africa  america  and fleet of 13  ships sailed far into the western atlantic ocean  perhaps intentionally  where he made landfall on what he initially assumed to be a large island  as the new land was within the portuguese sphere according to the treaty of tordesillas  cabral claimed it for the portuguese crown  he explored the coast  realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent  and dispatched a ship to notify king manuel i of the new territory  the continent was south america  and the land he had claimed for portugal later came to be known as brazil  the fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to india a storm in the southern atlantic caused the loss of several ships  and the six remaining ships eventually rendezvoused in the mozambique channel before proceeding to calicut in india  cabral was originally successful in negotiating trading rights  but arab merchants saw portugal s venture as a threat to their monopoly and stirred up an attack by both muslims and hindus on the portuguese entrepôt  the portuguese sustained many casualties and their facilities were destroyed  cabral took vengeance by looting and burning the arab fleet and then bombarded the city in retaliation for its ruler having failed to explain the unexpected attack  from calicut the expedition sailed to the kingdom of cochin  another indian city-state,  where cabral befriended its ruler and loaded his ships with coveted spices before returning to europe  despite the loss of human lives and ships  cabral s voyage was deemed a success upon his return to portugal  the extraordinary profits resulting from the sale of the spices bolstered the portuguese crown s finances and helped lay the foundation of a portuguese empire that would stretch from the americas to the far was later passed over  possibly as a result of a quarrel with manuel i  when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in india  having lost favor with the king  he retired to a private life of which few records survive  his accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300  years  decades after brazil s independence from portugal in the 19th  century  cabral s reputation began to be rehabilitated by emperor pedro ii of brazil  historians have long argued whether cabral was brazil s discoverer  and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional  the first question has been settled by the observation that the few  cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become brazil  the sole portuguese-speaking  nation in the americas  on the second question  no definite consensus has been formed  and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof  nevertheless  although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers  cabral today is regarded as a major figure of the age of discovery little is certain regarding pedro álvares cabral s life before  or following  his voyage which led to the discovery of brazil  he was born in 1467  or 1468—the  former year being the most belmonte  about 30  kilometres (19  mi  from present-day  covilhã in central he was a son of fernão álvares cabral and isabel gouveia—one of five boys and six girls in the cabral was christened pedro álvares de gouveia and only later  supposedly upon his elder brother s death in did he begin using his father s the coat of arms of his family was drawn with two purple goats on a field of silver  purple represented fidelity  and the goats were derived from the family name  cabral pertains to goats in however  only his elder brother was entitled to make use of the family lore said that the cabrais were descendants of caranus  the legendary first king of macedonia  caranus was  in turn  a supposed 7th-generation  scion of the demigod myths aside  the historian james mcclymont believes that another family tale might hold clues to the true origin of cabral s family  according to that tradition  the cabrais derive from a castilian clan named the cabreiras  cabra is spanish for goat  who bore a similar coat of the cabral family rose to prominence during the 14th  century  álvaro gil cabral  cabral s great-great-grandfather  and a frontier military commander  was one of the few portuguese nobles to remain loyal to dom joão i  king of portugal during the war against the king of castile  as a reward  joão i presented álvaro gil with the hereditary fiefdom of as a member of the lower cabral was sent to the court of king dom afonso v in 1479  at around age 12.  he received an education in the humanities and learned to bear arms and he would have been roughly age 17  on 30  june 1484  when he was named moço fidalgo  young nobleman  a minor title then commonly granted to young nobles  by king dom joão records of his deeds prior to 1500  are extremely fragmentary  but cabral may have campaigned in north africa  as had his ancestors and as was commonly done by other young nobles of his king dom manuel i  who had acceded to the throne two years previously  awarded him an annual allowance worth 30,000  reais on 12  april he was concurrently given the title fidalgo  nobleman  in the king s council and was named a knight of the order of there is no contemporary image or detailed physical description of cabral  it is known that he had a strong and matched his father s height of 1.90  meters (6  ft 2.8  cabral s character has been described as well-learned,  generous  tolerant with but also and too concerned with the respect he felt his honor and position 15  february 1500,  cabral was appointed capitão-mor   literally major-captain,  or commander-in-chief)  of a fleet sailing for it was then the custom for the portuguese crown to appoint nobles to naval and military commands  regardless of experience or professional this was the case for the captains of the ships under cabral s command—most were nobles like the practice had obvious pitfalls  since authority could as easily be given to highly incompetent and unfit people as it could fall to talented leaders such as afonso de albuquerque or dom joão de details have survived regarding the criteria used by the portuguese government in its selection of cabral as head of the india expedition  in the royal decree naming him commander-in-chief,  the only reasons given are  merits and services   nothing more is known about these historian william greenlee argued that king manuel i  had undoubtedly known him well at court   that  along with the  standing of the cabral family  their unquestioned loyalty to the crown  the personal appearance of cabral  and the ability which he had shown at court and in the council were important also in his favor may have been the influence of two of his brothers who sat on the king s given the political intrigue present at court  cabral may have been part of a faction that furthered his the historian malyn newitt subscribes to some sort of ulterior maneuvering and has said that the choice of cabral  was a deliberate attempt to balance the interests of rival factions of noble families  for he appears to have no other quality to recommend him and no known experience in commanding major became the military chief  while far more experienced navigators were seconded to the expedition to aid him in naval the most important of these were bartolomeu dias  diogo dias and nicolau they would  along with the other captains  command 13  and 1,500  of this contingent  700  were soldiers  although most were simple commoners who had no training or previous experience in fleet had two divisions  the first division was composed of nine naus  carracks  and two round caravels  and was headed to calicut  today more often known as kozhikode  in india with the goal of establishing trade relations and a factory  trading post   the second division  consisting of one nau and one round caravel  set sail for the port of sofala in what is today in exchange for leading the fleet  cabral was entitled to 10,000  cruzados  an old portuguese currency equivalent to approximately 35  kg of gold  and the right to purchase 30  tonnes (33  short tons  30  long tons  of pepper at his own expense for transport back to europe  the pepper could then be resold  tax-free,  to the portuguese he was also allowed to import 10  boxes of any other kind of spice  although the voyage was extremely hazardous  cabral had the prospect of becoming a very rich man if he returned safely to portugal with the cargo  spices were then rare in europe and keenly earlier fleet had been the first to reach india by circumnavigating africa  that expedition had been led by vasco da gama and returned to portugal in for decades portugal had been searching for an alternate route to the east  in order to bypass the mediterranean sea which was under the control of the italian maritime republics and the ottoman empire  portugal s expansionism would lead first to a route to india  and later to worldwide colonization  a desire to spread catholic christianity to pagan lands was another factor motivating exploration  there also was a long tradition of pushing back muslims  which stemmed from portugal s fight for nationhood against the moors  the fight expanded first to north africa and eventually to the indian subcontinent  an additional ambition which galvanized the explorers was the search for the mythical prester john—a powerful christian king with whom an alliance against islam could be forged  finally  the portuguese crown sought a share in the lucrative west african trade in slaves and gold  and india s spice fleet under the command of the 32–33-year-old  cabral departed from lisbon on 9  march 1500  at noon  the previous day it had been given a public send-off  which included a mass and celebrations attended by the king  his court and a huge on the morning of 14  march  the flotilla passed gran canaria  in the canary it sailed onward to cape verde  a portuguese colony situated on the west african coast  which was reached on 22  the next day  a nau commanded by vasco de ataíde with 150  men disappeared without a the fleet crossed the equator on 9  april  and sailed westward as far as possible from the african continent in what was known as the volta do mar  literally  turn of the sea   navigational seaweed was sighted on 21  april  which led the sailors to believe that they were nearing the coast  they were proven correct the next afternoon  wednesday 22  april 1500,  when the fleet anchored near what cabral christened the monte pascoal   easter mount   it being the week of easter   the spot is on the northeast coast of present-day  portuguese detected inhabitants on the shore  and all ships  captains gathered aboard cabral s lead ship on 23  cabral ordered nicolau coelho  a captain who had experience from vasco da gama s voyage to india  to go ashore and make contact  he set foot on land and exchanged gifts with the indigenous after coelho returned  cabral took the fleet north  where after traveling 65  kilometres (40  mi  along the coast  it anchored on 24  april in what the commander-in-chief  named porto seguro  safe the place was a natural harbor  and afonso lopes  pilot of the lead ship  brought two natives aboard to confer with in the first contact  the meeting was friendly and cabral presented the locals with the inhabitants were stone age hunter-gatherers,  to whom the europeans assigned the generic label  indians   the men collected food by stalking game  fishing and foraging  while the women engaged in small-scale  farming  they were divided into countless rival tribes  the tribe which cabral met was the some of these groups were nomadic and others sedentary—having a knowledge of fire but not metalworking  a few tribes engaged in on 26  april  as more and more curious and friendly natives appeared  cabral ordered his men to build an altar inland where a christian mass was held—the first celebrated on the soil of what would later become brazil  he  along with the ships  crews  following days were spent stockpiling water  food  wood and other provisions  the portuguese also built a massive—perhaps 7  metres (23  ft  long—wooden cross  cabral ascertained that the new land lay east of the demarcation line between portugal and spain that had been specified in the treaty of tordesillas  the territory was thus within the sphere allotted to portugal  to solemnize portugal s claim to the land  the wooden cross was erected and a second religious service held on 1  in honor of the cross  cabral named the newly discovered land ilha de vera cruz  island of the true the next day a supply ship under the command of either gaspar de or andré  the sources conflict on who was returned to portugal to apprise the king of the discovery the fleet resumed its voyage on either or may 1500  and sailed along the east coast of south america  cabral became convinced that he had found an entire continent  rather than an around 5  may  the fleet veered eastwards towards on or may they encountered a storm in the south atlantic s high-pressure  zone  resulting in the loss of four ships  the exact location of the disaster is unknown—speculations range from near the cape of good hope at the southern tip of the african to  within sight of the south american three naus and a caravel commanded by bartolomeu dias—the first european to reach the cape of good hope in 1488—foundered,  and 380  men were remaining vessels  hindered by rough weather and damaged rigging  were separated  one ship that had been separated  commanded by diogo dias  wandered onward and the other six ships were able to regroup  they gathered into two formations consisting of three ships each  and cabral s group sailed east  past the cape of good hope  fixing their position and sighting land  they turned north and landed somewhere in the primeiras and segundas archipelago  off east africa and north of the main fleet remained near sofala ten days undergoing the expedition then went north  and on 26  may reached kilwa kisiwani  where cabral made an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a treaty with its kilwa kisiwani  the fleet departed to malindi  which was reached on 2  august  cabral met with its king  with whom he established friendly relations and exchanged gifts  pilots were recruited at malindi for the last leg to india and the fleet set sail  land was reached at anjadip  an island frequented by ships to obtain supplies on their way to calicut  here the ships were beached  recaulked and painted  final arrangements were put into place for the encounter with the ruler of fleet departed anjadip and arrived in calicut on 13  cabral successfully negotiated with the zamorin  the title of the ruler of calicut  and obtained permission to establish a factory and a in hopes of further improving relations  cabral dispatched his men on several military missions at the zamorin s however  on or december  the factory suffered a surprise attack by some  according to other accounts  perhaps as many as several muslim arabs and hindu indians  despite a desperate defense by crossbowmen  more than 50  portuguese were the remaining defenders retreated to the ships  some by swimming  thinking that the attack was the result of unauthorized incitement by jealous arab merchants  cabral waited 24  hours for an explanation from the ruler of calicut  but no apology was portuguese were outraged by the attack on the factory and the death of their comrades and seized 10  arab merchant ships at anchor in the harbor  around 600  of their were killed and the cargoes confiscated before the merchantmen were set cabral also ordered his ships to bombard calicut for an entire day in reprisal for the violation of the the massacre was blamed in part on portuguese animosity towards muslims  which had developed over centuries of conflict with the moors on the iberian peninsula and in north moreover  the portuguese were determined to dominate the spice trade and had no intention of allowing competition to flourish  the arabs also had no desire to allow the portuguese to break their monopoly on access to spices  the portuguese had started out by insisting on being given preferential treatment in every aspect of the trade  the letter from king manuel i brought by cabral to the ruler of calicut  which was translated by the ruler s arab interpreters  sought the exclusion of arab traders  the muslim merchants believed that they were about to lose both their trading opportunities and and attempted to sway the hindu ruler against the portuguese  the portuguese and arabs were extremely suspicious of each other s every william greenlee has argued that the portuguese realized that  they were few in numbers and that those who would come to india in the future fleets would always be at numerical disavantage  so that this treachery must be punished in a manner so decisive that the portuguese would be feared and respected in the future  it was their superior artillery which would enable them to accomplish this end   thus  they created a precedent for european behavior in asia during the following in reports from vasco da gama s voyage to india had prompted king manuel i to brief cabral regarding another port to the south of calicut where he could also trade  this city was kochi and the fleet set sail  reaching it on 24  kochi was nominally a vassal of calicut  as well as being dominated by other indian cities  kochi was eager to achieve independence  and the portuguese were willing to exploit indian disunity—as the british would three hundred years later  this tactic eventually ensured portuguese hegemony over the cabral forged an alliance with kochi s ruler  as well with rulers of other indian cities  and was able to establish a factory  at last  loaded with precious spices  the fleet went to kannur for further trade before setting out on its return voyage to portugal on 16  january expedition headed for the east coast of africa  one of the ships became stranded on a sandbar and the vessel began to founder  as there was no space in the other ships  its cargo was lost and cabral ordered the carrack to be set on the fleet then proceeded to the island of mozambique  northeast of sofala   in order to take on provisions and make the ships ready for the rough passage around the cape of good one caravel was sent to sofala—another of the expedition s goals  a second caravel  considered the fastest ship in the fleet and captained by nicolau coelho  was sent ahead to give the king advance notice of the voyage s success  a third vessel  commanded by pedro de ataíde  became separated from the fleet after leaving 22  may  the fleet—now reduced to only two ships—rounded the cape of good they arrived in beseguiche  now dakar  located near cape verde  on 2  june  there they found not only nicolau coelho s caravel but also the nau captained by diogo dias—which had been lost for over a year following the disaster in the south atlantic  the nau had experienced several adventures of its and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and malnourished men aboard—one of whom was so weak that he died of happiness upon again seeing his another portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in beseguiche  after manuel i had been told of the discovery of what is now brazil  he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it  one of its navigators was amerigo vespucci  for whom the americas would be named   who told cabral of his exploration  confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an coelho s caravel departed first from beseguiche and arrived in portugal on 23  june cabral stayed behind  waiting for pedro de ataíde s missing ship and for the caravel that had been sent to sofala  both eventually appeared and cabral arrived in portugal on 21  july 1501,  with the other vessels coming home during the following in all  two ships returned empty  five were fully loaded and six were lost  nonetheless  the cargoes carried by the fleet returned up to 800%  profit to the portuguese once sold  the proceeds covered the outlay in equipping the fleet  covered the cost of the vessels which had been lost  and cleared a profit which itself exceeded the total sum of those  undeterred by the unprecedented losses which he had sustained   asserts historian james mcclymont  when cabral  reached the east african coast  pressed forward to the accomplishment of the task which had been assigned to him and was able to inspire the surviving officers and men with like  few voyages to brazil and india were so well executed as cabral s   affirmed historian bailey which laid down a path leading to the immediate commencement  of a portuguese seagoing empire from africa to the far east   and eventually to  a land empire in cabral s return  king manuel i began planning another fleet to make the journey to india and to avenge the portuguese losses in calicut  cabral was selected to command this  revenge fleet   as it was called  for eight months cabral made all but for reasons which remain uncertain  he was relieved of it had apparently been proposed to give another navigator  vicente sodré  independent command over a section of the fleet  and cabral strongly opposed whether he was or requested himself that he be relieved of the result was that when the fleet departed in march 1502,  its commander was vasco da gama—a maternal nephew of vicente sodré—and not it is known that hostility had developed between a faction supporting da gama and another supporting cabral  at some point  cabral left the court the king was greatly irritated by the feud  to such an extent that mentioning the matter in his presence could result in banishment  as it did for one of da gama s the loss of favor with manuel cabral was able to contract an advantageous marriage in to dona  lady  isabel de castro  a wealthy noblewoman and descendant of king dom fernando i of her mother was a sister of afonso de albuquerque  one of the greatest portuguese military leaders during the age of the couple had at least four children  two boys  fernão álvares cabral and antónio cabral  and two girls  catarina de castro and guiomar de there were two additional daughters named isabel and leonor according to other sources  which also say that guiomar  isabel and leonor joined religious afonso de albuquerque attempted to intercede on cabral s behalf and on 2  december 1514  asked manuel i to forgive him and allow his return to court  but to no from recurrent fever and a tremor  possibly malaria  since his cabral withdrew to santarém in 1509.  he spent his remaining years only sketchy information is available as to his activities during that time  according to a royal letter dated 17  december 1509,  cabral was party to a dispute over a transaction involving property which belonged to another letter of that same year reported that he was to receive certain privileges for an undisclosed military in 1518,  or perhaps previously  he was raised from fidalgo to knight in the king s council and was entitled to a monthly allowance of 2,437  this was in addition to the annual allowance granted to him in 1497,  and still being cabral died of unspecified causes  most probably in 1520.  he was buried in the são joão evangelista chapel of the convento da graça in first permanent portuguese settlement in the land which would become brazil was são vicente  which was established in 1532  by martim afonso de sousa  as the years passed  the portuguese would slowly expand their frontiers westward  conquering more lands from both indigenous americans and the spanish  brazil had secured most of its present-day  borders by 1750  and was regarded by portugal as the most important part of its far-flung  maritime empire  on 7  september 1822,  the heir of portuguese king dom joão vi secured the independence of brazil from portugal and  as dom pedro i  became its first discovery  and even his resting place in the land of his birth  had been almost completely forgotten during the span of nearly 300  years since his this began to change beginning in the 1840s  when emperor dom pedro ii  successor and son of pedro i  sponsored research and publications dealing with cabral s life and expedition through the brazilian historic and geographic institute  this was part of the emperor s ambitious larger plan to foster and strengthen a sense of nationalism among brazil s diverse citizenry—giving them a common identity and history as residents of a unique portuguese-speaking  empire  surrounded by hispanic-american  the initial resurgence of interest in cabral had resulted from the rediscovery  in 1839,  of his resting place by the brazilian historian francisco adolfo de varnhagen  later viscount of porto the completely neglected state in which cabral s tomb was found nearly led to a diplomatic crisis between brazil and portugal—the latter then ruled by pedro ii s eldest sister  maria 1871  the brazilian emperor—then on a trip to europe—visited cabral s gravesite and proposed an exhumation for scientific study  which was carried out in in a second exhumation during 1896,  an urn containing earth and bone fragments was allowed to be removed  although his remains still lay in portugal  the urn was eventually brought to the old cathedral of rio de janeiro in brazil on 30  december cabral has since become a national hero in in portugal  however  he has been much overshadowed by his rival vasco da historian william greenlee argued that cabral s exploration is important  not only because of its position in the history of geography but because of its influence on the history and economics of the period   though he acknowledges that few voyages have  been of greater importance to posterity   he also says that  few have been less appreciated in their nevertheless  historian james mcclymont affirmed that  cabral s position in the history of portuguese conquest and discovery is inexpungable despite the supremacy of greater or more fortunate he concluded that cabral  will always be remembered in history as the chief  if not the first discoverer of controversy that has occupied scholars for more than a century concerns whether cabral s discovery was by chance or intentional  if the latter  that would mean that the portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west  the matter was first raised by emperor pedro ii in 1854  during a session of the brazilian historic and geographic institute  when he asked if the discovery might have been the 1854  conference  the widespread presumption was that the discovery had been an accident  early works on the subject supported this view  including história do descobrimento e conquista da índia  history of the discovery and conquest of india  published in 1541)  by fernão lopes de castanheda  décadas da ásia  decades of asia  1552)  by joão de barros  crônicas do felicíssimo rei d  manuel  chronicles of the most fortunate d  manuel  1558)  by damião de góis  lendas da índia  legends of india  1561)  by gaspar história do brasil  history of brazil  1627)  by friar vicente do salvador and história da américa portuguesa  history of portuguese america  1730)  by sebastião da rocha first work to advocate the idea of intentionality was published in 1854  by joaquim noberto de sousa e silva  after pedro ii had opened the since then  several scholars have subscribed to that view  including francisco adolfo de capistrano de pedro fábio and mário historian hélio vianna affirmed that  although there are signs of the intentionality  in cabral s discovery   based mainly in the knowledge or previous suspicion of the existence of lands at the edge of the south atlantic   there are no irrefutable proofs to support this opinion is also shared by historian thomas the debate on whether it was a deliberate voyage of discovery or not is considered  irrelevant  by historian charles r  historian anthony smith concludes that the conflicting contentions will  probably never be was not the first european to stumble upon areas of present-day  brazil  not to mention other parts of south america  roman coins have been found in today s venezuela  northwest of brazil  presumably from ships that were carried away by storm in ancient norsemen reached north america and even established settlements  though these ended in failure sometime before the end of the 15th  christopher columbus  on his third voyage to the new world in 1498,  traveled along part of what would later become the case of brazil  it was once considered probable that the portuguese navigator duarte pacheco pereira had made a voyage to the brazilian coast in 1498.  this belief has since been dismissed  however  and it is now thought that he voyaged to north america there is more certain evidence that two spaniards  vicente yáñez pinzón and diego de lepe  traveled along the northern coast of brazil between january and march 1500.  pinzón went from what is today fortaleza  capital of the brazilian state of ceará  to the mouth of the amazon river  there he encountered another spanish expedition led by lepe  which would reach as far as the oyapock river in march  the reason cabral is credited with having discovered brazil  rather than the spanish explorers  is because the visits by pinzón and lepe were cursory and had no lasting impact  historians capistrano de francisco adolfo de mário and hélio concur that the spanish expeditions did not influence the development of what would become the only portuguese-speaking  nation in the americas—with a unique history  culture and society which sets it apart from the hispanic-american  societies which dominate the rest of the continent
