 the gulf menhaden  brevoortia patronus  is a small marine filter-feeding  fish belonging to the family clupeidae  the range of gulf menhaden encompasses the entirety of the gulf of mexico nearshore waters  with the exception of the extreme eastern yucatan and western evidence from morphology and dna analyses suggest that the gulf menhaden is the gulf of mexico complement to the atlantic menhaden  brevoortia tyrannus   both species support large commercial reduction with gulf menhaden supporting the second largest fishery  by weight  in the united gulf menhaden occurs throughout the gulf of mexico  but its distribution is patchy  the center of distribution of the species appears to be the northwest northcentral particularly in louisiana and texas where populations are very large and numerous  in the southern gulf of mexico the range of gulf menhaden overlaps that of the closely related finescale menhaden  brevoortia and there is evidence for resource partitioning  a process whereby closely related species occurring in close proximity results in subtle differences in ecological niches  between these in the eastern gulf  the range of gulf menhaden overlaps that of the yellowfin menhaden  brevoortia smithi   and hybridization between these species has been demonstrated using morphological and dna gulf menhaden also may have a presence on the southern atlantic coast of although this finding is based primarily upon dna evidence gulf menhaden are commonly 8  inches in length but can reach 12  inches  gulf menhaden are a dull silver with a greenish back  like their atlantic counterpart  gulf menhaden have a prominent black spot found behind the gill cover followed by a row of smaller spots menhaden are filter feeders  meaning that they collect food by filtering water through modifications of the branchial apparatus  gill or branchial arches and gill rakers   like atlantic menhaden  gulf menhaden’s diet depends on the size of their gill rakers  which change as menhaden age  larval gulf menhaden feed primary on zooplankton because the rakers are not well developed  the juveniles  which generally correspond to when they are under the age of 1,  gulf menhaden feed more on phytoplankton  as they age and their gill rakers fully developed  menhaden shift their diet to primarily consume occurs offshore in winter eggs and larvae are pelagic and are carried into estuarine nursery areas via prevailing currents  as a result  migration at this stage can be lengthy  and populations of gulf menhaden throughout the gulf of mexico are generally thought to comprise a single genetic gulf menhaden fishery is one of the largest in the united states  in 2013,  the fishery supported four of the nation’s top ten ports by volume of gulf menhaden are harvested primarily for fish meal and fish oil based products  a much smaller number of menhaden are caught for use as bait  in addition to being one of the largest fisheries in the us  the gulf menhaden fishery has also been recognized internationally for its sustainability the fishery’s sustainability has also been certified by independent organizations  friend of the sea  an international seafood sustainability certification program  has recognized both the atlantic menhaden and gulf menhaden fisheries as this is both due to the healthy status of the stock as well as the fishery’s low levels of bycatch  which it achieves with the use of purse seine menhaden are managed by an interstate compact called the gulf states marine fisheries commission  gsmfc   according to the most recent 2013  stock assessment by the gsmfc  gulf menhaden are “neither overfished nor experiencing according to the gsmfc  “the gulf menhaden fishery is probably the most closely monitored and managed fishery in the gulf of an example of the fishery’s monitoring is the gulf of mexico purse seine fishery’s participation in noaa’s southeast fisheries observer program since specifically  the menhaden advisory committee  mac  is the gsmfc subcommittee that oversees menhaden management according to the gsmfc  “menhaden do not have the capacity to reduce unwanted phytoplankton blooms that arise from manmade sources  primarily because they eat mostly zooplankton  in addition  menhaden excrete large amounts of ammonia  a nitrogenous product   contributing to an already high nitrogen in addition  the commercial menhaden fishery only targets adult menhaden  which consume zooplankton  not juvenile menhaden  which do consume phytoplankton
