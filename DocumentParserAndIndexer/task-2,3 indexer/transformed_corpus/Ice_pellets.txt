 ice pellets are a form of precipitation consisting of small  translucent balls of ice  ice pellets are smaller than which form in thunderstorms rather than in winter  and are different from graupel   soft hail   which is made of frosty white rime  and from a mixture of rain and snow which is a slushy liquid or semisolid  ice pellets often bounce when they hit the ground or other solid objects  and make a higher-pitched   tap  when striking objects like jackets  windshields  and dried leaves  compared to the dull splat of liquid raindrops  pellets generally do not freeze into a solid mass unless mixed with freezing rain  the metar code for ice pellets is pl  pe before november pellets are known to americans as sleet  the official term used by the u s  national weather however  the term sleet refers to a mixture of rain and snow in most commonwealth including because of this  environment canada never uses the term sleet  and uses the terms  ice pellets  or  wet snow  pellets form when a layer of above-freezing  air is located between 1,500  and 3,000  meters (5,000  and 10,000  ft  above the ground  with sub-freezing  air both above and below it  this causes the partial or complete melting of any snowflakes falling through the warm layer  the french term for sleet  neige fondue  literally means  melted snow  because of this   as they fall back into the sub-freezing  layer closer to the surface  they re-freeze  into ice pellets  however  if the sub-freezing  layer beneath the warm layer is too small  the precipitation will not have time to re-freeze  before hitting the surface  so it will become freezing rain  a temperature profile showing a warm layer above the ground is most likely to be found in advance of a warm front during the cold but can occasionally be found behind a passing cold front  and often with a stationary front in most parts of the world  ice pellets only occur for brief periods and do not accumulate a significant amount  however  across the eastern united states and southeastern canada  warm air flowing north from the gulf of mexico ahead of a strong synoptic-scale  storm system can overrun cold  dense air at the surface for many hundreds of miles for an extended period of time  in these areas  ice pellet accumulations of 2–5  cm (0.8–2.0  in  are not unheard of  the effects of a significant accumulation of ice pellets are not unlike an accumulation of snow  one significant difference is that for the same volume of snow  an equal volume of ice pellets is significantly heavier and thus more difficult to clear away  additionally  a volume of ice pellets takes significantly longer to melt compared to an equal volume of fresh snowfall  media related to ice pellets at wikimedia commons
