 in chemistry  polarity is a separation of electric charge leading to a molecule or its chemical groups having an electric dipole or multipole moment polar molecules must contain polar bonds due to a difference in electronegativity between the bonded atoms  a polar molecule with two or more polar bonds must have a geometry which is asymmetric in at least one direction  so that the bond dipoles do not cancel each other polar molecules interact through dipole–dipole intermolecular forces and hydrogen bonds  polarity underlies a number of physical properties including surface tension  solubility  and melting and boiling points not all atoms attract electrons with the same force  the amount of  pull  an atom exerts on its electrons is called its electronegativity  atoms with high electronegativities – such as fluorine  oxygen  and nitrogen – exert a greater pull on electrons than atoms with lower electronegativities such as alkali metals and alkaline earth metals  in a bond  this leads to unequal sharing of electrons between the atoms  as electrons will be drawn closer to the atom with the higher electronegativity because electrons have a negative charge  the unequal sharing of electrons within a bond leads to the formation of an electric dipole  a separation of positive and negative electric charge  because the amount of charge separated in such dipoles is usually smaller than a fundamental charge  they are called partial charges  denoted as δ   delta plus  and δ−  delta minus   these symbols were introduced by christopher kelk ingold and edith hilda ingold in the bond dipole moment is calculated by multiplying the amount of charge separated and the distance between the charges these dipoles within molecules can interact with dipoles in other molecules  creating dipole-dipole  intermolecular forces bonds can fall between one of two extremes – being completely nonpolar or completely polar  a completely nonpolar bond occurs when the electronegativities are identical and therefore possess a difference of zero  a completely polar bond is more correctly called an ionic bond  and occurs when the difference between electronegativities is large enough that one atom actually takes an electron from the other  the terms  polar  and  nonpolar  are usually applied to covalent bonds  that is  bonds where the polarity is not complete  to determine the polarity of a covalent bond using numerical means  the difference between the electronegativity of the atoms is used bond polarity is typically divided into three groups that are loosely based on the difference in electronegativity between the two bonded atoms  according to the pauling scale pauling based this classification scheme on the partial ionic character of a bond  which is an approximate function of the difference in electronegativity between the two bonded atoms  he estimated that a difference of 1.7  corresponds to 50%  ionic character  so that a greater difference corresponds to a bond which is predominantly a quantum-mechanical  description  pauling proposed that the wave function for a polar molecule ab is a linear combination of wave functions for covalent and ionic molecules  ψ   aψ a b    bψ a b−   the amount of covalent and ionic character depends on the values of the squared coefficients a2  and the molecules can be described as  polar covalent    nonpolar covalent   or  ionic   this is often a relative term  with one molecule simply being more polar or more nonpolar than another  however  the following properties are typical of such molecules a molecule is composed of one or more chemical bonds between molecular orbitals of different atoms  a molecule may be polar either as a result of polar bonds due to differences in electronegativity as described above  or as a result of an asymmetric arrangement of nonpolar covalent bonds and non-bonding  pairs of electrons known as a full molecular orbital a polar molecule has a net dipole as a result of the opposing charges  i e  having partial positive and partial negative charges  from polar bonds arranged asymmetrically  water (h2o)  is an example of a polar molecule since it has a slight positive charge on one side and a slight negative charge on the other  the dipoles do not cancel out resulting in a net dipole  due to the polar nature of the water molecule itself  polar molecules are generally able to dissolve in water  other examples include sugars  like sucrose   which have many polar oxygen–hydrogen  −oh  groups and are overall highly polar if the bond dipole moments of the molecule do not cancel  the molecule is polar  for example  the water molecule (h2o)  contains two polar o−h bonds in a bent  nonlinear  geometry  the bond dipole moments do not cancel  so that the molecule forms a molecular dipole with its negative pole at the oxygen and its positive pole midway between the two hydrogen atoms  in the figure each bond joins the central o atom with a negative charge  red  to an h atom with a positive charge  blue  the hydrogen fluoride  hf  molecule is polar by virtue of polar covalent bonds – in the covalent bond electrons are displaced toward the more electronegative fluorine atom  ammonia  nh3,  molecule the three n−h bonds have only a slight polarity  toward the more electronegative nitrogen atom   the molecule has two lone electrons in an orbital  that points towards the fourth apex of the approximate tetrahedron   vsepr   this orbital is not participating in covalent bonding  it is electron-rich,  which results in a powerful dipole across the whole ammonia molecule in ozone (o3)  molecules  the two o−o bonds are nonpolar  there is no electronegativity difference between atoms of the same element   however  the distribution of other electrons is uneven – since the central atom has to share electrons with two other atoms  but each of the outer atoms has to share electrons with only one other atom  the central atom is more deprived of electrons than the others  the central atom has a formal charge of +1,  while the outer atoms each have a formal charge of − 1⁄2).  since the molecule has a bent geometry  the result is a dipole across the whole ozone molecule when comparing a polar and nonpolar molecule with similar molar masses  the polar molecule in general has a higher boiling point  because the dipole–dipole interaction between polar molecules results in stronger intermolecular attractions  one common form of polar interaction is the hydrogen bond  which is also known as the h-bond.  for example  water forms h-bonds  and has a molar mass m   18  and a boiling point of +100  °c  compared to nonpolar methane with m   16  and a boiling point of –161  °c a molecule may be nonpolar either when there is an equal sharing of electrons between the two atoms of a diatomic molecule or because of the symmetrical arrangement of polar bonds in a more complex molecule  for example  boron trifluoride (bf3)  has a trigonal planar arrangement of three polar bonds at 120°.  this results in no overall dipole in the molecule not every molecule with polar bonds is a polar molecule  carbon dioxide (co2)  has two polar c o bonds  but the geometry of co2  is linear so that the two bond dipole moments cancel and there is no net molecular dipole moment  the molecule is nonpolar examples of household nonpolar compounds include fats  oil  and petrol gasoline  therefore  most nonpolar molecules are water-insoluble   hydrophobic  at room temperature  many nonpolar organic solvents  such as turpentine  are able to dissolve polar substances in the methane molecule (ch4)  the four c−h bonds are arranged tetrahedrally around the carbon atom  each bond has polarity  though not very strong   however  the bonds are arranged symmetrically so there is no overall dipole in the molecule  the diatomic oxygen molecule (o2)  does not have polarity in the covalent bond because of equal electronegativity  hence there is no polarity in the molecule large molecules that have one end with polar groups attached and another end with nonpolar groups are described as amphiphiles or amphiphilic molecules  they are good surfactants and can aid in the formation of stable emulsions  or blends  of water and fats  surfactants reduce the interfacial tension between oil and water by adsorbing at the liquid–liquid interface this amphiphilic molecule has several polar groups  hydrophilic  water-loving)  on the right side and a long nonpolar chain  lipophilic  fat-loving)  at the left side  this gives it surfactant propertiesa micelle – the lipophilic ends of the surfactant molecules dissolve in the oil  while the hydrophilic charged ends remain outside in the water phase  shielding the rest of the hydrophobic micelle  in this way  the small oil droplet becomes water-soluble.phospholipids  are effective natural surfactants that have important biological functionscross section view of the structures that can be formed by phospholipids  they can form a micelle and are a vital in forming cell membranesdetermining the point group is a useful way to predict polarity of a molecule  in general  a molecule will not possess dipole moment  if the individual bond dipole moments of the molecule cancel each other out  this is because dipole moments are euclidean vector quantities with magnitude and direction  and a two equal vectors who oppose each other will cancel out any molecule with a centre of inversion   i   or a horizontal mirror plane   σh   will not possess dipole moments  likewise  a molecule with more than one cn axis will not possess dipole moment because dipole moments cannot lie in more than one dimension  as a consequence of that constraint  all molecules with d symmetry  schönflies notation  will  therefore  not have dipole moment because  by definition  d point groups have two or multiple cn axis since c1,  cs c∞h cn and cnv point groups do not have a centre of inversion  horizontal mirror planes or multiple cn axis  molecules in one of those point groups will have dipole moment contrary to popular misconception  the electrical deflection of a stream of water from a charged object is not based on polarity  the deflection occurs because of electrically charged droplets in the stream  which the charged object induces  a stream of water can also be deflected in a uniform electrical field  which cannot exert force on polar molecules  additionally  after a stream of water is grounded  it can no longer be deflected  weak deflection is even possible for nonpolar
