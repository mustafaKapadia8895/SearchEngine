 antonio lucio vivaldi  italian  ˈluːtʃo viˈvaldi   4  march 1678  – 28  july 1741)  was an baroque composer  virtuoso violinist  teacher and cleric  born in venice  he is recognized as one of the greatest baroque composers  and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across europe  he composed many instrumental concertos  for the violin and a variety of other instruments  as well as sacred choral works and more than forty operas  his best-known  work is a series of violin concertos known as the four seasons many of his compositions were written for the female music ensemble of the ospedale della pietà  a home for abandoned children where vivaldi  who had been ordained as a catholic priest  was employed from 1703  to 1715  and from 1723  to 1740.  vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in venice  mantua and vienna  after meeting the emperor charles vi  vivaldi moved to vienna  hoping for preferment  however  the emperor died soon after vivaldi s arrival  and vivaldi himself died less than a year later in poverty antonio lucio vivaldi was born on 4  march 1678  in then the capital of the republic of venice  he was baptized immediately after his birth at his home by the midwife  which led to a belief that his life was somehow in danger  though not known for certain  the child s immediate baptism was most likely due either to his poor health or to an earthquake that shook the city that day  in the trauma of the earthquake  vivaldi s mother may have dedicated him to the vivaldi s official church baptism took place two months parents were giovanni battista vivaldi and camilla calicchio  as recorded in the register of san giovanni in vivaldi had eight siblings  iseppo santo vivaldi  iseppo gaetano vivaldi  bonaventura tomaso vivaldi  margarita gabriela vivaldi  cecilia maria vivaldi   gerolama michela vivaldi  francesco gaetano vivaldi  and zanetta anna in citation given  giovanni battista  who was a barber before becoming a professional violinist  taught antonio to play the violin and then toured venice playing the violin with his young son  antonio was probably taught at an early age  judging by the extensive musical knowledge he had acquired by the age of 24,  when he started working at the ospedale della giovanni battista was one of the founders of the sovvegno dei musicisti di santa cecilia  an association of president of the sovvegno was giovanni legrenzi  an early baroque composer and the maestro di cappella at st mark s basilica  it is possible that legrenzi gave the young antonio his first lessons in composition  the luxembourg scholar walter kolneder has discerned the influence of legrenzi s style in vivaldi s early liturgical work laetatus sum  rv anh 31),  written in 1691  at the age of thirteen  vivaldi s father may have been a composer himself  in 1689,  an opera titled la fedeltà sfortunata was composed by a giovanni battista rossi—the name under which vivaldi s father had joined the sovvegno di santa health was problematic  his symptoms  strettezza di petto   tightness of the chest    have been interpreted as a form of this did not prevent him from learning to play the violin  composing or taking part in musical although it did stop him from playing wind instruments  in 1693,  at the age of fifteen  he began studying to become a he was ordained in 1703,  aged 25,  and was soon nicknamed il prete rosso   the red  rosso is italian for  red   and would have referred to the color of his hair  a family trait  not long after his ordination  in 1704,  he was given a dispensation from celebrating mass because of his ill health  vivaldi only said mass as a priest a few times and appeared to have withdrawn from priestly duties  though he remained a priest in september 1703,  vivaldi became maestro di violino  master of violin  at an orphanage called the pio ospedale della pietà  devout hospital of mercy  in while vivaldi is most famous as a composer  he was regarded as an exceptional technical violinist as well  the german architect johann friedrich armand von uffenbach referred to vivaldi as  the famous composer and violinist  and said that  vivaldi played a solo accompaniment excellently  and at the conclusion he added a free fantasy improvised cadenza  which absolutely astounded me  for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played  or ever will play  in such a was only 25  when he started working at the ospedale della pietà  over the next thirty years he composed most of his major works while working there were four similar institutions in venice  their purpose was to give shelter and education to children who were abandoned or orphaned  or whose families could not support them  they were financed by funds provided by the the boys learned a trade and had to leave when they reached 15.  the girls received a musical education  and the most talented stayed and became members of the ospedale s renowned orchestra and choir shortly after vivaldi s appointment  the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad  too  vivaldi wrote concertos  cantatas and sacred vocal music for these sacred works  which number over 60,  are varied  they included solo motets and large-scale  choral works for soloists  double chorus  and in 1704,  the position of teacher of viola all inglese was added to his duties as violin the position of maestro di coro  which was at one time filled by vivaldi  required a lot of time and work  he had to compose an oratorio or concerto at every feast and teach the orphans both music theory and how to play certain relationship with the board of directors of the ospedale was often strained  the board had to take a vote every year on whether to keep a teacher  the vote on vivaldi was seldom unanimous  and went 7  to 6  against him in after a year as a freelance musician  he was recalled by the ospedale with a unanimous vote in 1711;  clearly during his year s absence the board had realized the importance of his he became responsible for all of the musical activity of the when he was promoted to maestro de  concerti  music director  in 1705,  the first collection  connor cassara  of his works was published by giuseppe his opus 1  is a collection of 12  sonatas for two violins and basso continuo  in a conventional in 1709,  a second collection of 12  sonatas for violin and basso continuo appeared  his opus a real breakthrough as a composer came with his first collection of 12  concerti for one  two  and four violins with strings  l estro armonico opus 3,  which was published in amsterdam in 1711  by estienne dedicated to grand prince ferdinand of tuscany  the prince sponsored many musicians including alessandro scarlatti and george frideric handel  he was a musician himself  and vivaldi probably met him in l estro armonico was a resounding success all over europe  it was followed in 1714  by la stravaganza opus 4,  a collection of concerti for solo violin and dedicated to an old violin student of vivaldi s  the venetian noble vettor february 1711,  vivaldi and his father traveled to brescia  where his setting of the stabat mater  rv 621)  was played as part of a religious festival  the work seems to have been written in haste  the string parts are simple  the music of the first three movements is repeated in the next three  and not all the text is set  nevertheless  perhaps in part because of the forced essentiality of the music  the work is one of his early masterpieces despite his frequent travels from 1718,  the pietà paid him 2  sequins to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in venice  the pietà s records show that he was paid for 140  concerti between 1723  and 1733.in  early 18th-century  venice  opera was the most popular musical entertainment  it proved most profitable for vivaldi  there were several theaters competing for the public s attention  vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline  his first opera  ottone in villa  rv 729)  was performed not in venice  but at the garzerie theater in vicenza in the following year  vivaldi became the impresario of the teatro san angelo in venice  where his opera orlando finto pazzo  rv 727)  was performed  the work was not to the public s taste  and it closed after a couple of weeks  being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous 1715,  he presented nerone fatto cesare  rv 724,  now lost   with music by seven different composers  of which he was the leader  the opera contained eleven arias  and was a success  in the late season  vivaldi planned to put on an opera composed entirely by him  arsilda  regina di ponto  rv 700),  but the state censor blocked the performance  the main character  arsilda  falls in love with another woman  lisea  who is pretending to be a vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year  and it was a resounding success at this period  the pietà commissioned several liturgical works  the most important were two oratorios  moyses deus pharaonis   rv 643)  is lost  the second  juditha triumphans  rv 644),  celebrates the victory of the republic of venice against the turks and the recapture of the island of corfu  composed in 1716,  it is one of his sacred masterpieces  all eleven singing parts were performed by girls of the pietà  both the female and male roles  many of the arias include parts for solo instruments—recorders  oboes  violas d amore  and mandolins—that showcased the range of talents of the in 1716,  vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas  l incoronazione di dario  rv 719)  and la costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi  rv 706).  the latter was so popular that it performed two years later  re-edited  and retitled artabano re dei parti  rv 701,  now lost   it was also performed in prague in 1732.  in the following years  vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over italy his progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians  like benedetto marcello  a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a pamphlet denouncing him and his operas  the pamphlet  il teatro alla moda  attacks vivaldi without mentioning him directly  the cover drawing shows a boat  the sant angelo   on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priest s hat and playing the violin  the marcello family claimed ownership of the teatro sant angelo  and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution  without success  the obscure writing under the picture mentions non-existent  places and names  aldiviva is an anagram of a  vivaldi in a letter written by vivaldi to his patron marchese bentivoglio in 1737,  he makes reference to his "94  operas   only around 50  operas by vivaldi have been discovered  and no other documentation of the remaining operas exists  although vivaldi may have exaggerated  in his dual role of composer and impresario it is plausible that he may either have written or been responsible for the production of as many as 94  operas during a career which by then had spanned almost 25  while vivaldi certainly composed many operas in his time  he never reached the prominence of other great composers like alessandro scarlatti  johann adolph hasse  leonardo leo  and baldassare galuppi  as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for any extended period of time in any major opera 1717  or 1718,  vivaldi was offered a new prestigious position as maestro di cappella of the court of prince philip of hesse-darmstadt,  governor of he moved there for three years and produced several operas  among which was tito manlio  rv 738).  in 1721,  he was in milan  where he presented the pastoral drama la silvia  rv 734,  9  arias survive   he visited milan again the following year with the oratorio l adorazione delli tre re magi al bambino gesù  rv 645,  also lost   in 1722  he moved to rome  where he introduced his operas  new style  the new pope benedict xiii invited vivaldi to play for him  in 1725,  vivaldi returned to venice  where he produced four operas in the same year during this period vivaldi wrote the four seasons  four violin concertos depicting scenes appropriate for each season  three of the concerti are of original conception  while the first   spring   borrows motifs from a sinfonia in the first act of his contemporaneous opera il giustino  the inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around mantua  they were a revolution in musical conception  in them vivaldi represented flowing creeks  singing birds  of different species  each specifically characterized   barking dogs  buzzing mosquitoes  crying shepherds  storms  drunken dancers  silent nights  hunting parties from both the hunters  and the prey s point of view  frozen landscapes  ice-skating  children  and warming winter fires  each concerto is associated with a sonnet  possibly by vivaldi  describing the scenes depicted in the music  they were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve  il cimento dell armonia e dell inventione  opus 8,  published in amsterdam by michel-charles  le cène in 1725.during  his time in mantua  vivaldi became acquainted with an aspiring young singer anna tessieri girò who was to become his student  protégée  and favorite prima anna  along with her older half-sister  paolina  became part of vivaldi s entourage and regularly accompanied him on his many travels  there was speculation about the nature of vivaldi s and giro s relationship  but no evidence to indicate anything beyond friendship and professional collaboration  although vivaldi s relationship with anna girò was questioned  he adamantly denied any romantic relationship in a letter to his patron bentivoglio dated 16  november the height of his career  vivaldi received commissions from european nobility and royalty  the serenata  cantata  gloria e imeneo  rv 687)  was commissioned in 1725  by the french ambassador to venice in celebration of the marriage of louis xv  the following year  another serenata  la sena festeggiante  rv 694),  was written for and premiered at the french embassy as well  celebrating the birth of the french royal princesses  henriette and louise élisabeth  vivaldi s opus 9,  la cetra  was dedicated to emperor charles vi  in 1728,  vivaldi met the emperor while the emperor was visiting trieste to oversee the construction of a new port  charles admired the music of the red priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years  he gave vivaldi the title of knight  a gold medal and an invitation to vienna  vivaldi gave charles a manuscript copy of la cetra  a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as opus 9.  the printing was probably delayed  forcing vivaldi to gather an improvised collection for the emperor accompanied by his father  vivaldi traveled to vienna and prague in 1730,  where his opera farnace  rv 711)  was farnace garnered six revivals some of his later operas were created in collaboration with two of italy s major writers of the time  l olimpiade and catone in utica were written by pietro metastasio  the major representative of the arcadian movement and court poet in vienna  la griselda was rewritten by the young carlo goldoni from an earlier libretto by apostolo zeno like many composers of the time  the final years of vivaldi s life found him in financial difficulties  his compositions were no longer held in such high esteem as they once were in venice  changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded  in response  vivaldi chose to sell off sizeable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance his migration to the reasons for vivaldi s departure from venice are unclear  but it seems likely that  after the success of his meeting with emperor charles vi  he wished to take up the position of a composer in the imperial court  on his way to vienna  vivaldi may have stopped in graz to see anna is also likely that vivaldi went to vienna to stage operas  especially as he took up residence near the kärntnertortheater  shortly after his arrival in vienna  charles vi died  which left the composer without any royal protection or a steady source of income  soon afterwards  vivaldi became and died during the night of 27/28  july 1741,  aged of  internal infection   in a house owned by the widow of a viennese saddlemaker  on 28  july he was buried in a simple grave in a burial ground that was owned by the public hospital fund  vivaldi s funeral took place at st  stephen s cathedral  but contrary to popular legend  the young joseph haydn had nothing to do with this burial  since no music was performed on that the cost of his funeral with a  kleingeläut  was 19  gulden 45  kreuzer which was rather expensive for the lowest class of peal of bells he was buried next to karlskirche  in an area which is now part of the site of the technical institute  the house where he lived in vienna has since been destroyed  the hotel sacher is built on part of the site  memorial plaques have been placed at both locations  as well as a vivaldi  star  in the viennese musikmeile and a monument at the rooseveltplatz only two  possibly three original portraits of vivaldi are known to survive  an engraving  an ink sketch and an oil painting  the engraving  which was the basis of several copies produced at some later time by other artists  was made in 1725  by françois morellon la cave for the first edition of il cimento dell armonia e dell inventione  and shows vivaldi holding a sheet of the ink sketch  a caricature  was done by ghezzi in 1723  and shows vivaldi s head and shoulders in profile  it exists in two versions  a first jotting kept at the vatican library  and a much lesser-known,  slightly more detailed copy recently discovered in the oil painting  which can be seen in the international museum and library of music of bologna  is anonymous  and is thought to be of vivaldi due to its strong resemblance to the la cave music was innovative  he brightened the formal and rhythmic structure of the concerto  in which he looked for harmonic contrasts and innovative melodies and themes  many of his compositions are flamboyantly  almost playfully  exuberant johann sebastian bach was deeply influenced by vivaldi s concertos and arias  recalled in his st john passion  st matthew passion  and cantatas   bach transcribed six of vivaldi s concerti for solo keyboard  three for organ  and one for four harpsichords  strings  and basso continuo  bwv 1065)  based upon the concerto for four violins  two violas  cello  and basso continuo  rv 580).during  his lifetime  vivaldi was popular in many countries  including france  but after his death the composer s popularity dwindled  after the baroque period  vivaldi s published concerti became relatively unknown and were largely ignored  even vivaldi s most famous work  the four seasons  was unknown in its original edition during the classical and romantic periods during the early 20th  century  fritz kreisler s concerto in c  in the style of vivaldi  which he passed off as an original vivaldi work  helped revive vivaldi s reputation  this spurred the french scholar marc pincherle to begin an academic study of vivaldi s oeuvre  many vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered  which were acquired by the turin national university library as a result of the generous sponsorship of turinese businessmen roberto foa and filippo giordano  in memory of their sons  this led to a renewed interest in vivaldi by  among others  mario rinaldi  alfredo casella  ezra pound  olga rudge  desmond chute  arturo toscanini  arnold schering and louis kaufman  all of whom were instrumental in the vivaldi revival of the 20th  century in 1926,  in a monastery in piedmont  researchers discovered fourteen folios of vivaldi s work that were previously thought to have been lost during the napoleonic wars  some missing volumes in the numbered set were discovered in the collections of the descendants of the grand duke durazzo  who had acquired the monastery complex in the 18th  century  the volumes contained 300  concertos  19  operas and over 100  vocal-instrumental  resurrection of vivaldi s unpublished works in the 20th  century is mostly due to the efforts of alfredo casella  who in 1939  organized the historic vivaldi week  in which the rediscovered gloria  rv 589)  and l olimpiade were revived  since world war ii  vivaldi s compositions have enjoyed wide success  historically informed performances  often on  original instruments   have increased vivaldi s fame still further recent rediscoveries of works by vivaldi include two psalm settings of nisi dominus  rv 803,  in eight movements  and dixit dominus  rv 807,  in eleven movements   these were identified in 2003  and 2005  respectively  by the australian scholar janice stockigt  the vivaldi scholar michael talbot described rv 807  as  arguably the best nonoperatic work from vivaldi s pen to come to light since       the vivaldi s lost 1730  opera argippo  rv 697)  was rediscovered in 2006  by the harpsichordist and conductor ondřej macek  whose hofmusici orchestra performed the work at prague castle on 3  may 2008,  its first performance since 1730.a  composition by vivaldi is identified by rv number  which refers to its place in the "ryom-verzeichnis"  or  répertoire des oeuvres d antonio vivaldi   a catalog created in the 20th  century by the musicologist peter ryom le quattro stagioni  the four seasons  of 1723  is his most famous work  part of il cimento dell armonia e dell inventione   the contest between harmony and invention    it depicts moods and scenes from each of the four seasons  this work has been described as an outstanding instance of pre-19th  century program wrote more than 500  other concertos  about 350  of these are for solo instrument and strings  of which 230  are for violin  the others being for bassoon  cello  oboe  flute  viola d amore  recorder  lute  or mandolin  about forty concertos are for two instruments and strings and about thirty are for three or more instruments and strings as well as about 46  operas  vivaldi composed a large body of sacred choral music  other works include sinfonias  about 90  sonatas and chamber music some sonatas for flute  published as il pastor fido  have been erroneously attributed to vivaldi  but were composed by nicolas chédeville vivaldi s works attracted cataloging efforts befitting a major composer  scholarly work intended to increase the accuracy and variety of vivaldi performances also supported new discoveries which made old catalogs incomplete  works still in circulation today may be numbered under several different systems  some earlier catalogs are mentioned here  because the simply consecutive complete edition  ce  numbers did not reflect the individual works  opus numbers  into which compositions were grouped  fanna numbers were often used in conjunction with ce numbers  combined complete edition  ce  fanna numbering was especially common in the work of italian groups driving the mid-20th  century revival of vivaldi  such as gli accademici di milano under piero santi  for example  the bassoon concerto in b♭ major   la notte  rv 501,  became ce 12,  f  viii,1despite  the awkwardness of having to overlay fanna numbers onto the complete edition number for meaningful grouping of vivaldi s oeuvre  these numbers displaced the older pincherle numbers as the (re-)discovery  of more manuscripts had rendered older catalogs obsolete this cataloging work was led by the istituto italiano antonio vivaldi  where gian francesco malipiero was both the director and the editor of the published scores  edizioni g  ricordi   his work built on that of antonio fanna  a venetian businessman and the institute s founder  and thus formed a bridge to the scholarly catalog dominant today compositions by vivaldi are identified today by rv number  the number assigned by danish musicologist peter ryom in works published mostly in the 1970s,  such as the "ryom-verzeichnis"  or  répertoire des oeuvres d antonio vivaldi   like the complete edition before it  the rv does not typically assign its single  consecutive numbers to  adjacent  works that occupy one of the composer s single opus numbers  its goal as a modern catalog is to index the manuscripts and sources that establish the existence and nature of all known works  these several numbering systems are cross-referenced  at classical net the movie vivaldi  a prince in venice  fr  was completed in 2005  as an italian-french  co-production  under the direction of jean-louis  in 2005,  abc radio
