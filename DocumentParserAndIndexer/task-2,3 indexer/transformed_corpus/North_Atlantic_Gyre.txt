 the north atlantic gyre  located in the atlantic ocean  is one of the five major oceanic gyres  it is a circular system of ocean currents that stretches across the north atlantic from near the equator almost to iceland  and from the east coast of north america to the west coasts of europe and africa the currents that compose the north atlantic gyre include the gulf stream in the west  the north atlantic current in the north  the canary current in the east  and the atlantic north equatorial current in the south  this gyre is particularly important for the central role it plays in the thermohaline circulation  bringing salty water west from the mediterranean sea and then north to form the north atlantic deep water this gyre is similar to the north pacific gyre in the way it traps man-made  marine debris in the north atlantic garbage patch  similar to the great pacific garbage patch in the north north atlantic gyre forms the sargasso sea  noted for its still waters and dense seaweed accumulations as with many oceanographic patterns  the north atlantic gyre experiences seasonal changes  stramma and siedler (1988)  determined that the gyre expands and contracts with a seasonal variance  however  the magnitude of volume transport does not seem to change significantly  during the northern hemisphere winter season  the gyre follows a more zonal pattern  that is  it expands in the east-west  direction and thins in the north-south  direction  as the seasons move from winter to summer  the gyre shifts south by a few degrees latitude  this occurs concurrently with the displacement of the northeastern part of the gyre  it has been concluded that zonal deviations within the gyre remain small while north and south of the gyre they are collected in the sargasso sea region in the western part of the north atlantic gyre has led to analytical evidence that the variability of this gyre is linked to wintertime convective mixing  according to bates (2001),  a seasonal variation of 8-10  Â°c in surface temperature occurs alongside a fluctuation in the mixed layer depth between the northern hemisphere winter and summer seasons  the depth rises from 200  meters in winter to about 10  meters in summer  nutrients remain below the euphotic zone for most of the year  resulting in low primary production  yet during winter convective mixing  nutrients penetrate the euphotic zone  causing a short-lived  phytoplankton bloom in the spring  this then lifts the mixed-layer  depth to 10  meters the changes in oceanic biology and vertical mixing between winter and summer in the north atlantic gyre seasonally alter the total amount of carbon dioxide in the seawater  interannual trends have established that carbon dioxide concentrations within this gyre are increasing at a similar rate to that occurring in the atmosphere  this discovery concurs with that made in the north pacific gyre  the north atlantic gyre also undergoes temperature changes via atmospheric wave patterns  the north atlantic oscillation  nao  is one such pattern  during its positive phase  the gyre warms  this is due to a weakening of the westerly winds  resulting in reduced wind stress and heat exchange  providing a greater period of time for the gyre water temperatures to of aerosols  marine particles  and ocean water in the north atlantic gyre from 1990-1992  have led to measurements in lead isotope ratios  these measurements exceed those associated with atmospheric pollution carried from europe by the trade winds  implying that the majority of lead contamination in the gyre in the early 1990s  was primarily caused by american emissions  the surface layers of the sargasso sea were used to estimate the lead isotopic concentrations  42-57%  of the lead isotope concentrations result from american industrial and automotive contamination  despite the reduction in the production and use of leaded gasoline in the united states  however  lead concentrations from measurements made after 1992  show a decrease in the amount of lead
