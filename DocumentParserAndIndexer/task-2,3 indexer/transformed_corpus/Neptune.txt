 neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the sun in the solar system  in the solar system  it is the fourth-largest  planet by diameter  the third-most-massive  planet  and the densest giant planet  neptune is 17  times the mass of earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin  uranus  which is 15  times the mass of earth and slightly larger than neptune orbits the sun once every 164.8  years at an average distance of 30.1  astronomical units (4.50×109  km   it is named after the roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆  a stylised version of the god neptune s trident neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the solar system found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation  unexpected changes in the orbit of uranus led alexis bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet  neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23  september by johann galle within a degree of the position predicted by urbain le verrier  its largest moon  triton  was discovered shortly thereafter  though none of the planet s remaining known 13  moons were located telescopically until the 20th  century  the planet s distance from earth gives it a very small apparent size  making it challenging to study with earth-based  telescopes  neptune was visited by voyager 2,  when it flew by the planet on 25  august the advent of the hubble space telescope and large ground-based  telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar like jupiter and saturn  neptune s atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium  along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen  but it contains a higher proportion of  ices  such as water  ammonia  and methane  however  its interior  like that of uranus  is primarily composed of ices and which is why uranus and neptune are normally considered  ice giants  to emphasise this traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet s blue contrast to the hazy  relatively featureless atmosphere of uranus  neptune s atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns  for example  at the time of the voyager 2  flyby in 1989,  the planet s southern hemisphere had a great dark spot comparable to the great red spot on jupiter  these weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the solar system  with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100  kilometres per hour (580  m s  1,300  because of its great distance from the sun  neptune s outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the solar system  with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55  k (−218  °c   temperatures at the planet s centre are approximately 5,400  k (5,100  neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system  labelled  arcs    which was discovered in 1982,  then later confirmed by voyager of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope  galileo s drawings on 28  december 1612  and 27  january 1613,  contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of neptune  on both occasions  galileo seems to have mistaken neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to jupiter in the night hence  he is not credited with neptune s discovery  at his first observation in december 1612,  neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day  this apparent backward motion is created when earth s orbit takes it past an outer planet  because neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle  the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with galileo s small in july 2009,  university of melbourne physicist david jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that galileo was at least aware that the  star  he had observed had moved relative to the fixed 1821,  alexis bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of neptune s neighbour subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables  leading bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational in 1843,  john couch adams began work on the orbit of uranus using the data he had  via cambridge observatory director james challis  he requested extra data from sir george airy  the astronomer royal  who supplied it in february 1844.  adams continued to work in 1845–46  and produced several different estimates of a new 1845–46,  urbain le verrier  independently of adams  developed his own calculations but aroused no enthusiasm in his compatriots  in june 1846,  upon seeing le verrier s first published estimate of the planet s longitude and its similarity to adams s estimate  airy persuaded challis to search for the planet  challis vainly scoured the sky throughout august and le verrier by letter urged berlin observatory astronomer johann gottfried galle to search with the observatory s refractor  heinrich d arrest  a student at the observatory  suggested to galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of le verrier s predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet  as opposed to a fixed star  on the evening of 23  september 1846,  the day galle received the letter  he discovered neptune within 1°  of where le verrier had predicted it to be  about 12°  from adams  prediction  challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice  on 4  and 12  august  but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date  star map and was distracted by his concurrent work on comet the wake of the discovery  there was much nationalistic rivalry between the french and the british over who deserved credit for the discovery  eventually  an international consensus emerged that both le verrier and adams jointly deserved credit  since 1966,  dennis rawlins has questioned the credibility of adams s claim to co-discovery,  and the issue was re-evaluated  by historians with the return in 1998  of the  neptune papers   historical documents  to the royal observatory  after reviewing the documents  they suggest that  adams does not deserve equal credit with le verrier for the discovery of neptune  that credit belongs only to the person who succeeded both in predicting the planet s place and in convincing astronomers to search for after its discovery  neptune was referred to simply as  the planet exterior to uranus  or as  le verrier s planet   the first suggestion for a name came from galle  who proposed the name janus  in england  challis put forward the name the right to name his discovery  le verrier quickly proposed the name neptune for this new planet  though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the french bureau des in october  he sought to name the planet le verrier  after himself  and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director  françois arago  this suggestion met with stiff resistance outside french almanacs quickly reintroduced the name herschel for uranus  after that planet s discoverer sir william herschel  and leverrier for the new came out in favour of the name neptune on 29  december 1846,  to the saint petersburg academy of soon  neptune became the internationally accepted name  in roman mythology  neptune was the god of the sea  identified with the greek poseidon  the demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets  all of which  except for earth  were named for deities in greek and roman languages today  even in countries that have no direct link to greco-roman  culture  use some variant of the name  neptune  for the planet  however  in chinese  japanese  and korean  the planet s name was translated as  sea king star   海王星   because neptune was the god of the in mongolian  neptune is called dalain van  далайн ван   reflecting its namesake god s role as the ruler of the sea  in modern greek the planet is called poseidon  ποσειδώνας  poseidonas   the greek counterpart of in hebrew   rahab   רהב   from a biblical sea monster mentioned in the book of psalms  was selected in a vote managed by the academy of the hebrew language in 2009  as the official name for the planet  even though the existing latin term  neptun   נפטון  is commonly in māori  the planet is called tangaroa  named after the māori god of the in nahuatl  the planet is called tlāloccītlalli  named after the rain god in thai  neptune is referred both by its westernised name dao nepjun  ดาวเนปจูน   and is also named dao ketu  ดาวเกตุ   star of ketu    after the descending lunar node ketu  केतु  who plays a role in hindu astrology from its discovery in 1846  until the subsequent discovery of pluto in 1930,  neptune was the farthest known planet  when pluto was discovered  it was considered a planet  and neptune thus became the second-farthest  known planet  except for a 20-year  period between 1979  and 1999  when pluto s elliptical orbit brought it closer than neptune to the the discovery of the kuiper belt in 1992  led many astronomers to debate whether pluto should be considered a planet or as part of the kuiper in 2006,  the international astronomical union defined the word  planet  for the first time  reclassifying pluto as a  dwarf planet  and making neptune once again the outermost known planet in the solar mass of 1.0243×1026  is intermediate between earth and the larger gas giants  it is 17  times that of earth but just 1/19th  that of its gravity at 1  bar is 11.15  m/s2,  1.14  times the surface gravity of and surpassed only by neptune s equatorial radius of 24,764  is nearly four times that of earth  neptune  like uranus  is an ice giant  a subclass of giant planet  due to their smaller size and higher concentrations of volatiles relative to jupiter and in the search for extrasolar planets  neptune has been used as a metonym  discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as just as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as  jupiters  neptune s internal structure resembles that of uranus  its atmosphere forms about 5%  to 10%  of its mass and extends perhaps 10%  to 20%  of the way towards the core  where it reaches pressures of about 10  gpa  or about 100,000  times that of earth s atmosphere  increasing concentrations of methane  ammonia and water are found in the lower regions of the mantle is equivalent to 10  to 15  earth masses and is rich in water  ammonia and as is customary in planetary science  this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot  dense fluid  this fluid  which has a high electrical conductivity  is sometimes called a water–ammonia the mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions  and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen at a depth of 7,000  km  the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like very-high-pressure  experiments at the lawrence livermore national laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may be an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid core of neptune is likely composed of iron  nickel and silicates  with an interior model giving a mass about 1.2  times that of the pressure at the centre is 7  mbar (700  gpa   about twice as high as that at the centre of earth  and the temperature may be 5,400  high altitudes  neptune s atmosphere is 80%  hydrogen and 19%  a trace amount of methane is also present  prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600  nm  in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum  as with uranus  this absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane is part of what gives neptune its blue although neptune s vivid azure differs from uranus s milder cyan  because neptune s atmospheric methane content is similar to that of uranus  some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to neptune s atmosphere is subdivided into two main regions  the lower troposphere  where temperature decreases with altitude  and the stratosphere  where temperature increases with altitude  the boundary between the two  the tropopause  lies at a pressure of 0.1  bars (10  the stratosphere then gives way to the thermosphere at a pressure lower than 10−5  to 10−4  bars (1  to 10  the thermosphere gradually transitions to the exosphere models suggest that neptune s troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude  the upper-level  clouds lie at pressures below one bar  where the temperature is suitable for methane to condense  for pressures between one and five bars (100  and 500  kpa   clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form  above a pressure of five bars  the clouds may consist of ammonia  ammonium sulfide  hydrogen sulfide and water  deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of about 50  bars (5.0  mpa   where the temperature reaches 273  k (0  °c   underneath  clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be clouds on neptune have been observed casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below  there are also high-altitude  cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitude  these circumferential bands have widths of 50–150  km and lie about 50–110  km above the cloud these altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs  the troposphere  weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere  unlike uranus  neptune s composition has a higher volume of ocean  whereas uranus has a smaller spectra suggest that its lower stratosphere is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane  such as ethane and the stratosphere is also home to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen the stratosphere of neptune is warmer than that of uranus due to the elevated concentration of reasons that remain obscure  the planet s thermosphere is at an anomalously high temperature of about 750  the planet is too far from the sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation  one candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet s magnetic field  other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere  the thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water  which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and resembles uranus in its magnetosphere  with a magnetic field strongly tilted relative to its rotational axis at 47°  and offset at least 0.55  radii  or about 13,500  km from the planet s physical centre  before voyager 2's  arrival at neptune  it was hypothesised that uranus s tilted magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation  in comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets  scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the planets  interiors  this field may be generated by convective fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of electrically conducting liquids  probably a combination of ammonia  methane and resulting in a dynamo dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of neptune is about 14  microteslas (0.14  the dipole magnetic moment of neptune is about 2.2  × 1017  t·m3  (14  μt·rn3,  where rn is the radius of neptune   neptune s magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar  components  including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength  by contrast  earth  jupiter and saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments  and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis  the large quadrupole moment of neptune may be the result of offset from the planet s centre and geometrical constraints of the field s dynamo bow shock  where the magnetosphere begins to slow the solar wind  occurs at a distance of 34.9  times the radius of the planet  the magnetopause  where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind  lies at a distance of 23–26.5  times the radius of neptune  the tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72  times the radius of neptune  and likely much weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems  with winds reaching speeds of almost 600  m s (2,200  km h  1,300  mph —nearly reaching supersonic more typically  by tracking the motion of persistent clouds  wind speeds have been shown to vary from 20  m s in the easterly direction to 325  m s at the cloud tops  the prevailing winds range in speed from 400  m s along the equator to 250  m s at the most of the winds on neptune move in a direction opposite the planet s the general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs  retrograde rotation at lower latitudes  the difference in flow direction is thought to be a  skin effect  and not due to any deeper atmospheric at 70°  s latitude  a high-speed  jet travels at a speed of 300  differs from uranus in its typical level of meteorological activity  voyager 2  observed weather phenomena on neptune during its 1989  but no comparable phenomena on uranus during its 1986  fly-by.the  abundance of methane  ethane and acetylene at neptune s equator is 10–100  times greater than at the poles  this is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the equator and subsidence near the needed in 2007,  it was discovered that the upper troposphere of neptune s south pole was about 10  k warmer than the rest of its atmosphere  which averages approximately 73  k (−200  °c   the temperature differential is enough to let methane  which elsewhere is frozen in the troposphere  escape into the stratosphere near the the relative  hot spot  is due to neptune s axial tilt  which has exposed the south pole to the sun for the last quarter of neptune s year  or roughly 40  earth years  as neptune slowly moves towards the opposite side of the sun  the south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated  causing the methane release to shift to the north of seasonal changes  the cloud bands in the southern hemisphere of neptune have been observed to increase in size and albedo  this trend was first seen in 1980  and is expected to last until about 2020.  the long orbital period of neptune results in seasons lasting forty 1989,  the great dark spot  an anti-cyclonic  storm system spanning 13,000  × 6,600  was discovered by nasa s voyager 2  spacecraft  the storm resembled the great red spot of jupiter  some five years later  on 2  november 1994,  the hubble space telescope did not see the great dark spot on the planet  instead  a new storm similar to the great dark spot was found in neptune s northern scooter is another storm  a white cloud group farther south than the great dark spot  this nickname first arose during the months leading up to the voyager 2  encounter in 1989,  when they were observed moving at speeds faster than the great dark spot  and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by voyager the small dark spot is a southern cyclonic storm  the second-most-intense  storm observed during the 1989  encounter  it was initially completely dark  but as voyager 2  approached the planet  a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution  dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks  as they are stable features that can persist for several months  they are thought to be vortex often associated with dark spots are brighter  persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause the persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature  dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown more varied weather when compared to uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating  although neptune lies over 50%  farther from the sun than uranus  and receives only 40%  its amount of the two planets  surface temperatures are roughly the upper regions of neptune s troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8  k (−221.3  °c   at a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1  bar (100  kpa   the temperature is 72.00  k (−201.15  deeper inside the layers of gas  the temperature rises steadily  as with uranus  the source of this heating is unknown  but the discrepancy is larger  uranus only radiates 1.1  times as much energy as it receives from the whereas neptune radiates about 2.61  times as much energy as it receives from the neptune is the farthest planet from the sun  yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the solar system  depending on the thermal properties of its interior  the heat left over from neptune s formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow  though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain uranus s lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two average distance between neptune and the sun is 4.50  billion km  about 30.1  astronomical units  au    and it completes an orbit on average every 164.79  years  subject to a variability of around ±0.1  years  the perihelion distance is 29.81  au  the aphelion distance is 30.33  11  july 2011,  neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in although it did not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky  because earth was in a different location in its 365.26-day  orbit  because of the motion of the sun in relation to the barycentre of the solar system  on 11  july neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the sun  if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used  the discovery longitude was reached on 12  july elliptical orbit of neptune is inclined 1.77°  compared to that of earth the axial tilt of neptune is which is similar to the tilts of earth (23°)  and mars (25°).  as a result  neptune experiences similar seasonal changes to earth  the long orbital period of neptune means that the seasons last for forty earth its sidereal rotation period  day  is roughly 16.11  because its axial tilt is comparable to earth s  the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme because neptune is not a solid body  its atmosphere undergoes differential rotation  the wide equatorial zone rotates with a period of about 18  hours  which is slower than the 16.1-hour  rotation of the planet s magnetic field  by contrast  the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12  hours  this differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the solar and it results in strong latitudinal wind orbit has a profound impact on the region directly beyond it  known as the kuiper belt  the kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds  similar to the asteroid belt but far larger  extending from neptune s orbit at 30  au out to about 55  au from the much in the same way that jupiter s gravity dominates the asteroid belt  shaping its structure  so neptune s gravity dominates the kuiper belt  over the age of the solar system  certain regions of the kuiper belt became destabilised by neptune s gravity  creating gaps in the kuiper belt s structure  the region between 40  and 42  au is an do exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for the age of the solar system  these resonances occur when neptune s orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object  such as 1:2,  or 3:4.  if  say  an object orbits the sun once for every two neptune orbits  it will only complete half an orbit by the time neptune returns to its original position  the most heavily populated resonance in the kuiper belt  with over 200  known is the 2:3  resonance  objects in this resonance complete 2  orbits for every 3  of neptune  and are known as plutinos because the largest of the known kuiper belt objects  pluto  is among although pluto crosses neptune s orbit regularly  the 2:3  resonance ensures they can never the 3:4,  3:5,  4:7  and 2:5  resonances are less has a number of known trojan objects occupying both the sun–neptune l4  and l5  lagrangian points—gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing neptune in its orbit  neptune trojans can be viewed as being in a 1:1  resonance with neptune  some neptune trojans are remarkably stable in their orbits  and are likely to have formed alongside neptune rather than being captured  the first object identified as associated with neptune s trailing l5  lagrangian point was 2008  neptune also has a temporary quasi-satellite,  (309239)  2007  the object has been a quasi-satellite  of neptune for about 12,500  years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another 12,500  formation of the ice giants  neptune and uranus  has proven difficult to model precisely  current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the solar system was too low to account for the formation of such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core accretion  and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their formation  one is that the ice giants were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive ob alternative concept is that they formed closer to the sun  where the matter density was higher  and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after the removal of the gaseous protoplanetary this hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured  due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-neptunian  the current most widely explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the nice model  which explores the effect of a migrating neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the kuiper belt neptune has 14  known triton is the largest neptunian moon  comprising more than 99.5%  of the mass in orbit around and it is the only one massive enough to be spheroidal  triton was discovered by william lassell just 17  days after the discovery of neptune itself  unlike all other large planetary moons in the solar system  triton has a retrograde orbit  indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place  it was probably once a dwarf planet in the kuiper it is close enough to neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation  and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration  it will eventually be torn apart  in about 3.6  billion years  when it reaches the roche in 1989,  triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the solar with estimated temperatures of 38  k (−235  second known satellite  by order of discovery   the irregular moon nereid  has one of the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the solar system  the eccentricity of 0.7512  gives it an apoapsis that is seven times its periapsis distance from july to september 1989,  voyager 2  discovered six moons of of these  the irregularly shaped proteus is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own although the second-most-massive  neptunian moon  it is only 0.25%  the mass of triton  neptune s innermost four moons—naiad  thalassa  despina and galatea—orbit close enough to be within neptune s rings  the next-farthest  out  larissa  was originally discovered in 1981  when it had occulted a star  this occultation had been attributed to ring arcs  but when voyager 2  observed neptune in 1989,  larissa was found to have caused it  five new irregular moons discovered between 2002  and 2003  were announced in a new moon and the smallest yet  s/2004  n 1,  was found in 2013.  because neptune was the roman god of the sea  neptune s moons have been named after lesser sea has a planetary ring system  though one much less substantial than that of saturn  the rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based  material  which most likely gives them a reddish the three main rings are the narrow adams ring  63,000  km from the centre of neptune  the le verrier ring  at 53,000  km  and the broader  fainter galle ring  at 42,000  km  a faint outward extension to the le verrier ring has been named lassell  it is bounded at its outer edge by the arago ring at 57,000  first of these planetary rings was detected in 1968  by a team led by edward in the early 1980s,  analysis of this data along with newer observations led to the hypothesis that this ring might be evidence that the rings might have gaps first arose during a stellar occultation in 1984  when the rings obscured a star on immersion but not on images from voyager 2  in 1989  settled the issue by showing several faint rings the outermost ring  adams  contains five prominent arcs now named courage  liberté  egalité 1,  egalité 2  and fraternité  courage  liberty  equality and the existence of arcs was difficult to explain because the laws of motion would predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over short timescales  astronomers now estimate that the arcs are corralled into their current form by the gravitational effects of galatea  a moon just inward from the observations announced in 2005  appeared to show that neptune s rings are much more unstable than previously thought  images taken from the w  m  keck observatory in 2002  and 2003  show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by voyager 2.  in particular  it seems that the liberté arc might disappear in as little as one an apparent magnitude between +7.7  and +8.0,  neptune is never visible to the naked and can be outshone by jupiter s galilean moons  the dwarf planet ceres and the asteroids 4  vesta  2  pallas  7  iris  3  juno  and 6  a telescope or strong binoculars will resolve neptune as a small blue disk  similar in appearance to of the distance of neptune from earth  its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2  to 2.4  the smallest of the solar system planets  its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually  most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the hubble space telescope and large ground-based  telescopes with adaptive optics the first scientifically useful observation of neptune from ground-based  telescopes using adaptive optics  was commenced in 1997  from neptune is currently entering its spring and summer season and has been shown to be heating up  with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence  combined with technological advancements  ground-based  telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it  both hubble and the adaptive-optics  telescopes on earth have made many new discoveries within the solar system since the mid-1990s,  with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet  among others  in 2004  and 2005,  five new small satellites of neptune with diameters between 38  and 61  kilometres were earth  neptune goes through apparent retrograde motion every 367  days  resulting in a looping motion against the background stars during each opposition  these loops carried it close to the 1846  discovery coordinates in april and july 2010  and again in october and november of neptune in the radio-frequency  band shows that it is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts  both sources are thought to originate from its rotating magnetic in the infrared part of the spectrum  neptune s storms appear bright against the cooler background  allowing the size and shape of these features to be readily 2  is the only spacecraft that has visited neptune  the spacecraft s closest approach to the planet occurred on 25  august 1989.  because this was the last major planet the spacecraft could visit  it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon triton  regardless of the consequences to the trajectory  similarly to what was done for voyager 1's  encounter with saturn and its moon titan  the images relayed back to earth from voyager 2  became the basis of a 1989  pbs all-night  program  neptune all the encounter  signals from the spacecraft required 246  minutes to reach earth  hence  for the most part  voyager 2's  mission relied on preloaded commands for the neptune encounter  the spacecraft performed a near-encounter  with the moon nereid before it came within 4,400  km of neptune s atmosphere on 25  august  then passed close to the planet s largest moon triton later the same spacecraft verified the existence of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted in a manner similar to the field around uranus  neptune s rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and voyager 2  also showed that neptune had a surprisingly active weather system  six new moons were discovered  and the planet was shown to have more than one flyby also provided the first accurate measurement of neptune s mass which was found to be 0.5  percent less than previously calculated  the new figure disproved the hypothesis that an undiscovered planet x acted upon the orbits of neptune and the voyager 2  flyby mission  the next step in scientific exploration of the neptunian system  is considered to be a flagship orbital such a hypothetical mission is envisioned to be possible in the late 2020s  or early however  there have been discussions to launch neptune missions sooner  in 2003,  there was a proposal in nasa s  vision missions studies  for a  neptune orbiter with probes  mission that does cassini-level  another  more recent proposal was for argo  a flyby spacecraft to be launched in 2019,  that would visit jupiter  saturn  neptune  and a kuiper belt object  the focus would be on neptune and its largest moon triton to be investigated around the proposed new horizons 2  mission  which was later scrapped  might also have done a close flyby of the neptunian system solar system → local interstellar cloud → local bubble → gould belt → orion arm → milky way → milky way subgroup →
