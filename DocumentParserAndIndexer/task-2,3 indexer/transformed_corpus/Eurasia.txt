 eurasia  jʊˈreɪʒə  is a combined continental landmass of europe and the term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents  europe and asia   located primarily in the northern and eastern hemispheres  it is bordered by the atlantic ocean to the west  the pacific ocean to the east  the arctic ocean to the north  and by africa  the mediterranean sea  and the indian ocean to the the division between europe and asia as two different continents is a historical social construct  with no clear physical separation between them  thus  in some parts of the world  eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six in geology  eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock  however  the rigidity of eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet covers around 55,000,000  square kilometres (21,000,000  sq mi   or around 36.2%  of the earth s total land area  the landmass contains around 5.0  billion people  equating to approximately 70%  of the human population  humans first settled in eurasia between 60,000  and 125,000  years ago  some major islands  including great britain  iceland  and ireland  and those of japan  the philippines and indonesia  are often included under the popular definition of eurasia  in spite of being separate from the massive landmass physiographically  eurasia is a single the concepts of europe and asia as distinct continents date back to antiquity and their borders are geologically arbitrary  in ancient times the black sea and the sea of marmara  along with their associated straits  were seen as separating the continents  but today the ural and caucasus ranges are more seen as the main delimiters between the two  eurasia is connected to africa at the suez canal  and eurasia is sometimes combined with africa to make the largest contiguous landmass on earth called due to the vast landmass and differences in latitude  eurasia exhibits all types of climate under the köppen classification  including the harshest types of hot and cold temperatures  high and low precipitation and various types of ecosystems eurasia formed 375  to 325  million years ago with the merging of siberia  kazakhstania  and baltica  which was joined to laurentia  now north america  to form euramerica  chinese cratons collided with siberia s southern coast eurasia has been the host of many ancient civilizations  including those based in mesopotamia  the indus valley and china  in the axial age (mid-first  millennium bc   a continuous belt of civilizations stretched through the eurasian subtropical zone from the atlantic to the pacific  this belt became the mainstream of world history for two millennia originally  “eurasia” is a geographical notion  in this sense  it is simply the biggest continent  the combined landmass of europe and asia  however  geopolitically  the word has several different meanings  reflecting the specific geopolitical interests of each “eurasia” is one of the most important geopolitical concepts  as zbigniew brzezinski observed “    how america  manages  eurasia is critical  a power that dominates “eurasia” would control two of the world’s three most advanced and economically productive regions  a mere glance at the map also suggests that control “eurasia” would almost automatically entail africa’s subordination  rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the world’s central continent  about 75  per cent of the world’s people live in “eurasia”  and most of the world’s physical wealth is there as well  both in its enterprises and underneath its soil  “eurasia” accounts for about three-fourths  of the world’s known energy the moment one of the most prominent projects of the european union  eu  is the russia -  eu four common spaces initiative  a political and economic union of former soviet states named the eurasian economic union was established in 2015,  similar in concept to the eu the russian concept of “eurasia” corresponded initially more or less to the land area of imperial russia in 1914,  including parts of eastern one of russia s main geopolitical interests lies in ever closer integration with those countries that it considers part of this concept is further integrated with communist eschatology by author alexander dugin as the guiding principle of "self-sufficiency  of a large space  during two years since 1996  a meeting of most asian and european countries is organised as the asia-europe  meeting  asem  in ancient times  the greeks classified europe  derived from the mythological phoenician princess europa  and asia  derived from asia  a woman in greek mythology  as separate  lands   where to draw the dividing line between the two regions is still a matter of discussion  especially whether the kuma-manych  depression or the caucasus mountains form the southeast boundary is disputed  since mount elbrus would be part of europe in the latter case  making it  and not mont blanc  europe s highest mountain  most accepted is probably the boundary as defined by philip johan von strahlenberg in the 18th  century  he defined the dividing line along the aegean sea  dardanelles  sea of marmara  bosporus  black sea  kuma–manych depression  caspian sea  ural river  and ural mountains located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres  eurasia is considered a supercontinent  part of the supercontinent of afro-eurasia  or simply a continent in its own in plate tectonics  the eurasian plate includes europe and most of asia but not the indian subcontinent  the arabian peninsula or the area of the russian far east east of the chersky range.nineteenth-century  russian philosopher nikolai danilevsky defined eurasia as an entity separate from europe and asia  bounded by the himalayas  the caucasus  the alps  the arctic  the pacific  the atlantic  the mediterranean  the black sea and the caspian sea  a definition that has been influential in russia and other parts of the former soviet nowadays  partly inspired by this usage  the term eurasia is sometimes used to refer to the post-soviet  space – in particular russia  the central asian republics  and the transcaucasian republics – and sometimes also adjacent regions such as turkey  mongolia  afghanistan and xinjiang  this usage can be seen in the names of the journal of eurasian and the association for slavic  east european  and eurasian as well as the titles of numerous academic programmes at us another prominent example of this usage is in the name of the eurasian economic community  an organization including kazakhstan  russia  and some of their neighbors  and headquartered in moscow  russia  and astana  the capital of kazakhstan the word  eurasia  is often used in kazakhstan to describe its location  numerous kazakh institutions have the term in their names  like the l  n  gumilev eurasian national university  kazakh  л  н  гумилёв атындағы еуразия ұлттық университеті  russian  евразийский национальный университет имени л  н   lev gumilev s eurasianism ideas having been popularized in kazakhstan by olzhas suleimenov   the eurasian media the eurasian cultural foundation  russian  евразийский фонд культуры   the eurasian development bank  russian  евразийский банк and the eurasian in 2007  kazakhstan s president  nursultan nazarbayev  proposed building a  eurasia canal  to connect the caspian sea and the black sea via russia s kuma-manych  depression in order to provide kazakhstan and other caspian-basin  countries with a more efficient path to the ocean than the existing volga-don  this usage is comparable to how americans use  western hemisphere  to describe concepts and organizations dealing with the americas  e g   council on hemispheric affairs  western hemisphere institute for security cooperation   africa antarctica asia australia europe north america south america afro-eurasia  america eurasia oceaniacoordinates  50°n  80°e﻿    ﻿50°n  80°e﻿    50;  80
