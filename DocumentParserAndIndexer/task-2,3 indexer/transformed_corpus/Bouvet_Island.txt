lies at the southern end of the mid-atlantic  ridge and is the most remote island in the world  approximately 2,600  kilometres (1,600  mi  south-southwest  of the coast of south africa and approximately 1,700  kilometres (1,100  mi  north of the princess astrid coast of queen maud land  antarctica the island has an area of 49  square kilometres (19  sq mi   of which 93  percent is covered by a glacier  the centre of the island is an ice-filled  crater of an inactive volcano  some skerries and one smaller island  larsøya  lie along the coast  nyrøysa  created by a rock slide in the late 1950s,  is the only easy place to land and is the location of a weather station the island was first spotted on 1  january 1739  by jean-baptiste  charles bouvet de lozier  after whom it was later named  he recorded inaccurate coordinates and the island was not sighted again until 1808,  when the british whaler captain james lindsay named it lindsay the first claim of landing  although disputed  was by benjamin morrell  in 1825,  the island was claimed for the british crown by george norris  who named it liverpool island  he also reported thompson island as nearby  although this was later shown to be a phantom island  the first norvegia expedition landed on the island in 1927  and claimed it for norway  at this time the island was named bouvet island  or  bouvetøya  in after a dispute with the united kingdom  it was declared a norwegian dependency in 1930.  it became a nature reserve in 1971.the  island was discovered on 1  january 1739  by jean-baptiste  charles bouvet de lozier  commander of the french ships aigle and bouvet  who was searching for a presumed large southern continent  spotted the island through the fog and named the cape he saw cap de la circoncision  he was not able to land and did not circumnavigate his discovery  thus not clarifying if it was an island or part of a his plotting of its position was leading several expeditions to fail to find the island james cook s second voyage set off from cape verde on 22  november 1772  to find cape circoncision  but was unable to find the next expedition to spot the island was in 1808  by james lindsay  captain of the samuel enderby   sons   se s  whaler snow they reached the island and recorded its position  though they were unable to lindsay could confirm that the  cape  was indeed an the next expedition to arrive at the island was american benjamin morrell and his seal hunting ship wasp  morrell  by his own account  found the island without difficulty  with  improbable ease   in the words of historian william before landing and hunting 196  in his subsequent lengthy description  morrell does not mention the island s most obvious physical feature  its permanent ice this has caused some commentators to doubt whether he actually visited the 10  december 1825,  se s s george norris  master of the sprightly  landed on the named it liverpool island and claimed it for the british crown and george iv on 16  the next expedition to spot the island was joseph fuller and his ship francis allyn in 1893,  but he was not able to land on the island  german carl chun s valdivia expedition arrived at the island in 1898.  they were not able to land  but dredged the seabed for geological they were also the first to accurately fix the island s also spotted a second island in 1825,  which he named thompson island  which he placed 72  kilometres (45  mi  north-northeast  of liverpool island  thompson island was also reported in 1893  by fuller  but in 1898  chun did not report seeing such an island  nor has anyone however  thompson island continued to appear on maps as late as a 1967  paper suggested that the island might have disappeared in an undetected volcanic eruption  but in 1997  it was discovered that the ocean is more than 2,400  metres (7,900  ft  deep in the 1927,  the first norvegia expedition – led by harald horntvedt and financed by lars christensen – was the first to make an extended stay on the island  observations and surveying were conducted on the islands and oceanographic measurements performed in the sea around it  at ny sandefjord  a small hut was erected and  on 1  december  the norwegian flag was hoisted and the island claimed for norway  the annexation was established by a royal decree on 23  january the claim was initially protested by the united kingdom  on the basis of norris s landing and annexation  however  the british position was weakened by norris s sighting of two islands and the uncertainty as to whether he had been on thompson or liverpool  i e  bouvet  island  norris s positioning deviating from the correct location combined with the island s lack of a natural harbour and small size made the uk accept the norwegian this resulted in diplomatic negotiations between the two countries  and in november 1929,  britain renounced its claim to the second norvegia expedition arrived in 1928  with the intent of establishing a manned meteorological radio station  but a suitable location could not be by then both the flagpole and hut from the previous year had been washed away  the third norvegia expedition  led by hjalmar riiser-larsen,  arrived the following year and built a new hut at kapp circoncision and on larsøya  the expedition carried out aerial photography of the island and was the first

island has been frequently visited by norwegian antarctic expeditions  in 1977,  an automated weather station was constructed  and for two months in 1978  and 1979  a manned weather station was in march 1985,  a norwegian expedition experienced sufficiently clear weather to allow the entire island to be photographed from the air  resulting in the first accurate map of the whole island  247  years after its the norwegian polar institute established a 36-square-metre  (390  sq ft  research station  made of shipping containers  at nyrøysa in 1996.  on 23  february 2006,  the island

quotas were awarded from 2008  for a total catch of 620,000  tonnes (610,000  long tons  680,000  short there is a controversy as to whether the fisheries are sustainable  particularly in relation to
