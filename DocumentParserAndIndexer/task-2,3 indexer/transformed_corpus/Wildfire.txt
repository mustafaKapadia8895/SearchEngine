 a wildfire or wildland fire is a fire in an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs  a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire  bush fire  desert fire  forest fire  grass fire  hill fire  peat fire  vegetation fire  or veld fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420  million years wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems  flora and earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich  vegetation  seasonally dry climates  atmospheric oxygen  and widespread lightning and volcano can be characterized in terms of the cause of ignition  their physical properties  the combustible material present  and the effect of weather on the wildfires can cause damage to property and human life  but they have many beneficial effects on native vegetation  animals  and ecosystems that have evolved with many plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and however  wildfire in ecosystems where wildfire is uncommon or where non-native  vegetation has encroached may have negative ecological wildfire behaviour and severity result from the combination of factors such as available fuels  physical setting  and analyses of historical meteorological data and national fire records in western north america show the primacy of climate in driving large regional fires via wet periods that create substantial fuels or drought and warming that extend conducive fire of wildfire prevention  detection  and suppression have varied over the one common and inexpensive technique is controlled burning  permitting or even igniting smaller fires to minimize the amount of flammable material available for a potential vegetation may be burned periodically to maintain high species diversity and frequent burning of surface fuels limits fuel wildland fire use is the cheapest and most ecologically appropriate policy for many fuels may also be removed by logging  but fuels treatments and thinning have no effect on severe fire behavior when under extreme weather wildfire itself is reportedly  the most effective treatment for reducing a fire s rate of spread  fireline intensity  flame length  and heat per unit of area  according to jan van wagtendonk  a biologist at the yellowstone field building codes in fire-prone  areas typically require that structures be built of flame-resistant  materials and a defensible space be maintained by clearing flammable materials within a prescribed distance from the major natural causes of wildfire ignitions most common direct human causes of wildfire ignition include arson  discarded cigarettes  power-line  arcs  as detected by arc mapping   and sparks from ignition of wildland fires via contact with hot rifle-bullet  fragments is also possible under the right wildfires can also be started in communities experiencing shifting cultivation  where land is cleared quickly and farmed until the soil loses fertility  and slash and burn forested areas cleared by logging encourage the dominance of flammable grasses  and abandoned logging roads overgrown by vegetation may act as fire corridors  annual grassland fires in southern vietnam stem in part from the destruction of forested areas by us military herbicides  explosives  and mechanical land-clearing  and -burning  operations during the vietnam most common cause of wildfires varies throughout the world  in canada and northwest china  for example  lightning operates as the major source of ignition  in other parts of the world  human involvement is a major contributor  in africa  central america  fiji  mexico  new zealand  south america  and southeast asia  wildfires can be attributed to human activities such as agriculture  animal husbandry  and land-conversion  burning  in china and in the mediterranean basin  human carelessness is a major cause of wildfires  in the united states and australia  the source of wildfires can be traced both to lightning strikes and to human activities  such as machinery sparks  cast-away  cigarette butts  or coal seam fires burn in the thousands around the world  such as those in burning mountain  new south wales  centralia  pennsylvania  and several coal-sustained  fires in china  they can also flare up unexpectedly and ignite nearby flammable spread of wildfires varies based on the flammable material present  its vertical arrangement and moisture content  and weather fuel arrangement and density is governed in part by topography  as land shape determines factors such as available sunlight and water for plant growth  overall  fire types can be generally characterized by their fuels as follows wildfires occur when all of the necessary elements of a fire triangle come together in a susceptible area  an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation  that is subjected to sufficient heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air  a high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation  because higher temperatures are required to evaporate any water within the material and heat the material to its fire dense forests usually provide more shade  resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity  and are therefore less susceptible to less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration  but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil  humidity  or when this balance is not maintained  plants dry out and are therefore more flammable  often a consequence of wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion  where unburned material meets active flames  or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned as the front approaches  the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation  first  wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100  °c (212  °f   next  the pyrolysis of wood at 230  °c (450  °f  releases flammable gases  finally  wood can smoulder at 380  °c (720  °f  or  when heated sufficiently  ignite at 590  °c (1,000  even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location  heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800  °c (1,470  °f   which pre-heats  and dries flammable materials  causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread high-temperature  and long-duration  surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching  the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from have a rapid forward rate of spread  fros  when burning through dense

front  or burn in the opposite direction of the main front by they may also spread by jumping or spotting as winds and vertical convection columns carry firebrands  hot wood embers  and other burning materials through the air over roads  rivers  and other barriers that may otherwise act as torching and fires in tree canopies encourage spotting  and dry ground fuels that surround a wildfire are especially vulnerable to ignition from spotting can create spot fires as hot embers and firebrands ignite fuels downwind from the fire  in australian bushfires  spot fires are known to occur as far as 20  kilometres (12  mi  from the fire large wildfires may affect air currents in their immediate vicinities by the stack effect  air rises as it is heated  and large wildfires create powerful updrafts that will draw in new  cooler air from surrounding areas in thermal great vertical differences in temperature and humidity encourage pyrocumulus clouds  strong winds  and fire whirls with the force of tornadoes at speeds of more than 80  kilometres per hour (50  rapid rates of spread  prolific crowning or spotting  the presence of fire whirls  and strong convection columns signify extreme thermal heat from wildfire can cause significant weathering of rocks and boulders  heat can rapidly expand a boulder and thermal shock can occur  which may cause an object s structure to fail heat waves  droughts  cyclical climate changes such as el niño  and regional weather patterns such as high-pressure  ridges can increase the risk and alter the behavior of wildfires years of precipitation followed by warm periods can encourage more widespread fires and longer fire since the mid-1980s,  earlier snowmelt and associated warming has also been associated with an increase in length and severity of the wildfire season in the western united global warming may increase the intensity and frequency of droughts in many areas  creating more intense and frequent a 2015  indicates that the increase in fire risk in california may be attributable to human-induced  climate a study of alluvial sediment deposits going back over 8,000  years found warmer climate periods experienced severe droughts and stand-replacing  fires and concluded climate was such a powerful influence on wildfire that trying to recreate presettlement forest structure is likely impossible in a warmer also increases during daytime hours  burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day due to lower humidity  increased temperatures  and increased wind sunlight warms the ground during the day which creates air currents that travel uphill  at night the land cools  creating air currents that travel downhill  wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through fires in europe occur frequently during the hours of 12:00  p m  and 2:00  wildfire suppression operations in the united states revolve around a 24-hour  fire day that begins at 10:00  a m  due to the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems  flora and wildfires are common in climates that are sufficiently moist to allow the growth of vegetation but feature extended dry  hot such places include the vegetated areas of australia and southeast asia  the veld in southern africa  the fynbos in the western cape of south africa  the forested areas of the united states and canada  and the mediterranean basin.high-severity  wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat  also called “snag forest habitat”   which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old plant and animal species in most types of north american forests evolved with fire  and many of these species depend on wildfires  and particularly high-severity  fires  to reproduce and grow  fire helps to return nutrients from plant matter back to soil  the heat from fire is necessary to the germination of certain types of seeds  and the snags  dead trees  and early successional forests created by high-severity  fire create habitat conditions that are beneficial to early successional forests created by high-severity  fire support some of the highest levels of native biodiversity found in temperate conifer post-fire  logging has no ecological benefits and many negative impacts  the same is often true for post-fire  some ecosystems rely on naturally occurring fires to regulate growth  some ecosystems suffer from too much fire  such as the chaparral in southern california and lower elevation deserts in the american southwest  the increased fire frequency in these ordinarily fire-dependent  areas has upset natural cycles  damaged native plant communities  and encouraged the growth of non-native  invasive species  such as lygodium microphyllum and bromus tectorum  can grow rapidly in areas that were damaged by fires  because they are highly flammable  they can increase the future risk of fire  creating a positive feedback loop that increases fire frequency and further alters native vegetation the amazon rainforest  drought  logging  cattle ranching practices  and slash-and-burn  agriculture damage fire-resistant  forests and promote the growth of flammable brush  creating a cycle that encourages more fires in the rainforest threaten its collection of diverse species and produce large amounts of also  fires in the rainforest  along with drought and human involvement  could damage or destroy more than half of the amazon rainforest by the year wildfires generate ash  destroy available organic nutrients  and cause an increase in water runoff  eroding away other nutrients and creating flash flood a 2003  wildfire in the north yorkshire moors destroyed 2.5  square kilometers (600  acres  of heather and the underlying peat layers  afterwards  wind erosion stripped the ash and the exposed soil  revealing archaeological remains dating back to 10,000  wildfires can also have an effect on climate change  increasing the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere and inhibiting vegetation growth  which affects overall carbon uptake by tundra there is a natural pattern of accumulation of fuel and wildfire which varies depending on the nature of vegetation and terrain  research in alaska has shown fire-event  return intervals   fris  that typically vary from 150  to 200  years with dryer lowland areas burning more frequently than wetter upland in wildfire-prone  ecosystems often survive through adaptations to their local fire regime  such adaptations include physical protection against heat  increased growth after a fire event  and flammable materials that encourage fire and may eliminate competition  for example  plants of the genus eucalyptus contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard sclerophyll leaves to resist heat and drought  ensuring their dominance over less fire-tolerant  dense bark  shedding lower branches  and high water content in external structures may also protect trees from rising fire-resistant  seeds and reserve shoots that sprout after a fire encourage species preservation  as embodied by pioneer species  smoke  charred wood  and heat can stimulate the germination of seeds in a process called exposure to smoke from burning plants promotes germination in other types of plants by inducing the production of the orange in western sabah  malaysian pine forests  and indonesian casuarina

brush away the covering  then blossom almost sequoia rely on periodic fires to reduce competition  release seeds from their cones  and clear the soil and canopy for new caribbean pine in bahamian pineyards have adapted to and rely on low-intensity,  surface fires for survival and growth  an optimum fire frequency for growth is every 3  to 10  years  too frequent fires favor herbaceous plants  and infrequent fires favor species typical of bahamian dry of the earth s weather and air pollution resides in the troposphere  the part of the atmosphere that extends from the surface of the planet to a height of about 10  kilometers (6  mi   the vertical lift of a severe thunderstorm or pyrocumulonimbus can be enhanced in the area of a large wildfire  which can propel smoke  soot  and other particulate matter as high as the lower previously  prevailing scientific theory held that most particles in the stratosphere came from volcanoes  but smoke and other wildfire emissions have been detected from the lower pyrocumulus clouds can reach 6,100  meters (20,000  ft  over satellite observation of smoke plumes from wildfires revealed that the plumes could be traced intact for distances exceeding 1,600  kilometers (1,000  computer-aided  models such as calpuff may help predict the size and direction of wildfire-generated  smoke plumes by using atmospheric dispersion can affect local atmospheric and release carbon in the form of carbon wildfire emissions contain fine particulate matter which can cause cardiovascular and respiratory increased fire byproducts in the troposphere can increase ozone concentration beyond safe forest fires in indonesia in 1997  were estimated to have released between 0.81  and 2.57  gigatonnes (0.89  and 2.83  billion short tons  of co2  into the atmosphere  which is between 13%–40%  of the annual global carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil atmospheric models suggest that these concentrations of sooty particles could increase absorption of incoming solar radiation during winter months by as much as the welsh borders  the first evidence of wildfire is rhyniophytoid plant fossils preserved as charcoal  dating to the silurian period  about 420  million years ago   smoldering surface fires started to occur sometime before the early devonian period 405  million years ago  low atmospheric oxygen during the middle and late devonian was accompanied by a decrease in charcoal additional charcoal evidence suggests that fires continued through the carboniferous period  later  the overall increase of atmospheric oxygen from 13%  in the late devonian to 30-31%  by the late permian was accompanied by a more widespread distribution of later  a decrease in wildfire-related  charcoal deposits from the late permian to the triassic periods is explained by a decrease in oxygen during the paleozoic and mesozoic periods followed patterns similar to fires that occur in modern times  surface fires driven by dry needed  are evident in devonian and carboniferous progymnosperm forests  lepidodendron forests dating to the carboniferous period have charred peaks  evidence of crown fires  in jurassic gymnosperm forests  there is evidence of high frequency  light surface the increase of fire activity in the late is possibly due to the increase of c4-type  grasses  as these grasses shifted to more mesic habitats  their high flammability increased fire frequency  promoting grasslands over however  fire-prone  habitats may have contributed to the prominence of trees such as those of the genera eucalyptus  pinus and sequoia  which have thick bark to withstand fires and employ human use of fire for agricultural and hunting purposes during the paleolithic and mesolithic ages altered the preexisting landscapes and fire regimes  woodlands were gradually replaced by smaller vegetation that facilitated travel  hunting  seed-gathering  and in recorded human history  minor allusions to wildfires were mentioned in the bible and by classical writers such as homer  however  while ancient hebrew  greek  and roman writers were aware of fires  they were not very interested in the uncultivated lands where wildfires wildfires were used in battles throughout human history as early thermal weapons  from the middle ages  accounts were written of occupational burning as well as customs and laws that governed the use of fire  in germany  regular burning was documented in 1290  in the odenwald and in 1344  in the black in the 14th  century sardinia  firebreaks were used for wildfire protection  in spain during the 1550s,  sheep husbandry was discouraged in certain provinces by philip ii due to the harmful effects of fires used in as early as the 17th  century  native americans were observed using fire for many purposes including cultivation  signaling  and warfare  scottish botanist david douglas noted the native use of fire for tobacco cultivation  to encourage deer into smaller areas for hunting purposes  and to improve foraging for honey and grasshoppers  charcoal found in sedimentary deposits off the pacific coast of central america suggests that more burning occurred in the 50  years before the spanish colonization of the americas than after the in the post-world  war ii baltic region  socio-economic  changes led more stringent air quality standards and bans on fires that eliminated traditional burning in the mid-19th  century  explorers from the hms beagle observed australian aborigines using fire for ground clearing  hunting  and regeneration of plant food in a method later named fire-stick  such careful use of fire has been employed for centuries in the lands protected by kakadu national park to encourage typically occurred during periods of increased temperature and drought  an increase in fire-related  debris flow in alluvial fans of northeastern yellowstone national park was linked to the period between ad 1050  and 1200,  coinciding with the medieval warm however  human influence caused an increase in fire frequency  dendrochronological fire scar data and charcoal layer data in finland suggests that  while many fires occurred during severe drought conditions  an increase in the number of fires during 850  bc and 1660  ad can be attributed to human charcoal evidence from the americas suggested a general decrease in wildfires between 1  ad and 1750  compared to previous years  however  a period of increased fire frequency between 1750  and 1870  was suggested by charcoal data from north america and asia  attributed to human population growth and influences such as land clearing practices  this period was followed by an overall decrease in burning in the 20th  century  linked to the expansion of agriculture  increased livestock grazing  and fire prevention a meta-analysis  found that 17  times more land burned annually in california before 1800  compared to recent decades (1,800,000  hectares year compared to 102,000  to a paper published in science  the number of natural and human-caused  fires decreased by 24.3%  between 1998  and 2015.  researchers explain this a transition from nomadism to settled lifestyle and intensification of agriculture that lead to a drop in the use of fire for land species moved by humans have in some cases increased the intensity of wildfires  such as eucalyptus in california and gamba grass in australia wildfire prevention refers to the preemptive methods aimed at reducing the risk of fires as well as lessening its severity and prevention techniques aim to manage air quality  maintain ecological balances  protect and to affect future north american firefighting policies permit naturally caused fires to burn to maintain their ecological role  so long as the risks of escape into high-value  areas are however  prevention policies must consider the role that humans play in wildfires  since  for example  95%  of forest fires in europe are related to human sources of human-caused  fire may include arson  accidental ignition  or the uncontrolled use of fire in land-clearing  and agriculture such as the slash-and-burn  farming in southeast 1937,  u s  president franklin d  roosevelt initiated a nationwide fire prevention campaign  highlighting the role of human carelessness in forest fires  later posters of the program featured uncle sam  leaders of the axis powers of world war ii  characters from the disney movie bambi  and the official mascot of the u s  forest service  smokey reducing human-caused  ignitions may be the most effective means of reducing unwanted wildfire  alteration of fuels is commonly undertaken when attempting to affect future fire risk and wildfire prevention programs around the world may employ techniques such as wildland fire use and prescribed or controlled wildland fire use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn  controlled burns are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather may be burned periodically to maintain high species diversity and frequent burning of surface fuels limits fuel wildland fire use is the cheapest and most ecologically appropriate policy for many fuels may also be removed by logging  but fuels treatments and thinning have no effect on severe fire wildfire models are often used to predict and compare the benefits of different fuel treatments on future wildfire spread  but their accuracy is itself is reportedly  the most effective treatment for reducing a fire s rate of spread  fireline intensity  flame length  and heat per

forest and their village  and patrol these lines during summer months or seasons of dry continued residential development in fire-prone  areas and rebuilding structures destroyed by fires has been met with the ecological benefits of fire are often overridden by the economic and safety benefits of protecting structures and human and effective detection is a key factor in wildfire early detection efforts were focused on early response  accurate results in both daytime and nighttime  and the ability to prioritize fire fire lookout towers were used in the united states in the early 20th  century and fires were reported using telephones  carrier pigeons  and aerial and land photography using instant cameras were used in the 1950s  until infrared scanning was developed for fire detection in the 1960s.  however  information analysis and delivery was often delayed by limitations in communication technology  early satellite-derived  fire analyses were hand-drawn  on maps at a remote site and sent via overnight mail to the fire manager  during the yellowstone fires of 1988,  a data station was established in west yellowstone  permitting the delivery of satellite-based  fire information in approximately four public hotlines  fire lookouts in towers  and ground and aerial patrols can be used as a means of early detection of forest fires  however  accurate human observation may be limited by operator fatigue  time of day  time of year  and geographic location  electronic systems have gained popularity in recent years as a possible resolution to human operator error  a government report on a recent trial of three automated camera fire detection systems in australia did  however  conclude     detection by the camera systems was slower and less reliable than by a trained human observer   these systems may be semi-  or fully automated and employ systems based on the risk area and degree of human presence  as suggested by gis data analyses  an integrated approach of multiple systems can be used to merge satellite data  aerial imagery  and personnel position via global positioning system  gps  into a collective whole for near-realtime  use by wireless incident command small  high risk area that features thick vegetation  a strong human presence  or is close to a critical urban area can be monitored using a local sensor network  detection systems may include wireless sensor networks that act as automated weather systems  detecting temperature  humidity  and these may be battery-powered,  solar-powered,  or tree-rechargeable:  able to recharge their battery systems using the small electrical currents in plant larger  medium-risk  areas can be monitored by scanning towers that incorporate fixed cameras and sensors to detect smoke or additional factors such as the infrared signature of carbon dioxide produced by fires  additional capabilities such as night vision  brightness detection  and color change detection may also be incorporated into sensor and aerial monitoring through the use of planes  helicopter  or uavs can provide a wider view and may be sufficient to monitor very large  low risk areas  these more sophisticated systems employ gps and aircraft-mounted  infrared or high-resolution  visible cameras to identify and target satellite-mounted  sensors such as envisat s advanced along track scanning radiometer and european remote-sensing  satellite s along-track  scanning radiometer can measure infrared radiation emitted by fires  identifying hot spots greater than 39  °c (102  the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s

usfs  which uses data from the suomi national polar-orbiting  partnership  npp  satellite to detect smaller fires in more detail than previous space-based  products  the high-resolution  data is used with a computer model to predict how a fire will change direction based on weather and land conditions  the active fire detection product using data from suomi npp s visible infrared imaging radiometer suite  viirs  increases the resolution of fire observations to 1,230  feet (375  meters   previous nasa satellite data products available since the early 2000s  observed fires at 3,280  foot (1  kilometer  resolution  the data is one of the intelligence tools used by the usfs and department of interior agencies across the united states to guide resource allocation and strategic fire management decisions  the enhanced viirs fire product enables detection every 12  hours or less of much smaller fires and provides more detail and consistent tracking of fire lines during long duration wildfires – capabilities critical for early warning systems and support of routine mapping of fire progression  active fire locations are available to users within minutes from the satellite overpass through data processing facilities at the usfs remote sensing applications center  which uses technologies developed by the nasa goddard space flight center direct readout laboratory in greenbelt  maryland  the model uses data on weather conditions and the land surrounding an active fire to predict 12–18  hours in advance whether a blaze will shift direction  the state of colorado decided to incorporate the weather-fire  model in its firefighting efforts beginning with the 2016  fire season in 2014,  an international campaign was organized in south africa s kruger national park to validate fire detection products including the new viirs active fire data  in advance of that campaign  the meraka institute of the council for scientific and industrial research in pretoria  south africa  an early adopter of the viirs 375m  fire product  put it to use during several large wildfires in kruger the demand for timely  high-quality  fire information has increased in recent years  wildfires in the united states burn an average of 7  million acres of land each year  for the last 10  years  the usfs and department of interior have spent a combined average of about $2–4  billion annually on wildfire suppression wildfire suppression depends on the technologies available in the area in which the wildfire occurs  in less developed nations the techniques used can be as simple as throwing sand or beating the fire with sticks or palm in more advanced nations  the suppression methods vary due to increased technological capacity  silver iodide can be used to encourage snow while fire retardants and water can be dropped onto fires by unmanned aerial vehicles  planes  and complete fire suppression is no longer an expectation  but the majority of wildfires are often extinguished before they grow out of control  while more than 99%  of the 10,000  new wildfires each year are contained  escaped wildfires under extreme weather conditions are difficult to suppress without a change in the weather  wildfires in canada and the us burn an average of 54,500  square kilometers (13,000,000  acres  per all  fighting wildfires can become deadly  a wildfire s burning front may also change direction unexpectedly and jump across fire breaks  intense heat and smoke can lead to disorientation and loss of appreciation of the direction of the fire  which can make fires particularly dangerous  for example  during the 1949  mann gulch fire in montana  usa  thirteen smokejumpers died when they lost their communication links  became disoriented  and were overtaken by the in the australian february 2009  victorian bushfires  at least 173  people died and over 2,029  homes and 3,500  structures were lost when they became engulfed by california  the u s  forest service spends about $200  million per year to suppress 98%  of wildfires and up to $1  billion to suppress the other 2%  of fires that escape initial attack and become fire fighters face several life-threatening  hazards including heat stress  fatigue  smoke and dust  as well as the risk of other injuries such as burns  cuts and scrapes  animal bites  and even in hot weather condition  fires present the risk of heat stress  which can entail feeling heat  fatigue  weakness  vertigo  headache  or nausea  heat stress can progress into heat strain  which entails physiological changes such as increased heart rate and core body temperature  this can lead to heat-related  illnesses  such as heat rash  cramps  exhaustion or heat stroke  various factors can contribute to the risks posed by heat stress  including strenuous work  personal risk factors such as age and fitness  dehydration  sleep deprivation  and burdensome personal protective equipment  rest  cool water  and occasional breaks are crucial to mitigating the effects of heat ash  and debris can also pose serious respiratory hazards to wildland fire fighters  the smoke and dust from wildfires can contain gases such as carbon monoxide  sulfur dioxide and formaldehyde  as well as particulates such as ash and silica  to reduce smoke exposure  wildfire fighting crews should  whenever possible  rotate firefighters through areas of heavy smoke  avoid downwind firefighting  use equipment rather than people in holding areas  and minimize mop-up.  camps and command posts should also be located upwind of wildfires  protective clothing and equipment can also help minimize exposure to smoke and are also at risk of cardiac events including strokes and heart attacks  fire fighters should maintain good physical fitness  fitness programs  medical screening and examination programs which include stress tests can minimize the risks of firefighting cardiac other injury hazards wildland fire fighters face include slips  trips and falls  burns  scrapes and cuts from tools and equipment  being struck by trees  vehicles  or other objects  plant hazards such as thorns and poison ivy  snake and animal bites  vehicle crashes  electrocution from power lines or lightning storms  and unstable building retardants are used to slow wildfires by inhibiting combustion  they are aqueous solutions of ammonium phosphates and ammonium sulfates  as well as thickening the decision to apply retardant depends on the magnitude  location and intensity of the wildfire  in certain instances  fire retardant may also be applied as a precautionary fire defense fire retardants contain the same agents as fertilizers  fire retardant may also affect water quality through leaching  eutrophication  or misapplication  fire retardant s effects on drinking water remain dilution factors  including water body size  rainfall  and water flow rates lessen the concentration and potency of fire wildfire debris  ash and sediment  clog rivers and reservoirs increasing the risk for floods and erosion that ultimately slow and or damage water treatment there is continued concern of fire retardant effects on land  water  wildlife habitats  and watershed quality  additional research is needed  however  on the positive side  fire retardant  specifically its nitrogen and phosphorus components  has been shown to have a fertilizing effect on nutrient-deprived  soils and thus creates a temporary increase in usda procedure maintains that the aerial application of fire retardant in the united states must clear waterways by a minimum of 300  feet in order to safeguard effects of retardant runoff  aerial uses of fire retardant are required to avoid application near waterways and endangered species  plant and animal habitats   after any incident of fire retardant misapplication  the u s  forest service requires reporting and assessment impacts be made in order to determine mitigation  remediation  and or restrictions on future retardant uses in that area wildfire modeling is concerned with numerical simulation of wildfires in order to comprehend and predict fire wildfire modeling aims to aid wildfire suppression  increase the safety of firefighters and the public  and minimize damage  using computational science  wildfire modeling involves the statistical analysis of past fire events to predict spotting risks and front behavior  various wildfire propagation models have been proposed in the past  including simple ellipses and egg-  and fan-shaped  models  early attempts to determine wildfire behavior assumed terrain and vegetation uniformity  however  the exact behavior of a wildfire s front is dependent on a variety of factors  including windspeed and slope steepness  modern growth models utilize a combination of past ellipsoidal descriptions and huygens  principle to simulate fire growth as a continuously expanding extreme value theory may also be used to predict the size of large wildfires  however  large fires that exceed suppression capabilities are often regarded as statistical outliers in standard analyses  even though fire policies are more influenced by large wildfires than by small risk is the chance that a wildfire will start in or reach a particular area and the potential loss of human values if it does  risk is dependent on variable factors such as human activities  weather patterns  availability of wildfire fuels  and the availability or lack of resources to suppress a wildfires have continually been a threat to human populations  however  human induced geographical and climatic changes are exposing populations more frequently to wildfires and increasing wildfire risk  it is speculated that the increase in wildfires arises from a century of wildfire suppression coupled with the rapid expansion of human developments into fire-prone  wildfires are naturally occurring events that aid in promoting forest health  global warming and climate changes are causing an increase in temperatures and more droughts nationwide which contributes to an increase in wildfire most noticeable adverse effect of wildfires is the destruction of property  however  the release of hazardous chemicals from the burning of wildland fuels also significantly impacts health in humans wildfire smoke is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water vapor  other common smoke components present in lower concentrations are carbon monoxide  formaldehyde  acrolein  polyaromatic hydrocarbons  and small particulates suspended in air which come in solid form or in liquid droplets are also present in smoke  80  -90%  of wildfire smoke  by mass  is within the fine particle size class of 2.5  micrometers in diameter or carbon dioxide s high concentration in smoke  it poses a low health risk due to its low toxicity  rather  carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter  particularly 2.5  µm in diameter and smaller  have been identified as the major health other chemicals are considered to be significant hazards but are found in concentrations that are too low to cause detectable health effects the degree of wildfire smoke exposure to an individual is dependent on the length  severity  duration  and proximity of the fire  people are exposed directly to smoke via the respiratory tract though inhalation of air pollutants  indirectly  communities are exposed to wildfire debris that can contaminate soil and water supplies the u s  environmental protection agency  epa  developed the air quality index  aqi   a public resource that provides national air quality standard concentrations for common air pollutants  the public can use this index as a tool to determine their exposure to hazardous air pollutants based on visibility are at the greatest risk for acute and chronic health effects resulting from wildfire smoke exposure  due to firefighters  occupational duties  they are frequently exposed to hazardous chemicals at a close proximity for longer periods of time  a case study on the exposure of wildfire smoke among wildland firefighters shows that firefighters are exposed to significant levels of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants above osha-permissible  exposure limits  pel  and acgih threshold limit values  tlv   5–10%  are overexposed  the study obtained exposure concentrations for one wildland firefighter over a 10-hour  shift spent holding down a fireline  the firefighter was exposed to a wide range of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritant  combination of particulate matter 3.5  µm and smaller  acrolein  and formaldehype  levels  carbon monoxide levels reached up to 160ppm  and the tlv irritant index value reached a high of 10.  in contrast  the osha pel for carbon monoxide is 30ppm  and for the tlv respiratory irritant index  the calculated threshold limit value is 1;  any value above 1  exceeds exposure 2001  and 2012,  over 200  fatalities occurred among wildland firefighters  in addition to heat and chemical hazards  firefighters are also at risk for electrocution from power lines  injuries from equipment  slips  trips  and falls  injuries from vehicle rollovers  heat-related  illness  insect bites and stings  stress  and in communities surrounding wildfires are exposed to lower concentrations of chemicals  but they are at a greater risk for indirect exposure through water or soil contamination  exposure to residents is greatly dependent on individual susceptibility  vulnerable persons such as children  ages 0–4),  the elderly  ages 65  and older   smokers  and pregnant women are at an increased risk due to their already compromised body systems  even when the exposures are present at low chemical concentrations and for relatively short exposure there is evidence of an increase in material stress  as documented by researchers m h  o donnell and a m  behie  thus affecting birth outcomes  in australia  studies show that male infants born with drastically higher average birth weights were born in mostly severely fire-affected  areas  this is attributed to the fact that maternal signals directly affect fetal growth of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard  wildfire smoke is composed of carbon dioxide  water vapor  particulate matter  organic chemicals  nitrogen oxides and other compounds  the principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon matter  pm  is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets  they are characterized into two categories based on the diameter of the particle  coarse particles are between 2.5  micrometers and 10  micrometers and fine particles measure 2.5  micrometers and less  both sizes can be inhaled  coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and can cause eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing  the fine particles are more problematic because  when inhaled  they can be deposited deep into the lungs  where they are absorbed into the bloodstream  this is particularly hazardous to the very young  elderly and those with chronic conditions such as asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  copd   cystic fibrosis and cardiovascular conditions  the illnesses most commonly with exposure to fine particle from wildfire smoke are bronchitis  exacerbation of asthma or copd  and pneumonia  symptoms of these complications include wheezing and shortness of breath and cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain  rapid heart rate and monoxide  co  is a colorless  odorless gas that can be found at the highest concentration at close proximity to a smoldering fire  for this reason  carbon monoxide inhalation is a serious threat to the health of wildfire firefighters  co in smoke can be inhaled into the lungs where it is absorbed into the bloodstream and reduces oxygen delivery to the body s vital organs  at high concentrations  it can cause headache  weakness  dizziness  confusion  nausea  disorientation  visual impairment  coma and even death  however  even at lower concentrations  such as those found at wildfires  individuals with cardiovascular disease may experience chest pain and cardiac a recent study tracking the number and cause of wildfire firefighter deaths from 1990–2006  found that 21.9%  of the deaths occurred from heart important and somewhat less obvious health effect of wildfires is psychiatric diseases and disorders  both adults and children from countries ranging from the united states and canada to greece and australia who were directly and indirectly affected by wildfires were found by researchers to demonstrate several different mental conditions linked to their experience with the wildfires  these include post-traumatic  stress disorder  ptsd   depression  anxiety  and a new twist to wildfire health effects  former uranium mining sites were burned over in the summer of 2012  near north fork  idaho  this prompted concern from area residents and idaho state department of environmental quality officials over the potential spread of radiation in the resultant smoke  since those sites had never been completely cleaned up from radioactive epa has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air  through the national ambient air quality standards and monitoring of ambient air quality has been due to these monitoring programs and the incidence of several large wildfires near populated areas  epidemiological studies have been conducted and demonstrate an association between human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke an increase in pm emitted from the hayman fire in colorado in june 2002,  was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms in patients with looking at the wildfires in southern california in october 2003  in a similar manner  investigators have shown an increase in hospital admissions due to asthma during peak concentrations of children participating in the children s health study were also found to have an increase in eye and respiratory symptoms  medication use and physician recently  it was demonstrated that mothers who were pregnant during the fires gave birth to babies with a slightly reduced average birth weight compared to those who were not exposed to wildfire during birth  suggesting that pregnant women may also be at greater risk to adverse effects from worldwide it is estimated that 339,000  people die due to the effects of wildfire smoke each
