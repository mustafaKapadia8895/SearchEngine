 european windstorm is a name given to the strongest extratropical cyclones which occur across the continent of they form as cyclonic windstorms associated with areas of low atmospheric pressure  they are most common in the autumn and winter months  on average  the month when most windstorms form is january  the seasonal average is 4.6  deep low pressure areas are relatively common over the north atlantic  sometimes starting as nor easters off the new england coast  and frequently track across the north atlantic ocean towards western europe  past the north coast of britain and ireland and into the norwegian sea  however  when they track further south they can affect almost any country in europe  commonly affected countries include the united kingdom  ireland  the netherlands  norway  the faroe islands and iceland  but any country in central europe  northern europe and especially western europe is occasionally struck by such a storm system the strong wind phenomena intrinsic to european windstorms  that give rise to  damage footprints  at the surface  can be placed into three categories  namely the  warm jet   the  cold jet  and the  sting jet   these phenomena vary in terms of physical mechanisms  atmospheric structure  spatial extent  duration  severity level  predictability  and location relative to cyclone and average these storms cause economic damage €1.9  billion per year  and insurance losses of €1.4  billion per year (1990–1998).  they rank as the second highest cause of global natural catastrophe insurance loss  after u s  to the second half of the 19th  century  european windstorms were named after the person who spotted needed  usually  they would be named either by the year  the date  the saint s day of their or any other way that made them commonly known however  a storm may still be named differently in different countries  for instance  the norwegian weather service also names independently notable storms that affect which can result in multiple names being used in different countries they affect  such as an alternative scottish naming system arose in 2011  via social media twitter which resulted in the humorous naming of hurricane and hurricane fannybaws  such usage of the term hurricane is not without precedent  as the 1968  scotland storm was referred to as  hurricane low uk met office and irish forecasting service met éireann held discussions about developing a common naming system for atlantic in 2015  a pilot project by the two forecasters was launched as  name our storms  which sought public participation in naming large-scale  cyclonic windstorms affecting the uk and or ireland over the winter of an independent forecaster  the european windstorm centre  also has its own naming list  although this is not an official 1954,  karla wege  a student at the free university of berlin s meteorological institute suggested that names should be assigned to all areas of low and high pressure that influenced the weather of central the university subsequently started to name every area of high or low pressure within its weather forecasts  from a list of 260  male and 260  female names submitted by its the female names were assigned to areas of low pressure while male names were assigned to areas of high the names were subsequently exclusively used by berlin s media until february 1990,  after which the german media started to commonly use the names  however  they were not officially approved by the german meteorological service deutscher the dwd subsequently banned the usage of the names by their offices during july 1991,  after complaints had poured in about the naming however  the order was leaked to the german press agency  deutsche presse-agentur,  who ran it as its lead weather germany s zdf television channel subsequently ran a phone in poll on 17  july 1991  and claimed that 72%  of the 40,000  responses favored keeping the this made the dwd pause and think about the naming system and these days the dwd accept the naming system and request that it is 1998  a debate started about if it was discrimination to name areas of high pressure with male names and the areas of low pressure with female the issue was subsequently resolved by alternating male and female names each in november 2002  the "adopt-a-vortex"  scheme began  which allows members of the public or companies to buy naming rights for a letter chosen by the buyer that are then assigned alphabetically to high and low pressure areas in europe during each the naming comes with the slim chance that the system will be notable  the money raised by this is used by the meteorology department to maintain weather observations at the free european languages use cognates of the word huracán  ouragan  orkan  huragan  orkaan  ураган  which may or may not be differentiated from tropical hurricanes in these languages  to indicate particularly strong cyclonic winds occurring in europe  the term hurricane as applied to these storms is not in reference to the structurally different tropical cyclone of the same name  but to the hurricane strength of the wind on the beaufort scale  winds ≥ 118  km h or ≥ 73  mph  in english  use of term hurricane to refer to european windstorms is mostly discouraged  as these storms do not display the structure of tropical storms  likewise the use of the french term ouragan is similarly discouraged as hurricane is in english  as it is typically reserved for tropical storms european windstorms in latin europe are generally referred to by derivatives of tempestas  tempest  tempête  tempestado   meaning storm  weather  or season  from the latin tempus  meaning storms of this type forming between 30°  and 60°  latitude are known as extratropical cyclones  the name european windstorm reflects that these storms in europe are primarily notable for their strong winds and associated damage  which can span several nations on the continent  the strongest cyclones are called windstorms within academia and the insurance the name european windstorm has not been adopted by the uk met office in broadcasts  though it is used in their academic the media or by the general public  and appears to have gained currency in academic and insurance circles as a linguistic and terminologically neutral name for the phenomena in contrast to some other european nations there is a lack of a widely accepted name for these storms in english  the met office and uk media generally refer to these storms as severe the current definition of severe gales  which warrants the issue of a weather warning  are repeated gusts of 70  mph (110  km h  or more over inland european windstorms are also described in forecasts variously as winter winter lows  autumnal lows  atlantic lows and cyclonic needed  they are also sometimes referred to as bullseye isobars and dartboard lows in reference to their appearance on weather needed  a royal society exhibition has used the name european with north-atlantic  cyclone and north-atlantic  windstorms also being though with the advent of the  name our storms  project  they are generally known as storms the state of the north atlantic oscillation relates strongly to the frequency  intensity  and tracks of european an enhanced number of storms have been noted over the north atlantic european region during positive nao phases  compared to negative nao phases  and is due to larger areas of suitable growth conditions  the occurrence of extreme north atlantic cyclones is aligned with the nao state during the cyclones  development the strongest storms are embedded within  and form in large scale atmospheric it should be kept in mind that  on the other hand  the cyclones themselves play a major role in steering the nao aggregate european windstorm losses show a strong dependence on with losses increasing decreasing 10-15%  at all return clustering of windstorm events has also been noted  with 8  consecutive storms hitting europe during the winter of 1989/90.  lothar and martin in 1999  were separated only by 36  hours  kyrill in 2007  following only four days after hanno  and 2008  with johanna  kirsten and in 2011,  xaver  berit  moved across northern europe and just a day later another storm  named yoda  hit the same area  in december the same year  friedhelm  hergen  joachim and oliver patrick  cato dagmar  struck northern europe insurance losses from windstorms are the second greatest source of loss for any natural peril after atlantic hurricanes in the united windstorm losses exceed those caused by flooding in europe  for instance one windstorm  kyrill in 2007,  exceeded the losses of the 2007  united kingdom on average  some 200,000  buildings are damaged by high winds in the uk every windstorms wipe out electrical generation capacity across large areas  making supplementation from abroad difficult  windturbines shut down to avoid damage and nuclear capacity may shut if cooling water is contaminated or flooding of the power plant occurs   transmission capabilities can also be severely limited if power lines are brought down by snow  ice or high winds  in the wake of cyclone gudrun in 2005  denmark and latvia had difficulty importing and sweden lost 25%  of its total power capacity as the ringhals nuclear power plant and barsebäck nuclear power plant nuclear plants were shut the boxing day storm of 1998  the reactors at hunterston b nuclear power station were shut down when power was lost  possibly due to arcing at pylons caused by salt spray from the when the grid connection was restored  the generators that had powered the station during the blackout were shut down and left on  manual start   so when the power failed again the station was powered by batteries for a short time of around 30  minutes  until the diesel generators were started during this period the reactors were left without forced cooling  in a similar fashion to the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster  but the event at hunterston was rated as international nuclear event scale year later in 1999  during the lothar storm flooding at the blayais nuclear power plant resulted in a  level 2"  event on the international nuclear event cyclone lothar and martin in 1999  left 3.4  million customers in france without electricity  and forced edf to acquire all the available portable power generators in europe  with some even being brought in from these storms brought a fourth of france s high-tension  transmission lines down and 300  high-voltage  transmission pylons were toppled  it was one of the greatest energy disruptions ever experienced by a modern developed the great storm of 1987  the high voltage cross-channel  link between the uk and france was interrupted  and the storm caused a domino-effect  of power outages throughout the southeast of conversely windstorms can produce too much wind power  cyclone xynthia hit europe in 2010,  generating 19000  megawatts of electricity from germany s 21000  wind turbines  the electricity produced was too much for consumers to use  and prices on the european energy exchange in leipzig plummeted  which resulted in the grid operators having to pay over 18  euros per megawatt-hour  to offload it  costing around half a million euros in of the gas supply during cyclone dagmar in 2011  left royal dutch shell s ormen lange gas processing plant in norway inoperable after its electricity was cut off by the storm  this left gas supplies in the united kingdom vulnerable as this facility can supply up to 20  percent of the united kingdom s needs via the langeled pipeline  fortunately the disruption came at a time of low the same storm also saw the leningrad nuclear power plant also affected  as algae and mud stirred up by the storm were sucked into the cooling system  resulting in one of the generators being shut a similar situation was reported in the wake of storm angus in 2016   though not linked specifically to the storm  when reactor 1  at torness nuclear power station in scotland was taken offline after a sea water intake tripped due to excess seaweed around the also following storm angus the uk s national grid launched an investigation into whether a ship s anchor damaged four of the eight cables of the cross channel high voltage interconnector  which would leave it only able to operate at half of its capacity until february
