 the iberian peninsula  aɪˈbɪəriən also known as iberia is located in the southwest corner of europe  the peninsula is principally divided between portugal and spain  comprising most of their territory  it also includes andorra  and a small part of france along the peninsula s northeastern edge  as well as gibraltar on its south coast  a small peninsula that forms an overseas territory of the united kingdom  with an area of approximately 582,000  km2  (225,000  sq mi   it is the second largest european peninsula  after the scandinavian the english word iberia was adapted from the use of the ancient greek word ἰβηρία  ibēría  by greek geographers under the rule of the roman empire to refer to what is known today in english as the iberian at that time  the name did not describe a single political entity or a distinct population of strabo s  iberia  was delineated from keltikē  gaul  by the and included the entire land mass southwest  he says  west   of ancient greeks reached the iberian peninsula  of which they had heard from the phoenicians  by voyaging westward on the hecataeus of miletus was the first known to use the term iberia  which he wrote about circa 500  herodotus of halicarnassus says of the phocaeans that  it was they who made the greeks acquainted with    according to prior historians used iberia to mean the country  this side of the ἶβηρος  ibēros   as far north as the river rhône in france  but currently they set the pyrenees as the limit  polybius respects that but identifies iberia as the mediterranean side as far south as gibraltar  with the atlantic side having no name  he says that saguntum is  on the seaward foot of the range of hills connecting iberia and refers to the carretanians as people  of the iberian stock  living in the pyrenees  who are distinct from either celts or celtiberians according to charles ebel  the ancient sources in both latin and greek use hispania and hiberia  greek  iberia  as synonyms  the confusion of the words was because of an overlapping in political and geographic perspectives  the latin word hiberia  similar to the greek iberia  literally translates to  land of the hiberians   this word was derived from the river ebro  which the romans called hiberus  hiber  iberian  was thus used as a term for peoples living near the river the first mention in roman literature was by the annalist poet ennius in 200  virgil refers to the ipacatos hiberos   restless iberi   in his the roman geographers and other prose writers from the time of the late roman republic called the entire peninsula hispania as they became politically interested in the former carthaginian territories  the romans began to use the names hispania citerior and hispania ulterior for  near  and  far  hispania  at the time hispania was made up of three roman provinces  hispania baetica  hispania tarraconensis  and lusitania  strabo that the romans use hispania and iberia synonymously  distinguishing between the near northern and the far southern provinces   the name  iberia  was ambiguous  being also the name of the kingdom of iberia in the caucasus  whatever language may generally have been spoken on the peninsula soon gave way to latin  except for that of the vascones  which was preserved as a language isolate by the barrier of the pyrenees the iberian peninsula has always been associated with the ebro  ibēros in ancient greek and ibērus or hibērus in latin  the association was so well known it was hardly necessary to state  for example  ibēria was the country  this side of the ibērus  in strabo  pliny goes so far as to assert that the greeks had called  the whole of spain  hiberia because of the hiberus the river appears in the ebro treaty of 226  bc between rome and carthage  setting the limit of carthaginian interest at the ebro  the fullest description of the treaty  stated in uses ibērus  with reference to this border  states that the  native name  is ibēr  apparently the original word  stripped of its greek or latin -os  or -us  termination the early range of these natives  which geographers and historians place from today s southern spain to today s southern france along the mediterranean coast  is marked by instances of a readable script expressing a yet unknown language  dubbed  iberian   whether this was the native name or was given to them by the greeks for their residence on the ebro remains unknown  credence in polybius imposes certain limitations on etymologizing  if the language remains unknown  the meanings of the words  including iber  must also remain unknown  in modern basque  the word means  valley  or  watered meadow   while means  river   but there is no proof relating the etymology of the ebro river with these basque names  in serbia  there is river ibar  but there is no proof relating the etymology of the ebro river with this serbian river name the iberian peninsula has been inhabited for at least 1.2  million years as remains found in the sites in the atapuerca mountains demonstrate  among these sites is the cave of gran dolina  where six hominin skeletons  dated between 780,000  and one million years ago  were found in 1994.  experts have debated whether these skeletons belong to the species homo erectus  homo heidelbergensis  or a new species called homo antecessor around 200,000  bp  during the lower paleolithic period  neanderthals first entered the iberian peninsula  around 70,000  bp  during the middle paleolithic period  the last glacial event began and the neanderthal mousterian culture was established  around 37,000  bp  during the upper paleolithic  the neanderthal châtelperronian cultural period began  emanating from southern france  this culture extended into the north of the peninsula  it continued to exist until around 30,000  bp  when neanderthal man faced extinction about 40,000  years ago  anatomically modern humans entered the iberian peninsula from southern here  this genetically homogeneous population  characterized by the m173  mutation in the y chromosome   developed the m343  mutation  giving rise to haplogroup r1b,  still the most common in modern portuguese and spanish on the iberian peninsula  modern humans developed a series of different cultures  such as the aurignacian  gravettian  solutrean and magdalenian cultures  some of them characterized by the complex forms of the art of the upper paleolithic during the neolithic expansion  various megalithic cultures developed in the iberian peninsula  an open seas navigation culture from the east mediterranean  called the cardium culture  also extended its influence to the eastern coasts of the peninsula  possibly as early as the 5th  millennium bc  these people may have had some relation to the subsequent development of the iberian civilization in the chalcolithic  c  3000  bc   a series of complex cultures developed that would give rise to the peninsula s first civilizations and to extensive exchange networks reaching to the baltic  middle east and north africa  around 2800  – 2700  bc  the beaker culture  which produced the maritime bell beaker  probably originated in the vibrant copper-using  communities of the tagus estuary in portugal and spread from there to many parts of western age cultures developed beginning c.1800  bc  when the civilization of los millares was followed by that of el argar  from this centre  bronze technology spread to other cultures like the bronze of levante  south-western  iberian bronze and las cogotas in the late bronze age  the urban civilisation of tartessos developed in the area of modern western andalusia  characterized by phoenician influence and using the southwest paleohispanic script for its tartessian language  not related to the iberian language early in the first millennium bc  several waves of pre-celts  and celts migrated from central europe  thus partially changing the peninsula s ethnic landscape to indo-european-speaking  in its northern and western regions  in northwestern iberia  modern northern portugal  asturias and galicia   a celtic culture developed  the castro culture  with a large number of hill forts and some fortified cities by the iron age  starting in the 7th  century bc  the iberian peninsula consisted of complex agrarian and urban civilizations  either pre-celtic  or celtic  such as the lusitanians  celtiberians  gallaeci  astures  celtici and others   the cultures of the iberians in the eastern and southern zones and the cultures of the aquitanian in the western portion of the pyrenees the seafaring phoenicians  greeks and carthaginians successively settled along the mediterranean coast and founded trading colonies there over a period of several centuries  around 1100  bc  phoenician merchants founded the trading colony of gadir or gades  modern day cádiz  near tartessos  in the 8th  century bc  the first greek colonies  such as emporion  modern empúries   were founded along the mediterranean coast on the east  leaving the south coast to the phoenicians  the greeks coined the name iberia  after the river iber  ebro   in the sixth century bc  the carthaginians arrived in the peninsula while struggling with the greeks for control of the western mediterranean  their most important colony was carthago nova (modern-day  cartagena  spain  in 218  bc  during the second punic war against the carthaginians  the first roman troops invaded the iberian peninsula  however  it was not until the reign of augustus that it was annexed after two centuries of war with the celtic and iberian tribes and the phoenician  greek and carthaginian colonies  the result was the creation of the province of hispania  it was divided into hispania ulterior and hispania citerior during the late roman republic  and during the roman empire  it was divided into hispania tarraconensis in the northeast  hispania baetica in the south and lusitania in the southwest hispania supplied the roman empire with silver  food  olive oil  wine  and metal  the emperors trajan  hadrian  marcus aurelius  and theodosius i  the philosopher seneca the younger  and the poets martial and lucan were born from families living on the iberian peninsula in the early fifth century  germanic peoples invaded the peninsula  namely the suebi  the vandals  silingi and hasdingi  and their allies  the alans  only the kingdom of the suebi  quadi and marcomanni  would endure after the arrival of another wave of germanic invaders  the visigoths  who conquered all of the iberian peninsula and expelled or partially integrated the vandals and the alans  the visigoths eventually conquered the suebi kingdom and its capital city  bracara  modern day braga   in 584–585.  they would also conquer the province of the byzantine empire (552–624)  of spania in the south of the peninsula and the balearic islands in 711,  a muslim army invaded the visigothic kingdom in hispania  under tariq ibn ziyad  the islamic army landed at gibraltar and  in an eight-year  campaign  occupied all except the northern kingdoms of the iberian peninsula in the umayyad conquest of hispania  al-andalus   arabic  الإندلس‎‎  tr  al-ʾandalūs,  possibly  land of the is the arabic name given to what is today southern spain by its muslim berber and arab occupiers from the 8th–15th  centuries  only the southern part of the iberian peninsula was incorporated into the islamic world and became a center of culture and learning  especially during the caliphate of córdoba  which reached its height under the rule of abd-ar-rahman  needed   the muslims  who were initially arabs and berbers  included some local converts  the so-called  muladi  the muslims were referred to by the generic name  moors  the reconquista gained momentum on c  718,  when the christian asturians opposed the moors  the southern march to push out the muslims continued for three hundred years  so for another four hundred years  only the southern part of the iberian peninsula was transformed into a romance-speaking  and arabic-speaking  muslim land  along with pockets of a large minority of arabic-speaking  sephardi jews many of the ousted gothic nobles took refuge in the unconquered north kingdom of asturias  from there  they aimed to reconquer their lands from the moors  this war of reconquest is known as the reconquista  christian and muslim kingdoms fought and allied among themselves  the muslim taifa kings competed in patronage of the arts  the camino de santiago attracted pilgrims from all western europe  and the jewish population set the basis of sephardi needed during the middle ages  the peninsula housed many small states including the kingdom of castile  crown of aragon  kingdom of navarre  kingdom of león and the kingdom of portugal  the peninsula was part of the almohad caliphate until they were finally uprooted  the last major muslim stronghold was granada  which was conquered by a combined castilian and aragonese force in 1492.  muslims and jews throughout the period were variously tolerated or shown intolerance in different christian kingdoms  however  after the fall of granada  all muslims and jews were ordered to convert to christianity or face expulsion  many jews and muslims fled to north africa and the ottoman empire  while others publicly converted to christianity and became known respectively as marranos and moriscos  however  many of these continued to practice their religion in secret  the moriscos revolted several times and were ultimately forcibly expelled from spain in the early 17th  century the small states gradually amalgamated over time  with the exception of portugal  even if for a brief period (1580–1640)  the whole peninsula was united politically under the iberian union  after that point  the modern position was reached and the peninsula now consists of the countries of spain and portugal  excluding their islands—the portuguese azores and madeira and the spanish canary islands and balearic islands  and the spanish exclaves of ceuta and melilla   andorra  french cerdagne and gibraltar the iberian peninsula is the westernmost of the three major southern european peninsulas—the iberian  italian  and balkan  it is bordered on the southeast and east by the mediterranean sea  and on the north  west  and southwest by the atlantic ocean  the pyrenees mountains are situated along the northeast edge of the peninsula  where it adjoins the rest of europe  its southern tip is very close to the northwest coast of africa  separated from it by the strait of gibraltar and the mediterranean sea the iberian peninsula extends from the southernmost extremity at punta de tarifa (36°00′15″n  5°36′37″w﻿    ﻿36.00417°n  5.61028°w﻿    36.00417;

(718  mi  based on an estimated degree length of about 90  km (56  mi  for that latitude  the irregular  roughly octagonal shape of the peninsula contained within this spherical quadrangle was compared to an ox-hide  by the geographer three quarters of that rough octagon is the meseta central  a vast plateau ranging from 610  to 760  m in it is located approximately in the centre  staggered slightly to the east and tilted slightly toward the west  the conventional centre of the iberian peninsula has long been considered getafe just south of madrid   it is ringed by mountains and contains the sources of most of the rivers  which find their way through gaps in the mountain barriers on all sides the coastline of the iberian peninsula is 3,313  km (2,059  mi   1,660  km (1,030  mi  on the mediterranean side and 1,653  km (1,027  mi  on the atlantic the coast has been inundated over time  with sea levels having risen from a minimum of 115–120  m (377–394  ft  lower than today at the last glacial maximum  lgm  to its current level at 4,000  years the coastal shelf created by sedimentation during that time remains below the surface  however  it was never very extensive on the atlantic side  as the continental shelf drops rather steeply into the depths  an estimated 700  km (430  mi  length of atlantic shelf is only 10–65  km (6.2–40.4  mi  wide  at the 500  m (1,600  ft

ultimately  the shelf drops into the bay of biscay on the north  an abyss   the iberian abyssal plain at 4,800  m (15,700  ft  on the west  and tagus abyssal plain to the south  in the north  between the continental shelf and the abyss  is an extension called the galicia bank  a plateau that also contains the porto  vigo  and vasco da gama seamounts  which form the galicia interior basin  the southern border of these features is marked by nazaré canyon  which splits the continental shelf and leads directly into the abyss the major rivers flow through the wide valleys between the mountain systems  these are the ebro  douro  tagus  guadiana and guadalquivir  all rivers in the iberian peninsula are subject to seasonal variations in flow the tagus is the longest river on the peninsula and  like the douro  flows westwards with its lower course in portugal  the guadiana river bends southwards and forms the border between spain and portugal in the last stretch of its course the terrain of the iberian peninsula is largely mountainous  the major mountain systems are the iberian peninsula contains rocks of every geological period from the ediacaran to the recent  and almost every kind of rock is represented  world-class  mineral deposits can also be found there  the core of the iberian peninsula consists of a hercynian cratonic block known as the iberian massif  on the northeast  this is bounded by the pyrenean fold belt  and on the southeast it is bounded by the baetic system  these twofold chains are part of the alpine belt  to the west  the peninsula is delimited by the continental boundary formed by the magma-poor  opening of the atlantic ocean  the hercynian foldbelt is mostly buried by mesozoic and tertiary cover rocks to the east  but nevertheless outcrops through the sistema ibérico and the catalan mediterranean system the iberian peninsula has two dominant climate types  one of these is the oceanic climate seen in the atlantic coastal region resulting in evenly temperatures with relatively cool summers  however  most of portugal and spain have a mediterranean climate with various precipitation and temperatures depending on latitude and position versus the sea  there are also more localized semi-arid  climates in central spain  with temperatures resembling a more continental mediterranean climate  in other extreme cases highland alpine climates such as in sierra nevada and areas with extremely low precitipation and desert climates nor semi-arid  climates such as the area  murcia area and southern alicante area  in the spanish interior the hottest temperatures in europe are found  with córdoba averaging around 37  °c (99  °f  in the spanish mediterranean coast usually averages around 30  °c (86  °f  in summer  in sharp contrast a coruña at the northern tip of galicia has a summer daytime high average at just below 23  °c (73  this cool and wet summer climate is replicated throughout most of the northern coastline  winter temperatures are more consistent throughout the peninsula  although frosts are common in the spanish interior  even though daytime highs are usually above the freezing point  in portugal  the warmest winters of the country are found in the area of algarve  very similar to the ones from huelva in spain  while most of the portuguese atlantic coast has fresh and humid winters  similar to galicia political divisions of the iberian peninsula sorted by area the main metropolitan areas of the iberian peninsula are madrid  barcelona  lisbon  valencia  porto  seville  bilbao  braga  málaga  central asturias (gijón-oviedo-avilés),  alicante-elche,  murcia and coimbra various other notable cities are also present on the peninsula  such as  elche (230,354),  oviedo (225,973),  badalona (220,977)  and terrassa (215  678)  in spain  and braga (181,874),  amadora (175,558),  coimbra (102,455)  and setúbal (90,640)  in portugal the woodlands of the iberian peninsula are distinct ecosystems  although the various regions are each characterized by distinct vegetation  there are some similarities across the peninsula while the borders between these regions are not clearly defined  there is a mutual influence that makes it very hard to establish boundaries and some species find their optimal habitat in the intermediate areas the iberian peninsula in an important stopover on the east atlantic flyway for birds migrating from northern europe to africa  for example  curlew sandpipers rest in the region of the bay of addition to the birds migrating through  some seven million wading birds from the north spend the winter in the estuaries and wetlands of the iberian peninsula  mainly at locations on the atlantic coast  in galicia are ría de arousa  a home of grey plover   ria de ortigueira  ria de corme and ria de laxe  in portugal  the aveiro lagoon hosts recurvirostra avosetta  the common ringed plover  grey plover and little stint  ribatejo province on the tagus supports recurvirostra arosetta  grey plover  dunlin  bar-tailed  godwit and common redshank  in the sado estuary are dunlin  eurasian curlew  grey plover and common redshank  the algarve hosts red knot  common greenshank and turnstone  the guadalquivir marshes region of andalusia and the salinas de cádiz are especially rich in wintering wading birds  kentish plover  common ringed plover  sanderling  and black-tailed  godwit in addition to the others  and finally  the ebro delta is home to all the species mentioned the sole exception of basque  which is of unknown origin  all modern iberian languages descend from vulgar latin and belong to the western romance languages  throughout history  and pre-history),  many different languages have been spoken in the iberian peninsula  contributing to the formation and differentiation of the contemporaneous languages of iberia  however  most of them have become extinct or fallen into disuse  basque is the only non-indo-european  surviving language in iberia and western europe in modern times  spanish  cf  30  to 40  million speakers   portuguese  cf  around 10  million speakers   catalan  cf  around 9  million speakers   galician  cf  around 3  million speakers  and basque  cf  around 1  million are the most widely spoken languages in the iberian peninsula  spanish and portuguese have expanded beyond iberia to the rest of world  becoming global languages major industries include mining  tourism  small farms  and fishing  because the coast is so long  fishing is popular  especially sardines  tuna  cod and anchovies  most of the mining happens in the pyrenees mountains  iron  gold  coal  valuable minerals—such as lead  silver  zinc  and salt—are all mined
