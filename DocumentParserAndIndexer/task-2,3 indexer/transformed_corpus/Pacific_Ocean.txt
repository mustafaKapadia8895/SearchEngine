 the pacific ocean is the largest and deepest of earth s oceanic divisions  it extends from the arctic ocean in the north to the southern ocean  or  depending on definition  to antarctica  in the south and is bounded by asia and australia in the west and the americas in the east at 165,250,000  square kilometers (63,800,000  square miles  in area  as defined with an antarctic southern border   this largest division of the world ocean—and  in turn  the hydrosphere—covers about 46%  of earth s water surface and about one-third  of its total surface area  making it larger than all of earth s land area both the center of the water hemisphere and the western hemisphere are in the pacific ocean  the equator subdivides it into the north pacific ocean and south pacific ocean  with two exceptions  the galápagos and gilbert islands  while straddling the equator  are deemed wholly within the south its mean depth is 4,280  meters (14,040  feet   the mariana trench in the western north pacific is the deepest point in the world  reaching a depth of 10,911  meters (35,797  the western pacific has many peripheral seas though the peoples of asia and oceania have traveled the pacific ocean since prehistoric times  the eastern pacific was first sighted by europeans in the early 16th  century when spanish explorer vasco núñez de balboa crossed the isthmus of panama in 1513  and discovered the great  southern sea  which he named mar del sur  in spanish   the ocean s current name was coined by portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan during the spanish circumnavigation of the world in 1521,  as he encountered favorable winds on reaching the ocean  he called it mar pacífico  which in both portuguese and spanish means  peaceful human migrations occurred in the pacific in prehistoric times  about 3000  bc  the austronesian peoples on the island of taiwan mastered the art of long-distance  canoe travel and spread themselves and their languages south to the philippines  indonesia  and maritime southeast asia  west towards madagascar  southeast towards new guinea and melanesia  intermarrying with native papuans   and east to the islands of micronesia  oceania and trade developed all along the coast from mozambique to japan  trade  and therefore knowledge  extended to the indonesian islands but apparently not australia  by at least 878  when there was a significant islamic settlement in canton much of this trade was controlled by arabs or muslims  in 219  bc xu fu sailed out into the pacific searching for the elixir of immortality  from 1404  to 1433  zheng he led expeditions into the indian ocean the first contact of european navigators with the western edge of the pacific ocean was made by the portuguese expeditions of antónio de abreu and francisco serrão  via the lesser sunda islands  to the maluku islands  in and with jorge álvares s expedition to southern china in both ordered by afonso de albuquerque from malacca the east side of the ocean was discovered by spanish explorer vasco núñez de balboa in 1513  after his expedition crossed the isthmus of panama and reached a new he named it mar del sur  literally   sea of the south  or  south sea   because the ocean was to the south of the coast of the isthmus where he first observed the pacific later  portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan sailed the pacific east to west on a castilian  spanish  expedition of world circumnavigation starting in 1519.  magellan called the ocean pacífico  or  pacific  meaning   peaceful   because  after sailing through the stormy seas off cape horn  the expedition found calm waters  the ocean was often called the sea of magellan in his honor until the eighteenth although magellan himself died in the philippines in 1521,  spanish basque navigator juan sebastián elcano led the expedition back to spain across the indian ocean and round the cape of good hope  completing the first world circumnavigation in a single expedition in sailing around and east of the moluccas  between 1525  and 1527,  portuguese expeditions discovered the caroline the aru and papua new in 1542–43  the portuguese also reached 1564,  five spanish ships consisting of 379  explorers crossed the ocean from mexico led by miguel lópez de legazpi and sailed to the philippines and mariana for the remainder of the 16th  century  spanish influence was paramount  with ships sailing from mexico and peru across the pacific ocean to the philippines  via guam  and establishing the spanish east indies  the manila galleons operated for two and a half centuries linking manila and acapulco  in one of the longest trade routes in history  spanish expeditions also discovered tuvalu  the marquesas  the cook islands  the solomon islands  and the admiralty islands in the south in the quest for terra australis  i e    the southern land    spanish explorations in the 17th  century  such as the expedition led by the portuguese navigator pedro fernandes de queirós  discovered the pitcairn and vanuatu archipelagos  and sailed the torres strait between australia and new guinea  named after navigator luís vaz de torres  dutch explorers  sailing around southern africa  also engaged in discovery and trade  willem janszoon  made the first completely documented european landing in australia (1606),  in cape york and abel janszoon tasman circumnavigated and landed on parts of the australian continental coast and discovered tasmania and new zealand in the 16th  and 17th  century spain considered the pacific ocean a mare clausum—a sea closed to other naval powers  as the only known entrance from the atlantic the strait of magellan was at times patrolled by fleets sent to prevent entrance of non-spanish  ships  on the western end of the pacific ocean the dutch threatened the spanish 18th  century marked the beginning of major exploration by the russians in alaska and the aleutian islands  such as the first kamchatka expedition and the great northern expedition  led by the danish russian navy officer vitus bering  spain also sent expeditions to the pacific northwest reaching vancouver island in southern canada  and alaska  the french explored and settled polynesia  and the british made three voyages with james cook to the south pacific and australia  hawaii  and the north american pacific northwest  in 1768,  pierre-antoine  véron  a young astronomer accompanying louis antoine de bougainville on his voyage of exploration  established the width of the pacific with precision for the first time in one of the earliest voyages of scientific exploration was organized by spain in the malaspina expedition of 1789–1794.  it sailed vast areas of the pacific  from cape horn to alaska  guam and the philippines  new zealand  australia  and the south imperialism during the 19th  century resulted in the occupation of much of oceania by other european powers  and later  japan and the united states  significant contributions to oceanographic knowledge were made by the voyages of hms beagle in the 1830s,  with charles darwin aboard  hms challenger during the 1870s;  the uss tuscarora (1873–76);  and the german gazelle needed in oceania  france got a leading position as imperial power after making tahiti and new caledonia protectorates in 1842  and 1853  after navy visits to easter island in 1875  and 1887,  chilean navy officer policarpo toro managed to negotiate an incorporation of the island into chile with native rapanui in 1888.  by occupying easter island  chile joined the imperial by 1900  nearly all pacific islands were in control of britain  france  united states  germany  japan  and the united states gained control of guam and the philippines from spain in japan controlled most of the western pacific by 1914  and occupied many other islands during world war ii  however  by the end of that war  japan was defeated and the u s  pacific fleet was the virtual master of the ocean  since the end of world war ii  many former colonies in the pacific have become independent states the pacific separates asia and australia from the americas  it may be further subdivided by the equator into northern  north pacific  and southern  south pacific  portions  it extends from the antarctic region in the south to the arctic in the the pacific ocean encompasses approximately one-third  of the earth s surface  having an area of 165,200,000  km2  (63,800,000  sq mi —significantly larger than earth s entire landmass of some 150,000,000  km2  (58,000,000  sq approximately

the pacific ocean can be divided into three main groups known as micronesia  melanesia and polynesia  micronesia  which lies north of the equator and west of the international date line  includes the mariana islands in the northwest  the caroline islands in the center  the marshall islands to the west and the islands of kiribati in the to the southwest  includes new guinea  the world s second

continental islands  high islands  coral reefs and uplifted coral platforms  continental islands lie outside the andesite line and include new guinea  the islands of new zealand  and the philippines  some of these islands are structurally associated with nearby continents  high islands are of volcanic origin  and many contain active volcanoes  among these are bougainville  hawaii  and the solomon coral reefs of the south pacific are low-lying  structures that have built up on basaltic lava flows under the ocean s surface  one of the most dramatic is the great barrier reef off northeastern australia with chains of reef patches  a second island type formed of coral is the uplifted coral platform  which is usually slightly larger than the low coral islands  examples include banaba

quantity of small plastic fragments floating in the north-east  pacific ocean increased a hundredfold between 1972  and pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles  the main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their the rivers then empty into the ocean  often also bringing chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture  the excess of oxygen-depleting  chemicals in the water leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead debris  also known as marine litter  is human-created  waste that has ended up floating in a lake  sea  ocean  or waterway  oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines  frequently washing aground where it is known as beach addition  the pacific ocean has served as the crash site of
