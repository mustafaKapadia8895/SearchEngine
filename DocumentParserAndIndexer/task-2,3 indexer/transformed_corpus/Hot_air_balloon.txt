 a hot air balloon is a lighter than air aircraft consisting of a bag  called an envelope  which contains heated air  suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket  in some long-distance  or high-altitude  balloons  a capsule   which carries passengers and  usually  a source of heat  in most cases an open flame  the heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope  as with all aircraft  hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere  unlike gas balloons  the envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom  since the air near the bottom of the envelope is at the same pressure as the surrounding air  in modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric and the inlet of the balloon  closest to the burner flame  is made from a fire resistant material such as nomex  modern balloons have been made in all kinds of shapes  such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products  though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial,  and many commercial  applications the hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying  flight technology  the first untethered manned hot air balloon flight was performed by jean-françois  pilâtre de rozier and françois laurent d arlandes on november 21,  1783,  in paris  in a balloon created by the montgolfier the first hot-air  balloon flown in the americas was launched from the walnut street jail in philadelphia on january 9,  1793  by the french aeronaut jean pierre hot air balloons that can be propelled through the air rather than simply drifting with the wind are known as thermal airships early unmanned hot air balloons were used in china  zhuge liang of the shu han kingdom  during the three kingdoms era (220–280  ad   used airborne lanterns for military signaling  these lanterns are known chinese lanterns  simplified chinese  孔明灯  traditional chinese  brothers joseph-michel  and jacques-étienne  montgolfier developed a hot air balloon in annonay  ardeche  france  and demonstrated it publicly on september 19,  1783,  making an unmanned flight lasting 10  minutes  after experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals  the first balloon flight with humans aboard  a tethered flight  performed on or around october 15,  1783,  by jean-francois  pilatre de rozier who made at least one tethered flight from the yard of the reveillon workshop in the faubourg saint-antoine.  later that same day  pilatre de rozier became the second human to ascend into the air  reaching an altitude of 26  m (85  ft   the length of the the first free flight with human passengers was made a few weeks later  on november 21,  king louis xvi had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots  but de rozier  along with marquis françois d arlandes  petitioned successfully for the the first military use of a hot air balloon happened in 1794  during the battle of fleurus  when the french used the balloon l entreprenant for hot air balloons  with an onboard heat source  were developed by ed yost  beginning during the 1950s;  his work resulted in his first successful flight  on october 22,  the first modern hot air balloon to be made in the united kingdom  uk  was the bristol belle  built in 1967.  presently  hot air balloons are used primarily for recreation  hot air balloons are able to fly to extremely high altitudes  on november 26,  2005  vijaypat singhania set the world altitude record for highest hot air balloon flight  reaching 21,027  m (68,986  ft   he took off from downtown mumbai  india  and landed 240  km (150  mi  south in the previous record of 19,811  m (64,997  ft  had been set by per lindstrand on june 6,  1988,  in plano  texas on january 15,  1991,  the  virgin pacific flyer  balloon completed the longest flight in a hot air balloon when per lindstrand  born in sweden  but resident in the uk  and richard branson of the uk flew 7,671.91  km (4,767.10  mi  from japan to northern canada  with a volume of 74  thousand cubic meters (2.6  million cubic feet   the balloon envelope was the largest ever built for a hot air craft  designed to fly in the trans-oceanic  jet streams  the pacific flyer recorded the fastest ground speed for a manned balloon at 245  mph (394  km h   the longest duration record was set by swiss psychiatrist bertrand piccard  auguste piccard s grandson  and briton brian jones  flying in the breitling orbiter 3.  it was the first nonstop trip around the world by balloon  the balloon left château-d'oex,  switzerland  on march 1,  1999,  and landed at 1:02  a m  on march 21  in the egyptian desert 300  miles (480  km  south of cairo  the two men exceeded distance  endurance  and time records  traveling 19  days  21  hours  and 55  minutes  steve fossett  flying solo  exceeded the record for briefest time traveling around the world on 3  july 2002  on his sixth in 320  h 33  fedor konyukhov flew solo round the world on his first attempt in a hybrid hot-air/helium  balloon from 11  to 23  july for a round-the  world time of 272h  11m,  as of 17  september awaiting official confirmation as the new hot air balloon for manned flight uses a single-layered,  fabric gas bag  lifting  envelope    with an opening at the bottom called the mouth or throat  attached to the envelope is a basket  or gondola  for carrying the passengers  mounted above the basket and centered in the mouth is the  burner   which injects a flame into the envelope  heating the air within  the heater or burner is fueled by propane  a liquefied gas stored in pressure vessels  similar to high pressure forklift hot air balloons are usually made of materials such as ripstop nylon or dacron  a the manufacturing process  the material is cut into panels and sewn together  along with structural load tapes that carry the weight of the gondola or basket  the individual sections  which extend from the throat to the crown  top  of the envelope  are known as gores or gore sections  envelopes can have as few as 4  gores or as many as 24  or often have a crown ring at their very top  this is a hoop of smooth metal  usually aluminium  and approximately 1  ft (0.30  m  in diameter  vertical load tapes from the envelope are attached to the crown ring at the bottom of the envelope the vertical load tapes are sewn into loops that are connected to cables  one cable per load tape   these cables  often referred to as flying wires  are connected to the basket by carabiners the most common technique for sewing panels together is called the french felled  french fell  or double lap the two pieces of fabric are folded over on each other at their common edge  possibly with a load tape as well  and sewn together with two rows of parallel stitching  other methods include a flat lap seam  in which the two pieces of fabric are held together simply with two rows of parallel stitching  and a zigzag  where parallel zigzag stitching holds a double lap of fabric  or at least part of it  the top 1/3  for example  may be coated with a sealer  such as silicone or polyurethane  to make it impermeable to it is often the degradation of this coating and the corresponding loss of impermeability that ends the effective life of an envelope  not weakening of the fabric itself  heat  moisture  and mechanical wear-and-tear  during set-up  and pack-up  are the primary causes of degradation  once an envelope becomes too porous to fly  it may be retired and discarded or perhaps used as a  rag bag   cold inflated and opened for children to run through  products for recoating the fabric are becoming available range of envelope sizes is available  the smallest  one-person,  basket-less  balloons  called  hoppers  or  cloudhoppers   have as little as 600  m3  (21,000  cu ft  of envelope for a perfect sphere the radius would be around 5  m (16  ft   at the other end of the scale  balloons used by commercial sightseeing operations may be able to carry well over two dozen people  with envelope volumes of up to 17,000  m3  (600,000  cu the most-used  size is about 2,800  m3  (99,000  cu ft   and can carry 3  to 5  people the top of the balloon usually has a vent of some sort  enabling the pilot to release hot air to slow an ascent  start a descent  or increase the rate of descent  usually for landing  some hot air balloons have turning vents  which are side vents that  when opened  cause the balloon to rotate  such vents are particularly useful for balloons with rectangular baskets  to facilitate aligning the wider side of the basket for most common type of top vent is a disk-shaped  flap of fabric called a parachute vent  invented by tracy the fabric is connected around its edge to a set of  vent lines  that converge in the center   the arrangement of fabric and lines roughly resembles a parachute—thus the name   these  vent lines  are themselves connected to a control line that runs to the basket  a parachute vent is opened by pulling on the control line  once the control line is released  the pressure of the remaining hot air pushes the vent fabric back into place  a parachute vent can be opened briefly while in flight to initiate a rapid descent   slower descents are initiated by allowing the air in the balloon to cool naturally   the vent is pulled open completely to collapse the balloon after landing an older  and presently less commonly used  style of top vent is called a "velcro-style"  vent  this too is a disk of fabric at the top of the balloon  however  rather than having a set of  vent lines  that can repeatedly open and close the vent  the vent is secured by  hook and loop  fasteners  such as velcro  and is only opened at the end of the flight  balloons equipped with a velcro-style  vent typically have a second  maneuvering vent  built into the side  as opposed to the top  of the balloon  another common type of top design is the  smart vent   which  rather than lowering a fabric disc into the envelope as in the  parachute  type  gathers the fabric together in the center of the opening  this system can theoretically be used for in-flight  maneuvering  but is more commonly used only as a rapid-deflation  device for use after landing  of particular value in high winds  other designs  such as the  pop top  and  multivent  systems  have also attempted to address the need for rapid deflation on landing  but the parachute top remains popular as an all-around  maneuvering and deflation system besides special shapes  possibly for marketing purposes  there are several variations on the traditional  inverted tear drop  shape  the simplest  often used by home builders  is a hemisphere on top of a truncated cone  more-sophisticated  designs attempt to minimize the circumferential stress on the fabric  with different degrees of success depending on whether they take fabric weight and varying air density into account  this shape may be referred to as finally  some specialized balloons are designed to minimize aerodynamic drag  in the vertical direction  to improve flight performance in are commonly made of woven wicker or rattan  these materials have proven to be sufficiently light  strong  and durable for balloon flight  such baskets are usually rectangular or triangular in shape  they vary in size from just big enough for two people to large enough to carry larger baskets often have internal partitions for structural bracing and to compartmentalize the passengers  small holes may be woven into the side of the basket to act as foot holds for passengers climbing in or may also be made of aluminium  especially a collapsible aluminium frame with a fabric skin  to reduce weight or increase these may be used by pilots without a ground crew or who are attempting to set altitude  duration  or distance records  other specialty baskets include the fully enclosed gondolas used for around-the-world  and baskets that consist of little more than a seat for the pilot and perhaps one passenger the burner unit gasifies liquid mixes it with air  ignites the mixture  and directs the flame and exhaust into the mouth of the envelope  burners vary in power output  each will generally produce 2  to 3  mw of heat (7  to 10  million btus per hour   with double  triple  or quadruple burner configurations installed where more power is the pilot actuates a burner by opening a propane valve  known as a blast valve  the valve may be spring-loaded  so that it closes automatically  or it may stay open until closed by the pilot  the burner has a pilot light to ignite the propane and air mixture  the pilot light may be lit by the pilot with an external device  such as a flint striker or a lighter  or with a built-in  piezo electric more than one burner is present  the pilot can use one or more at a time depending on the desired heat output  each burner is characterized by a metal coil of propane tubing the flame shoots through to preheat the incoming liquid propane  the burner unit may be suspended from the mouth of the envelope  or supported rigidly over the basket  the burner unit may be mounted on a gimbal to enable the pilot to aim the flame and avoid overheating the envelope fabric  a burner may have a secondary propane valve that releases propane more slowly and thereby generates a different sound  this is called a whisper burner and is used for flight over livestock to lessen the chance of spooking them  it also generates a more yellow flame and is used for night glows because it lights up the inside of the envelope better than the primary valve propane fuel tanks are usually cylindrical pressure vessels made from aluminium  stainless steel  or titanium with a valve at one end to feed the burner and to refuel  they may have a fuel gauge and a pressure gauge  common tank sizes are 10  (38),  15  (57),  and 20  (76)  us gallons they may be intended for upright or horizontal use  and may be mounted inside or outside the basket the pressure necessary to force the fuel through the line to the burner may be supplied by the vapor pressure of the propane itself  if warm enough  or by the introduction of an inert gas such as tanks may be preheated with electrical heat tapes to produce sufficient vapor pressure for cold weather warmed tanks will usually also be wrapped in an insulating blanket to preserve heat during the setup and flight a balloon may be outfitted with a variety of instruments to aid the pilot  these commonly include an altimeter  a rate of climb  vertical speed  indicator known as a variometer  envelope  air  temperature  and ambient  air  a gps receiver can be useful to indicate ground speed  traditional aircraft air speed indicators would be useless  and direction the combined mass of an average system can be calculated as a density of 0.9486  kg m³ for dry air heated to 210  °f (99  °c  increasing the air temperature inside the envelope makes it less dense than the surrounding  ambient  air  the balloon floats because of the buoyant force exerted on it  this force is the same force that acts on objects when they are in water and is described by archimedes  principle  the amount of lift  or buoyancy  provided by a hot air balloon depends primarily upon the difference between the temperature of the air inside the envelope and the temperature of the air outside the envelope  for most envelopes made of nylon fabric  the maximum internal temperature is limited to approximately 120  °c (250  should be noted that the melting point of nylon is significantly greater than this maximum operating temperature — about 230  °c (450  °f  — but higher temperatures cause the strength of the nylon fabric to degrade more quickly over time  with a maximum operating temperature of 120  °c (250  °f   balloon envelopes can generally be flown for between 400  and 500  hours before the fabric needs to be replaced  many balloon pilots operate their envelopes at temperatures significantly less than the maximum to extend envelope fabric life the lift generated by 100,000  ft³ (2831.7  m³  of dry air heated to various temperatures may be calculated as follows the density of air at 20  °c  68  °f is about 1.2  kg m³  the total lift for a balloon of 100,000  ft³ heated to (99  °c  210  °f  would be 1595  lb  723.5  kg  this is just enough to generate neutral buoyancy for the total system mass  not including the heated air trapped in the envelope  of course  stated in the previous section  liftoff would require a slightly greater temperature  depending on the desired rate of climb  in reality  the air contained in the envelope is not all the same temperature  as the accompanying thermal image shows  and so these calculations are based on averages for typical atmospheric conditions (20  °c  68  °f   a hot air balloon heated to (99  °c  210  °f  requires about 3.91  m³ of envelope volume to lift 1  kilogram (62.5  ft³ lb   the precise amount of lift provided depends not only upon the internal temperature mentioned above  but the external temperature  altitude above sea level  and humidity of the air surrounding  on a warm day  a balloon cannot lift as much as on a cool day  because the temperature required for launch will exceed the maximum sustainable for nylon envelope fabric  also  in the lower atmosphere  the lift provided by a hot air balloon decreases about 3%  for each 1,000  meters (1%  per 1,000  ft  of altitude hot air balloons are known as montgolfier balloons and rely solely on the buoyancy of hot air provided by the burner and contained by the this style of balloon was developed by the montgolfier brothers  and had its first public demonstration on 4  june 1783  with an unmanned flight lasting 10  minutes  followed later that year with manned 1785  rozière balloon  a type of hybrid balloon  named after its creator  jean-françois  pilâtre de rozier  has a separate cell for a lighter than air gas  typically helium   as well as a cone below for hot air  as is used in a hot air balloon  to heat the helium at night  hydrogen gas was used in the very early stages of development but was quickly abandoned due to the obvious danger of introducing an open flame near the gas  all modern roziere balloons now use helium as a lifting balloons are hot air balloons that use just solar energy captured by a dark envelope to heat the air help ensure the safety of pilot and passengers  a hot air balloon may carry several pieces of safety equipment to relight the burner if the pilot light goes out and the optional piezo ignition fails  the pilot should have ready access to a means of backup ignition  such as a flint spark lighter  many systems  especially those that carry passengers  have completely duplicate fuel and burner systems  two fuel tanks  connected to two separate hoses  which feed two distinct burners  this enables a safe landing in the case of a blockage somewhere in one system or if a system must be disabled because of a fuel leak a fire extinguisher suitable for extinguishing propane fires is useful  most balloons carry a 1  or 2  kg ab e type fire extinguisher a handling or drop line is mandatory safety equipment in many countries  this is a rope or webbing of 20–30  meters in length attached to the balloon basket with a quick release connection at one end  in very calm winds the balloon pilot can throw the handling line from the balloon so that the ground crew can guide the balloon safely away from obstructions on the ground for commercial passenger balloons  a pilot restraint harness is mandatory in some countries  this consists of a hip belt and a webbing line that together allow for some movement while preventing the pilot from being ejected from the basket during a hard landing further safety equipment may include a first-aid  kit  a fire blanket and a strong rescue knife at a minimum  the pilot should wear leather or flame-retardant  fiber  such as nomex  gloves  so that they may shut off a gas valve in the case of a leak  even if there is a flame present  quick action in this regard can turn a potential catastrophe into a mere inconvenience  the pilot should additionally wear flame-resistant  clothing covering their arms and legs  either natural fiber  such as cotton  linen  hemp  or wool  or engineered flame-retardant  fiber  such as nomex  is acceptable in this capacity  most engineered fibers  with the exception of rayon  which is also safe to wear  are thermoplastic  many are also hydrocarbons  this makes such fabrics very much unsuitable to wear near high temperatures  since non-flame-retardant  thermoplastics will melt onto the wearer  and most hydrocarbons  whether fibrous or not  are suitable to use as fuels  natural fiber will singe rather than melt or burn readily  and flame-retardant  fiber generally has a very high melting point and is intrinsically non-flammable.  many pilots also advise their passengers to wear similar protective clothing that covers their arms and legs  as well as strong shoes or boots that offer good ankle support  finally  some balloon systems  especially those that hang the burner from the envelope instead of supporting it rigidly from the basket  require the use of helmets by the pilot and passengers the ground crew should wear gloves whenever there is a possibility of handling ropes or lines  the mass and exposed surface to air movement of a medium-sized  balloon is sufficient to cause rope friction burns to the hands of anyone trying to stop or prevent movement  the ground crew should also wear sturdy shoes and at least long pants in case of the need to access a landing or landed balloon in rough or overgrown terrain as with aircraft  hot air balloons require regular maintenance to remain airworthy  as aircraft made of fabric and that lack direct horizontal control  hot air balloons may occasionally require repairs to rips or snags  while some operations  such as cleaning and drying  may be performed by the owner or pilot  other operations  such as sewing  must be performed by a qualified repair technician and recorded in the balloon s maintenance log book to ensure long life and safe operation  the envelope should be kept clean and dry  this prevents mold and mildew from forming on the fabric and abrasion from occurring during packing  transport  and unpacking due to contact with foreign particles  in the event of a landing in a wet  because of precipitation or early morning or late evening dew  or muddy location  farmer s field   the envelope should be cleaned and laid out or hung to dry the burner and fuel system must also be kept clean to ensure safe operation on demand  damaged fuel hoses need to be replaced  stuck or leaky valves must be repaired or replaced  the wicker basket may require occasional refinishing or repair  the skids on its bottom may require occasional replacement balloons in most parts of the world are maintained in accordance with a fixed manufacturer s maintenance schedule that includes regular (100  flight hours or 12  month  inspections  in addition to maintenance work to correct any damage  in australia  balloons used for carrying commercial passengers must be inspected and maintained by approved the case of a snag  burn  or rip in the envelope fabric  a patch may be applied or the affected panel completely replaced  patches may be held in place with glue  tape  stitching  or a combination of these techniques  replacing an entire panel requires the stitching around the old panel to be removed  and a new panel to be sewn in with the appropriate technique  thread  and stitch pattern depending on the size of the balloon  location  and intended use  hot air balloons and their pilots need to comply with a variety of regulations as with other aircraft in the usa  balloons must be registered  have an n-number),  have an airworthiness certificate  and pass annual inspections  balloons below a certain size  empty weight of less than 155  pounds or 70  kg including envelope  basket  burners and empty fuel tanks  can be used as an ultralight aircraft in australia  private balloon pilots are managed by the australian ballooning and typically become members of regional hot air ballooning clubs  commercial operations carrying fare paying passengers or charging for promotional flights must operate under an air operators certificate from the australian civil aviation and safety authority  casa  with a nominated chief pilot  pilots must have different degrees of experience before they are allowed to progress to larger balloons  hot air balloons must be registered aircraft with casa and are subject to regular airworthiness checks by authorised the uk  the person in command must hold a valid private pilot s licence issued by the civil aviation authority specifically for ballooning  this is known as the ppl b   there are two types of commercial balloon licences  cpl b  restricted and cpl b   full   the cpl b  restricted is required if the pilot is undertaking work for a sponsor or being paid by an external agent to operate a balloon  the pilot can fly a sponsored balloon with everything paid for with a ppl unless asked to attend any event  then a cpl b  restricted is required  the cpl b  is required if the pilot is flying passengers for money  the balloon then needs a transport category c of a  certificate of air worthiness   if the pilot is only flying sponsor s guests  and not charging money for flying other passengers  then the pilot is exempted from holding an aoc  air operator s certificate  though a copy of it is needed  for passenger flying the balloon also requires a maintenance log in the united states  a pilot of a hot air balloon must have a pilot certificate from the federal aviation administration  faa  and it must carry the rating of "lighter-than-air  free balloon   and unless the pilot is also qualified to fly gas balloons  will also carry this limitation   limited to hot air balloons with airborne heater   a pilot does not need a license to fly an ultralight aircraft  but training is highly advised  and some hot air balloons meet the criteria to carry paying passengers for hire  and attend some balloon festivals   a pilot must have a commercial pilot certificate  commercial hot air balloon pilots may also act as hot air balloon flight instructors  while most balloon pilots fly for the pure joy of floating through the air  many are able to make a living as a professional balloon pilot  some professional pilots fly commercial passenger sightseeing flights  while others fly corporate advertising largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is cameron balloons company of bristol  england  which also owns lindstrand balloons of oswestry  england  cameron balloons  lindstrand balloons and another english balloon manufacturing company  thunder and colt  since acquired by cameron   have been innovators and developers of special shaped balloons  these hot air balloons use the same principle of lift as conventional inverted teardrop shaped balloons but often sections of the special balloon envelope shape do not contribute to the balloon s ability to stay aloft the second largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is ultramagic company  based in spain  which produces from 80  to 120  balloons per year  ultramagic can produce very large balloons  such as the n-500  that accommodates as many as 27  persons in the basket  and has also produced many balloons with special shapes  as well as cold-air  inflatables in the usa aerostar international  inc  of sioux falls  south dakota was north america s largest balloon manufacturer and a close second in world manufacturing before ceasing to build balloons in january 2007.  the oldest u s  certified manufacture is now adams balloons out of albuquerque  new mexico  firefly balloons  formerly the balloon works  is a manufacturer of hot-air  balloons in statesville  north carolina  another manufacturer is head balloons  inc  of helen  georgia the major manufacturers in canada are sundance balloons and fantasy sky promotions  other manufacturers include kavanagh balloons of australia  schroeder fire balloons of germany  and kubicek balloons of the czech republic
