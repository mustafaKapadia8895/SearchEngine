 a shovel is a tool for digging  lifting  and moving bulk materials  such as soil  coal  gravel  snow  sand  or ore most shovels are hand tools consisting of a broad blade fixed to a medium-length  handle  shovel blades are usually made of sheet steel or hard plastics and are very strong  shovel handles are usually made of wood  especially specific varieties such as ash or maple  or glass-reinforced  plastic  fibreglass  hand shovel blades made of sheet steel usually have a folded seam or hem at the back to make a socket for the handle  this fold also commonly provides extra rigidity to the blade  the handles are usually riveted in place  a t-piece  is commonly fitted to the end of the handle to aid grip and control where the shovel is designed for moving soil and heavy materials  these designs can all be easily mass-produced.the  term shovel also applies to larger excavating machines called power shovels  which serve the same purposeâ€”digging  lifting  and moving material  modern power shovels descend from steam shovels  loaders and excavators  such as backhoes  perform similar work  etically speaking  but are not classified as shovels emically hand shovels have been adapted for many different tasks and environments  they can be optimized for a single task or designed as cross-over  or compromise multitaskers  it s very useful in agriculture  examples are given under  types  some usage prescriptions prescribe that the words  spade  and  shovel  should be held in contradistinction  piercing and digging versus scooping and moving natural language does not widely follow these prescriptions  it more often treats  spade  and  scoop  as contradistinguished subsets under  shovel  in neolithic times and earlier a large animal s scapula  shoulder blade  was often used as a crude shovel or it is via this connection between shoulder blades and digging blades that the words spatula and spade both have etymologic connection with scapulas manual shoveling  often in combination with picking  was the chief means of excavation in construction until mechanization via steam shovels and later hydraulic equipment  excavators such as backhoes and loaders  gradually replaced most manual shoveling  the same is also true of the history of mining and quarrying and of bulk materials handling in industries such as steelmaking and stevedoring  railroad cars and cargo holds containing ore  coal  gravel  sand  or grains were often loaded and unloaded this way  these industries did not always rely exclusively on such work  but such work was a ubiquitous part of them  until the 1950s,  manual shoveling employed large numbers of workers  groups of workers called labor gangs were assigned to whatever digging or bulk materials handling was needed in any given week  and dozens or hundreds of workers with hand shovels would do the kind of rapid excavating or materials handling that today is usually accomplished with powered excavators and loaders operated by a few skilled operators  thus the cost of labor  even when each individual worker was poorly paid  was a tremendous expense of operations  productivity of the business was tied mostly to labor productivity  it still often is even today  but in the past it was even more so  in industrial and commercial materials handling  hand shoveling was later replaced not only with loaders and backhoes given the central importance and cost of manual labour in industry in the late 19th  and early 20th  centuries  the  science of shoveling  was something of great interest to developers of scientific management such as frederick winslow taylor  with his focus on time and motion study  took an interest in differentiating the many motions of manual labor to a far greater degree than others tended to  managers might not care to analyze it  figuring that brute work is brute work  case closed   and workers might not care to analyze it in any way that encouraged management to take away the prerogative in craft work for the craftsman to decide the details of his methods  taylor realized that failing to analyze shoveling practice represented a missed opportunity to discover or synthesize best practices for shoveling  which could achieve highest productivity  value for dollar spent   it was taylor and colleagues in the 1890s  through 1910s  that greatly expanded the existing idea of varied shovel designs with different-sized  scoops  one for each material  based on the material s density  under scientific management  it was no longer acceptable to use the same shovel for shoveling brown coal one day and gravel the next  taylor advocated the higher capital cost of maintaining two shovels as more than paying for itself through the increase in worker productivity that it would lead to  which would mean less money being spent on wages for each unit of shoveling work accomplished  unfortunately  despite taylor s valid insights about the possibility for applying science to manual labour  including shoveling and the lifting and carrying of heavy objects  and his valid insights about the inequality of talents between individuals  he did not really respect the human dignity of all workers  and tended to be contemptuous of people with low science of shoveling is  hand shoveling  has long since mostly faded out of commercial concern thanks to extensive mechanization  such as bulldozers and other equipment  humans are once again mostly content to let one coal scoop handle various bulk materials of differing densities during the second industrial revolution around year 1900,  the shovel gave way to heavy equipment such as excavators
