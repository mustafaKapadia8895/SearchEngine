 the antarctic ice sheet is one of the two polar ice caps of the earth  it covers about 98%  of the antarctic continent and is the largest single mass of ice on earth  it covers an area of almost 14  million square kilometres (5.4  million square miles  and contains 26.5  million cubic kilometres (6,400,000  cubic miles  of approximately 61  percent of all fresh water on the earth is held in the antarctic ice sheet  an amount equivalent to about 58  m of sea-level  in east antarctica  the ice sheet rests on a major land mass  while in west antarctica the bed can extend to more than 2,500  m below sea level in contrast to the melting of the arctic sea ice  sea ice around antarctica was expanding as of the reasons for this are not fully understood  but suggestions include the climatic effects on ocean and atmospheric circulation of the ozone and or cooler ocean surface temperatures as the warming deep waters melt the ice icing of antarctica began in the middle eocene about 45.5  million years and escalated during the eocene–oligocene extinction event about 34  million years ago  co2  levels were then about 760  and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm  carbon dioxide decrease  with a tipping point of 600  ppm  was the primary agent forcing antarctic the glaciation was favored by an interval when the earth s orbit favored cool summers but oxygen isotope ratio cycle marker changes were too large to be explained by antarctic ice-sheet  growth alone indicating an ice age of some the opening of the drake passage may have played a role as though models of the changes suggest declining co2  levels to have been more to a 2009  study  the continent-wide  average surface temperature trend of antarctica is positive and significant at >0.05  °c decade since west antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1  °c decade in the last 50  years  and this warming is strongest in winter and spring  although this is partly offset by fall cooling in east antarctica  this effect is restricted to the 1980s  and enters the sheet through precipitation as snow  this snow is then compacted to form glacier ice which moves under gravity towards the coast  most of it is carried to the coast by fast moving ice streams  the ice then passes into the ocean  often forming vast floating ice shelves  these shelves then melt or calve off to give icebergs that eventually melt if the transfer of the ice from the land to the sea is balanced by snow falling back on the land then there will be no net contribution to global sea levels  the general trend shows that a warming climate in the southern hemisphere would transport more moisture to antarctica  causing the interior ice sheets to grow  while calving events along the coast will increase  causing these areas to shrink  a 2006  paper derived from satellite data  measuring changes in the gravity of the ice mass  suggests that the total amount of ice in antarctica has begun decreasing in the past few a 2008  study compared the ice leaving the ice sheet  by measuring the ice velocity and thickness along the coast  to the amount of snow accumulation over the continent  this found that the east antarctic ice sheet was in balance but the west antarctic ice sheet was losing mass  this was largely due to acceleration of ice streams such as pine island glacier  these results agree closely with the gravity an estimate published in november 2012  and based on the grace data as well as on an improved glacial isostatic adjustment model discussed systematic uncertainty in the estimates  and by studying 26  separate regions  estimated an average yearly mass loss of 69  ± 18  gt y from 2002  to 2010.  the mass loss was geographically uneven  mainly occurring along the amundsen sea coast  while the west antarctic ice sheet mass was roughly constant and the east antarctic ice sheet gained in sea ice anomalies have roughly followed the pattern of warming  with the greatest declines occurring off the coast of west antarctica  east antarctica sea ice has been increasing since 1978,  though not at a statistically significant rate  the atmospheric warming has been directly linked to the mass losses in west antarctica of the first decade of the twenty-first  century  this mass loss is more likely to be due to increased melting of the ice shelves because of changes in ocean circulation patterns  which themselves may be linked to atmospheric circulation changes that may also explain the warming trends in west antarctica   melting of the ice shelves in turn causes the ice streams to speed the melting and disappearance of the floating ice shelves will only have a small effect on sea level  which is due to salinity the most important consequence of their increased melting is the speed up of the ice streams on land which are buttressed by these ice shelves coordinates  90°s  0°e﻿    ﻿90°s  0°e﻿    -90;  0
