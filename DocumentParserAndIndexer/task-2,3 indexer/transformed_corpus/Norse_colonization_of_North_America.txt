 the norse colonization of north america began in the late 10th  century ad when norsemen explored and settled areas of the north atlantic including the northeastern fringes of north viking houses were found at l’anse aux meadows near the northern tip of newfoundland in 1960.  this discovery aided the reignition of archaeological exploration for the vikings in the north norse colony in greenland lasted for almost 500  years  continental north american settlements were small and did not develop into permanent colonies  while voyages  for example to collect timber  are likely to have occurred for some time  there is no evidence of any lasting norse settlements on mainland north to the sagas of icelanders  norsemen from iceland first settled greenland in the 980s.  there is no special reason to doubt the authority of the information that the sagas supply regarding the very beginning of the settlement  but they cannot be treated as primary evidence for the history of norse greenland because they embody the literary preoccupations of writers and audiences in medieval iceland that are not always the red  old norse  eiríkr rauði   having been banished from iceland for manslaughter  explored the uninhabited southwestern coast of greenland during the three years of his he made plans to entice settlers to the area  naming it greenland on the assumption that  people would be more eager to go there because the land had a good the inner reaches of one long fjord  named eiriksfjord after him  was where he eventually established his estate brattahlid  he issued tracts of land to his its peak the colony consisted of two settlements  the eastern was at the southwestern tip of greenland  while the western settlement was about 500  km up the west coast  inland from present-day  nuuk  a smaller settlement near the eastern settlement is sometimes considered the middle settlement  the combined population was around at least 400  farms have been identified by norse greenland had a bishopric  at garðar  and exported walrus ivory  furs  rope  sheep  whale or seal blubber  live animals such as polar bears  supposed  unicorn horns   in reality narwhal tusks   and cattle hides  in 1126,  the population requested a bishop  headquartered at garðar   and in 1261,  they accepted the overlordship of the norwegian king  they continued to have their own law and became almost completely independent after 1349,  the time of the black death  in 1380,  the norwegian kingdom entered into a personal union with the kingdom of is evidence of norse trade with the natives  called skraelings by the vikings   the norse would have encountered both native americans  the beothuk  related to the algonquin  and the thule  the ancestors of the inuit  the dorset had withdrawn from greenland before the norse settlement of the island  items such as comb fragments  pieces of iron cooking utensils and chisels  chess pieces  ship rivets  carpenter s planes  and oaken ship fragments used in inuit boats have been found far beyond the traditional range of norse colonization  a small ivory statue that appears to represent a european has also been found among the ruins of an inuit community colony began to decline in the 14th  century  the western settlement was abandoned around 1350,  and the last bishop at garðar died in after a marriage was recorded in 1408,  no written records mention the settlers  it is probable that the eastern settlement was defunct by the late 15th  century  the most recent radiocarbon date found in norse settlements as of 2002  was 1430  (±15  years   several theories have been advanced to explain the decline the little ice age of this period would have made travel between greenland and europe  as well as farming  more difficult  although fishing and seal hunting provided a healthy diet  there was more prestige in cattle farming  and there was increased availability of farms in scandinavian countries depopulated by famine and plague epidemics  in addition  greenlandic ivory may have been supplanted in european markets by cheaper ivory from despite the loss of contact with the greenlanders  the norwegian-danish  crown continued to consider greenland a possession not knowing whether the old norse civilization remained in greenland or not—and worried that if it did  it would still be catholic 200  years after the scandinavian homelands had experienced the reformation—a joint merchant-clerical  expedition led by the dano-norwegian  missionary hans egede was sent to greenland in 1721.  though this expedition found no surviving europeans  it marked the beginning of denmark s re-assertion  of sovereignty over the island according to the icelandic sagas—eirik the red s saga of the greenlanders  plus chapters of the hauksbók and the flatey book—the norse started to explore lands to the west of greenland only a few years after the greenland settlements were established  in 985  while sailing from iceland to greenland with a migration fleet consisting of 400–700  and 25  other ships (14  of which completed the journey   a merchant named bjarni herjólfsson was blown off course  and after three days  sailing he sighted land west of the fleet  bjarni was only interested in finding his father s farm  but he described his discovery to leif erikson who explored the area in more detail and planted a small settlement fifteen years sagas describe three separate areas discovered during this exploration  helluland  which means  land of the flat stones   markland   the land of forests   definitely of interest to settlers in greenland where there were few trees  and vinland   the land of wine   found somewhere south of markland  it was in vinland that the settlement described in the sagas was founded three of erik the red s children visited the north american continent  his sons leif and thorvald  and their sister  or half-sister)  freydis  thorvald died there using the routes  landmarks  currents  rocks  and winds that bjarni had described to him  leif sailed some 1,800  miles to the west of the land  with a crew of 35—sailing  the same knarr bjarni had used to make the voyage  he described helluland as  level and wooded  with broad white beaches wherever they went and a gently sloping leif and others had wanted his father  erik the red  to lead this expedition and talked him into it  however  as erik attempted to join his son leif on the voyage towards these new lands  he fell off his horse as it slipped on the wet rocks near the shore  thus he was injured and stayed wintered in 1001,  probably near cape bauld on the northern tip of newfoundland  where one day his foster father tyrker was found drunk  on what the saga describes as "wine-berries."  squashberries  gooseberries  and cranberries all grew wild in the area  there are varying explanations for leif apparently describing fermented berries as  wine  leif spent another winter at  leifsbúðir  without conflict  and sailed back to brattahlíð in greenland to assume filial duties to his father in 1004,  leif s brother thorvald eiriksson sailed with a crew of 30  men to vinland and spent the following winter at leif s camp  in the spring  thorvald attacked nine of the local people who were sleeping under three skin-covered  canoes  the ninth victim escaped and soon came back to the norse camp with a force  thorvald was killed by an arrow that succeeded in passing through the barricade  although brief hostilities ensued  the norse explorers stayed another winter and left the following spring  subsequently  another of leif s brothers  thorstein  sailed to the new world to retrieve his dead brother s body  but he died before leaving 1009  thorfinn karlsefni  also known as  thorfinn the valiant   supplied three ships with livestock and 160  men and  although another source sets the number of settlers at 250).  after a cruel winter  he headed south and landed at straumfjord  he later moved to straumsöy  possibly because the current was stronger there  a sign of peaceful relations between the indigenous peoples and the norsemen is noted here  the two sides bartered with furs and gray squirrel skins for milk and red cloth  which the natives tied around their heads as a sort of headdress there are conflicting stories but one account states that a bull belonging to karlsefni came storming out of the wood  so frightening the natives that they ran to their skin-boats  and rowed away  they returned three days later  in force  the natives used catapults  hoisting  a large sphere on a pole  it was dark blue in color  and about the size of a sheep s which flew over the heads of the men and made an ugly norsemen retreated  leif erikson s half-sister  freydís eiríksdóttir was pregnant and unable to keep up with the retreating norsemen  she called out to them to stop fleeing from  such pitiful wretches   adding that if she had weapons  she could do better than that  freydís seized the sword belonging to a man who had been killed by the natives  she pulled one of her breasts out of her bodice and struck it with the sword  frightening the natives  who runestones have been found in north america  most famously the kensington runestone  these are generally considered to be hoaxes or misinterpretations of native american are many claims of norse colonization in new england  none well-founded.monuments  claimed to be norse nineteenth-century  harvard chemist eben norton horsford connected the charles river basin to places described in the norse sagas and elsewhere  notably he published several books on the topic and had plaques  monuments  and statues erected in honor of the his work received little support from mainstream historians and archeologists at the time  and even less in continental north america aimed to exploit natural resources such as furs and in particular lumber  which was in short supply in it is unclear why the short-term  settlements did not become permanent  though it was likely in part because of hostile relations with the indigenous peoples  referred to as skrælings by the nevertheless  it appears that sporadic voyages to markland for forages  timber  and trade with the locals could have lasted as long as 400  of continuing trips includes the maine penny  a norwegian coin from king olaf kyrre s reign (1067–1093)  allegedly found in a native american archaeological site in the u s  state of maine  suggesting an exchange between the norse and the native americans late in or after the 11th  century  and an entry in the icelandic annals from 1347  which refers to a small greenlandic vessel with a crew of eighteen that arrived in iceland while attempting to return to greenland from markland with a load of centuries it remained unclear whether the icelandic stories represented real voyages by the norse to north america  the sagas first gained serious historic respectability when  in 1837,  the danish antiquarian carl christian rafn pointed out the possibility for a norse settlement in  or voyages to  north america  north america  by the name winland  first appeared in written sources in a work by adam of bremen from approximately 1075.  the most important works about north america and the early norse activities there  namely the sagas of icelanders  first reached written form only in the 13th  and 14th  needed evidence of norse west of greenland came in the 1960s  when archaeologist anne stine ingstad and her husband  outdoorsman and author helge ingstad  excavated a norse settlement at l anse aux meadows in newfoundland  the location of the various lands described in the sagas remains unclear  however  many historians identify helluland with baffin island and markland with labrador  the location of vinland poses a thornier question  most believe that the l anse aux meadows settlement represents the vinland settlement described in the sagas  others argue that the sagas depict vinland as warmer than newfoundland and therefore lying farther needed in 2012  canadian researchers identified possible signs of norse outposts in nanook at tanfield valley on baffin island  as well as on nunguvik  willows island and unusual fabric cordage found on baffin island in the 1980s  and stored at the canadian museum of civilization was identified in 1999  as possibly of norse manufacture  that discovery led to more in-depth  exploration of the tanfield valley archaeological needed archeological findings in 2015  at point rosee  on the southwest coast of newfoundland  reveal evidence of the location being a bog iron-smelting  site and therefore a possible second 10th  century viking settlement in canada  the possible settlement was initially discovered through satellite imagery and magnetometer readings and archaeologists have begun excavating the skálholt map  made by an icelandic teacher in 1570,  depicts part of north-eastern  north america mentioning helluland  markland and
