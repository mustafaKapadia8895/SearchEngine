 hurricane emily was the earliest forming category 5  atlantic hurricane on record in a season and the most intense to form before august  a powerful  early season and cape verde-type  tropical cyclone that caused significant damage across the caribbean sea to mexico  the storm formed on july 10,  2005,  in the central atlantic ocean before passing through the windward islands on july 14.  tracking generally towards the west-northwest,  the storm gradually intensified as it traversed the caribbean  peaking as a category 5  hurricane on july 16,  marking the earliest date for a storm to do so during the course of a given year  the system subsequently made landfall in the yucatán peninsula as a category 4.  quickly crossing the peninsula  emily emerged into the gulf of mexico and reorganized  on july 20,  the storm struck tamaulipas as a major hurricane and rapidly dissipated within 24  hours  the storm caused significant damage along its path  with up to $1.01  billion (2005  usd  in damages recorded  as well as causing 17  fatalities on july 6,  a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa  moving westward  the disturbance gradually organized until july 10,  at which point convection became more concentrated  and it is estimated tropical depression five formed in the central tropical atlantic that late on july 11,  it strengthened and was named tropical storm emily  initially forecast to strengthen rapidly and move west-northwest  through the greater antilles  emily instead moved almost due west toward the windward islands  remaining a moderate tropical storm  the storm languished while moving quickly west  and struggled with maintaining its form  contrary to the normal occurrence that hurricanes leave a cold wake behind  hurricane dennis had made portions of the caribbean sea and therefore more favorable for tropical cyclone development  late on july 13,  emily strengthened rapidly and reached hurricane strength while passing tobago and entering the eastern caribbean  on july 14,  emily made landfall in northern grenada with 90  mph (145  km h  intensification trend picked up again the next day with a fairly rapid drop in the storm s central pressure as it entered the southeastern caribbean sea  a region typically unfavorable for intensification  hurricane emily s winds increased in reaction  briefly bringing the storm to category 4  strength early on july 15.  during the day  the storm s strength fluctuated greatly  dropping to a category 2  storm and then rebuilding to category 4.  on july 16,  emily strengthened considerably  making it the strongest hurricane ever on record to form in the month of july with peak winds of 160  mph (260  km h   the earliest known category 5  in the atlantic basin  initially at this point emily was thought to have peaked as a category 4  storm  but the post-storm  analysis showed it was indeed a category 5  the storm weakened slightly as it continued westward  and remained a category 4  while passing south of jamaica and  on july 17,  the cayman islands  hurricane emily continued on its nearly straight track to the west-northwest,  weakening somewhat but remaining at category 4  until striking cozumel just before mainland landfall at playa del carmen at 06:30  utc on july 18.  sustained winds were 135  mph (215  km h   and the eyewall passed directly over cozumel the center of circulation emerged over the gulf of mexico later that passage over land disrupted the hurricane s center of circulation  and it had weakened to a minimal hurricane with wind speeds of 75  mph (120  km h   however  several hours over the warm waters of the western gulf provided the energy needed for emily to regenerate  and by midnight wind speeds were increasing  the increase in wind speed stalled  but the storm continued to become better organized  emily started to show very symmetrical outflow  but the hurricane s strongest winds were being found at three different distances from the center  however  the outer wind radii subsided in the end  and the inner core prevailed  the result was a rapid strengthening of the inner core on the evening of july 19.  the pressure dropped about 30  millibars and the winds went from 90  mph (145  km h  to more than 125  mph (200  km h   all within a few strengthening was expected by forecasters  but did not the storm s motion slowed  and the center began wobbling erratically toward the coast  the storm made landfall around 11:00  utc on july 20  near san fernando in tamaulipas  the storm had sustained winds of 125  mph (200  km h
