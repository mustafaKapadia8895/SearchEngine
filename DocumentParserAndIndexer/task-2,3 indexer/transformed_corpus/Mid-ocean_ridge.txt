 a mid-ocean  ridge is an underwater mountain system formed by plate tectonics  it consists of various mountains linked in chains  typically having a valley known as a rift running along its spine  this type of oceanic mountain ridge is characteristic of what is known as an oceanic spreading center  which is responsible for seafloor spreading  the production of new seafloor results from mantle upwelling in response to plate spreading  this isentropic upwelling solid mantle material eventually exceeds the solidus and melts  the buoyant melt rises as magma at a linear weakness in the oceanic crust  and emerges as lava  creating new crust upon cooling  a mid-ocean  ridge demarcates the boundary between two tectonic plates  and consequently is termed a divergent plate boundary.mid-ocean  ridges are geologically active  with new magma constantly emerging onto the ocean floor and into the crust at and near rifts along the ridge axes  the crystallized magma forms new crust of basalt  known as morb for mid-ocean  ridge basalt  and below it  they are formed by two oceanic plates moving away from each other  hydrothermal vents are a common feature at oceanic spreading centers  rocks making up the crust below the seafloor are youngest along the axis of the ridge and age with increasing distance from that axis  new magma of basalt composition emerges at and near the axis because of decompression melting in the underlying earth s oceanic crust is made up of rocks much younger than the earth itself  most oceanic crust in the ocean basins is less than 200  million years old  the crust is in a constant state of  renewal  at the ocean ridges  moving away from the mid-ocean  ridge  ocean depth progressively increases  the greatest depths are in ocean trenches  as the oceanic crust moves away from the ridge axis  the peridotite in the underlying mantle cools and becomes more rigid  the crust and the relatively rigid peridotite below it make up the oceanic lithosphere slow spreading ridges like the mid-atlantic  ridge  mar  generally have large  wide rift valleys  sometimes as wide as 10–20  km (6.2–12.4  mi   and very rugged terrain at the ridge crest that can have relief of up to a 1,000  m (3,300  ft   by contrast  fast spreading ridges like the east pacific rise  epr  are narrow  sharp incisions surrounded by generally flat topography that slopes away from the ridge over many hundreds of miles the overall shape of ridges results from pratt isostacy  close to the ridge axis there is hot  low-density  mantle supporting the oceanic crust  as the oceanic plates cool  away from the ridge axes  the oceanic mantle lithosphere  the colder  denser part of the mantle that  together with the crust  comprises the oceanic plates  thickens and the density increases  thus older seafloor is underlain by denser material and  sits  lower  the width of the ridge is hence a function of spreading rate – slow ridges like the mar have spread much less far than faster ridges like the epr for the same amount of cooling and consequent bathymetric drop-off.there  are two processes  ridge-push  and slab pull  thought to be responsible for the spreading seen at mid-ocean  ridges  and there is some uncertainty as to which is dominant  ridge-push  occurs when the growing bulk of the ridge pushes the rest of the tectonic plate away from the ridge  often towards a subduction zone  at the subduction zone  "slab-pull"  comes into effect  this is simply the weight of the tectonic plate being subducted  pulled  below the overlying plate dragging the rest of the plate along behind it  the slab pull mechanism is considered to be contributing more than the ridge other process proposed to contribute to the formation of new oceanic crust at mid-ocean  ridges is the  mantle conveyor   see image   however  there have been some studies which have shown that the upper mantle  asthenosphere  is too plastic  flexible  to generate enough friction to pull the tectonic plate along  moreover  unlike in the image above  mantle upwelling that causes magma to form beneath the ocean ridges appears to involve only its upper 400  km (250  mi   as deduced from seismic tomography and from studies of the seismic discontinuity at about 400  km (250  mi   the relatively shallow depths from which the upwelling mantle rises below ridges are more consistent with the "slab-pull"  process  on the other hand  some of the world s largest tectonic plates such as the north american plate are in motion  yet are nowhere being subducted the rate at which the mid-ocean  ridge creates new material is known as the spreading rate  and is generally measured in mm yr  the common subdivisions of spreading rate are fast  medium  and slow with values generally being >100  mm yr  100–55  mm yr  and 55–20  mm yr  respectively  the spreading rate of the north atlantic ocean is   25  mm yr  while in the pacific region  it is 80–120  mm yr  ridges that spread at rates <20  mm yr are referred to as ultraslow spreading ridges  e g   the gakkel ridge in the arctic ocean and the southwest indian ridge  and they provide a much different perspective on crustal formation than their faster spreading brethren the mid-ocean  ridge systems form new oceanic crust  as crystallized basalt extruded at a ridge axis cools below curie points of appropriate iron-titanium  oxides  magnetic field directions parallel to the earth s magnetic field are recorded in those oxides  the orientations of the field in the oceanic crust preserve a record of directions of the earth s magnetic field with time  because the field has reversed directions at irregular intervals throughout its history  the pattern of geomagnetic reversals in the ocean crust can be used as an indicator of likewise  the pattern of reversals together with age measurements of the crust is used to help establish the history of the earth s magnetic field the mid-ocean  ridges of the world are connected and form the ocean ridge  a single global mid-oceanic  ridge system that is part of every ocean  making it the longest mountain range in the world  the continuous mountain range is 65,000  km (40,400  mi  long  several times longer than the andes  the longest continental mountain range   and the total length of the oceanic ridge system is 80,000  km (49,700  mi  ridges are generally submerged deep in the ocean  it was not until the 1950s,  when the ocean floor was surveyed in detail  that their full extent became known the vema  a ship of the lamont-doherty  earth observatory of columbia university  traversed the atlantic ocean  recording data about the ocean floor from the ocean surface  a team led by marie tharp and bruce heezen analyzed the data and concluded that there was an enormous mountain chain running up the middle  scientists named it the "mid-atlantic  ridge  at first  the ridge was thought to be a phenomenon specific to the atlantic ocean  however  as surveys of the ocean floor continued around the world  it was discovered that every ocean contains parts of the mid-ocean  ridge system  although the ridge system runs down the middle of the atlantic ocean  the ridge is located away from the center of other oceans alfred wegener proposed the theory of continental drift in 1912.  he stated   the mid-atlantic  ridge     zone in which the floor of the atlantic  as it keeps spreading  is continuously tearing open and making space for fresh  relatively fluid and hot sima from however  wegener did not pursue this observation in his later works and his theory was dismissed by geologists because there was no mechanism to explain how continents could plow through ocean crust  and the theory became largely forgotten following the discovery of the worldwide extent of the mid-ocean  ridge in the 1950s,  geologists faced a new task  explaining how such an enormous geological structure could have formed  in the 1960s,  geologists discovered and began to propose mechanisms for seafloor spreading  the discovery of mid-ocean  ridges and the process of seafloor spreading allowed for wegner s theory to be expanded so that it included the movement of oceanic crust as well as the plate tectonics was a suitable explanation for seafloor spreading  and the acceptance of plate tectonics by the majority of geologists resulted in a major paradigm shift in geological thinking it is estimated that 20  volcanic eruptions occur each year along earth s mid-ocean  ridges and that every year 2.5  km2  (0.97  sq mi  of new seafloor is formed by this process  with a crustal thickness of 1  to 2  km (0.62  to 1.24  mi   this amounts to about 4  km3  (0.96  cu mi  of new ocean crust formed every needed oceanic ridge and deep sea vent chemistryage of oceanic
