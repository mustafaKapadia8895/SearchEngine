 hurricane john  also known as typhoon john  was both the longest-lasting  and the farthest-traveling  tropical cyclone ever observed  john formed during the 1994  pacific hurricane season  which had above average activity due to the el niño of and peaked as a category 5  hurricane on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale  the highest categorization for hurricanes over the course of its existence  it followed a 7,165-mile  (13,280-km)  path from the eastern pacific to the western pacific and back to the central pacific  lasting 31  days in because it existed in both the eastern and western pacific  john was one of a small number of tropical cyclones to be designated as both a hurricane and a typhoon  despite lasting for a full month  john barely affected land at all  bringing only minimal effects to the hawaiian islands and the united states military base on johnston atoll  its remnants later affected alaska the origins of hurricane john were thought by the united states national hurricane center  nhc  to be from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of africa on july 25,  the wave subsequently moved across the atlantic ocean and caribbean without distinction  before it crossed central america and moved into the eastern pacific ocean on or around august upon entering the eastern pacific the wave gradually developed  before the nhc initiated advisories on the system and designated it as tropical depression ten-e  during august the system was at this time moving westwards and located around 345  miles (555  km  to the south-southeast  of acapulco  quickly developing banding features and well-defined  outflow  it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named john later that strong ridge of high pressure over the northeastern pacific ocean forced john westward  where upper level wind shear kept john a tropical storm  intensity fluctuated considerably  however  as shear levels varied  more than once  shear cleared away most of the clouds above john and nearly caused it to weaken to a tropical however  after eight days of slow westward movement across the pacific ocean  shear lessened greatly on august 19,  and john intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 1700  pdt  during an eighteen-hour  period between august 19  and august 20,  john further strengthened from a weak category 1  hurricane to a major category 3  hurricane  around 1100  pdt on august 20,  it crossed into the central pacific  the first of three basin crosses john would entering the central pacific  john left the area monitored by the nhc and was instead monitored by the central pacific hurricane center  cphc   as it moved slowly westward  hurricane john continued to strengthen considerably in an increasingly favorable environment well south of the hawaiian islands  on 22  august john was designated a category 5  hurricane on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale  the highest classification for hurricanes  and later that day  by hawaii standard time  reached its peak winds of 175  miles per hour (280  also on august 22   by hawaii standard time   john made its closest approach to the hawaiian islands  345  miles (500  km  to the south  john had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before  but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept john on its southerly path  nonetheless  heavy rains and wind from the outer bands of john affected the the hawaiian islands behind it  john began a slow turn to the north  taking near-direct  aim at johnston atoll  a small group of islands populated only by a united states military base  the storm slowly weakened from its peak as a category 5  hurricane in the face of increasing shear  dropping down to a category 1  hurricane with 90  miles per hour (145  km h  maximum winds  on august 25  local time  john made its closest approach to the johnston atoll only 15  miles (24  km  to the north  on johnston atoll  sustained winds were reported up to 60  miles per hour (95  km h   the equivalent of a strong tropical storm  and gusts up to 75  miles per hour (120  km h  were johnston atoll  john turned to the northwest and began strengthening again as shear decreased  on august 27  local time  john reached a secondary peak strength of 135  miles per hour (210  km h   and shortly thereafter it crossed the international date line at approximately 22°  n and came under the surveillance of the guam branch of the joint typhoon warning center  jtwc   by crossing into the western pacific  john also became a typhoon and was referred to as typhoon john during its time in the western immediately after crossing the date line  john again weakened and its forward motion stalled  by september 1,  john had weakened to a tropical storm and was nearly motionless just west of the date line  there  john lingered for six days while performing a multi-day  counterclockwise loop  on september 7,  a trough moved into the area and quickly moved john to the northeast  john crossed the date line again on september 8  and reentered the central reentering the central pacific  john briefly reached a tertiary peak strength of 90  miles per hour (145  km h   a strong category 1  hurricane  well to the north of midway island  however  the trough was rapidly pulling apart john s structure  and the cold waters of the northern central pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone  on september 10,  the 120th  advisory was released on the system  finally declaring john to have become extratropical approximately 1000  miles (1600  km  south of unalaska john s time in the western north pacific  the joint typhoon warning center  jtwc  had particular difficulty in forecasting and even estimating the strength of john  john weakened considerably after entering the western north pacific  and  before estimates were later revised  four consecutive advisories were issued that declared john a tropical depression  each of these advisories called for imminent dissipation  as john persisted and did not dissipate as the jtwc had predicted  it was upgraded to a minimal tropical storm in the next advisory  at the same time  however  two separate ship reports indicated that john had sustained winds of at least 55  knots (100  km h  65  mph   far stronger than the advisory strength of 35  knots (65  km h  40  mph   john would go on to restrengthen into a strong category 1  hurricane after reentering the central north pacific  defying all jtwc predictions  after later reanalysis  the jtwc raised the estimated wind speeds of john for every advisory from 1200  utc september 1  to its final advisory exactly a week later by at least 5  knots (9  km h  6  mph  and as much as 25  knots (46  km h  29  31-day  existence made john the longest-lasting  tropical cyclone recorded in both the pacific ocean and worldwide  surpassing both hurricane tina s previous record in the pacific of 24  days in the 1992  season and the 1899  san ciriaco hurricane s previous world record of 28  days in the 1899  atlantic in addition  despite its slow movement throughout much of its path  john was the farthest-traveling  tropical cyclone in both pacific ocean and worldwide  with a distance traveled of 7,165  miles (13,280  km   out-distancing  previous record holders hurricane fico in the pacific of 4,700  miles (8,700  km  in the 1978  season and hurricane faith worldwide of 6,850  miles (12,700  km  in the 1966  atlantic readings from john s peak are not consistently available as the cphc did not monitor pressures at the time  but air force reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929  mbar  hpa   making john one of the most intense hurricanes recorded in the central pacific  both hurricane emilia and hurricane gilma recorded a lower pressure in the central pacific earlier in the 1994  season  but with lower wind speeds   intensity is measured by minimum central pressure  which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds   john was also only the fourth category 5  hurricane recorded in the central pacific  the first was hurricane patsy in 1959,  the second was hurricane emilia and the third one was hurricane gilma  both earlier in 1994),  and possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central pacific hurricane  175  mph (280  since 1994,  only one category 5  hurricane  hurricane ioke  has formed in or entered into the central pacific  ioke  like emilia and gilma  had a lower central pressure but lower wind speeds than john  however  john s pressure record is incomplete  the 929  mbar reading was only measured when the winds were 160  mph  there is no pressure reading when it had winds of 175  mph  so it could have been stronger than emilia  gilma or john was the first eastern pacific hurricane to also exist as a typhoon  a feat only matched by hurricane genevieve in counting only storms recognized by all north pacific official regional specialized meteorological centers  john was only the third of five tropical cyclones to exist in all three tropical cyclone basins in the pacific ocean  the others were tropical storm georgette and hurricanes li  dora and genevieve in 1986,  earlier in 1994,  1999  and 2014,  also  john was the fifth of seven tropical cyclones to enter the central pacific from the western pacific  hurricanes patsy and skip and tropical storms virginia and carmen in 1959,  1985,  1968  and 1980,  respectively  had done so previously  and only tropical depression 17w  and tropical storm omeka in 1996  and 2010,  respectively  did so finally  john was one of only five tropical cyclones to cross the date line twice  alongside hurricanes patsy and skip  tropical storm carmen and tropical depression affected both the hawaiian islands and johnston atoll  but only lightly  while john passed over 345  miles (550  km  to the south of hawaiʻi  the islands did experience strengthened trade winds and rough surf along the southeast-  and south-facing  shores  and  while moving westward  on west-facing  shores as the waves  ranging from 6  to 10  ft (1.8  to 3.0  m  in height  flooded beach parks in additionally  heavy rains on the big island of hawaiʻi caused minor  localized flooding and some short-term  road closures  no deaths  injuries or significant damages were reported in john passed within 25  km (16  mi  of johnston atoll  it had weakened greatly to a category 1  system by closest prior to the storm s arrival  waves between 20  and 30  ft (6.1  and 9.1  m  were reported on the additionally  in the northern hemisphere  the strongest winds and heaviest rain lie to the north of a tropical cyclone  so the atoll  which lay to the south of the storm s path  was spared the brunt of the storm  nonetheless  the 1,100-man  personnel for the united states military base on johnston atoll had been evacuated to honolulu as a precaution while john approached  damage to structures was considerable  but the size of the island and relative functionality of the base led to low damage  monetary losses were estimated at close to $15  million (1994  remnants of john moved through the aleutian islands  producing a wind gust of 46  mph (74  km h  in unalaska  the storm brought a plume of warm air  and two stations recorded a high temperature of 66  °f (19
