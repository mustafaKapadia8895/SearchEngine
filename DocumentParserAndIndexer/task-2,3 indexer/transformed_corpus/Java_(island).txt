volcanoes  the highest volcano in java is mount semeru (3,676  metres (12,060  ft    the most active volcano in java and also in indonesia is mount merapi (2,930  metres (9,610  ft   more mountains and highlands help to split the interior into a series of relatively isolated regions suitable for wet-rice  cultivation  the rice lands of java are among the richest in the java was the first place where indonesian coffee was grown  starting in 1699.  today  coffea arabica is grown on the ijen plateau by small-holders  and larger plantations the area of java is approximately 150,000  square kilometres (58,000  sq it is about 1,000  km (620  mi  long and up to 210  km (130  mi  wide  the island s longest river is the 600  km long solo the river rises from its source in central java at the lawu volcano  then flows north and eastward to its mouth in the java sea near the city of surabaya  other major rivers are brantas  citarum  cimanuk and serayu the average temperature ranges from 22  °c (72  °f  to 29  °c (84  °f   average humidity is 75%.  the northern coastal plains are normally hotter  averaging 34  °c (93  °f  during the day in the dry season  the south coast is generally cooler than the north  and highland areas inland are even the wet season begins in november and ends in april  during that rain falls mostly in the afternoons and intermittently during other parts of the year  the wettest months are january and february west java is wetter than east java and mountainous regions receive much higher rainfall  the parahyangan highlands of west java receive over 4,000  millimetres (160  in  annually  while the north coast of east java receives 900  millimetres (35  in  annually the natural environment of java is tropical rainforest  with ecosystems ranging from coastal mangrove forests on the north coast  rocky coastal cliffs on the southern coast  and low-lying  tropical forests to high altitude rainforests on the slopes of mountainous volcanic regions in the interior  the javan environment and climate gradually alters from west to east  from wet and humid dense rainforest in western parts  to a dry savanna environment in the east  corresponding to the climate and rainfall in these regions originally javan wildlife supported a rich biodiversity  where numbers of endemic species of flora and fauna flourished  such as the javan javan banteng  javan warty pig  javan hawk-eagle,  javan peafowl  javan silvery gibbon  javan lutung  java mouse-deer,  javan rusa  and javan leopard  with over 450  species of birds and 37  endemic species  java is a birdwatcher s there are about 130  freshwater fish species in there are also several endemic amphibian species in java  including 5  species of tree frogs since ancient times  people have opened the rainforest  altered the ecosystem  shaped the landscapes and created rice paddy and terraces to support the growing population  javan rice terraces have existed for more than a millennium  and had supported ancient agricultural kingdoms  the growing human population has put severe pressure on java s wildlife  as rainforests were diminished and confined to highland slopes or isolated peninsulas  some of java s endemic species are now critically endangered  with some already extinct  java used to have javan tigers and javan elephants  but both have been rendered extinct  today  several national parks exist in java that protect the remnants of its fragile wildlife  such as ujung kulon  mount halimun-salak,  gede pangrango  baluran  meru betiri and alas purwo java is divided into four provinces and two special regions fossilised remains of homo erectus  popularly known as the  java man   dating back 1.7  million years were found along the banks of the bengawan solo island s exceptional fertility and rainfall allowed the development of wet-field  rice cultivation  which required sophisticated levels of cooperation between villages  out of these village alliances  small kingdoms developed  the chain of volcanic mountains and associated highlands running the length of java kept its interior regions and peoples separate and relatively before the advent of islamic states and european colonialism  the rivers provided the main means of communication  although java s many rivers are mostly short  only the brantas and sala rivers could provide long-distance  communication  and this way their valleys supported the centres of major kingdoms  a system of roads  permanent bridges and toll gates is thought to have been established in java by at least the mid-17th  century  local powers could disrupt the routes as could the wet season and road use was highly dependent on constant maintenance  subsequently  communication between java s population was taruma and sunda kingdoms of western java appeared in the 4th  and 7th  centuries respectively  while the kalingga kingdom sent embassies to china starting in however  the first major principality was the medang kingdom that was founded in central java at the beginning of the 8th  century  medang s religion centred on the hindu god shiva  and the kingdom produced some of java s earliest hindu temples on the dieng plateau  around the 8th  century the sailendra dynasty rose in kedu plain and become the patron of mahayana buddhism  this ancient kingdom built monuments such as the 9th  century borobudur and prambanan in central java around the 10th  century the centre of power shifted from central to eastern java  the eastern javanese kingdoms of kediri  singhasari and majapahit were mainly dependent on rice agriculture  yet also pursued trade within the indonesian archipelago  and with china and india majapahit was established by and by the end of the reign of hayam wuruk  r  1350–89)  it claimed sovereignty over the entire indonesian archipelago  although control was likely limited to java  bali and madura  hayam wuruk s prime minister  gajah mada  led many of the kingdom s territorial previous javanese kingdoms had their power based in agriculture  however  majapahit took control of ports and shipping lanes and became java s first commercial empire  with the death of hayam wuruk and the coming of islam to indonesia  majapahit went into became the dominant religion in java at the end of the 16th  century  during this era  the islamic kingdoms of demak  cirebon  and banten were ascendant  the mataram sultanate became the dominant power of central and eastern java at the end of the 16th  century  the principalities of surabaya and cirebon were eventually subjugated such that only mataram and banten were left to face the dutch in the 17th  century java s contact with the european colonial powers began in 1522  with a treaty between the sunda kingdom and the portuguese in malacca  after its failure the portuguese presence was confined to malacca  and to the eastern islands  in 1596,  a four-ship  expedition led by cornelis de houtman was the first dutch contact with by the end of the 18th  century the dutch had extended their influence over the sultanates of the interior through the dutch east india company in indonesia  internal conflict prevented the javanese from forming effective alliances against the dutch  remnants of the mataram survived as the surakarta  solo  and yogyakarta principalities  javanese kings claimed to rule with divine authority and the dutch helped them to preserve remnants of a javanese aristocracy by confirming them as regents or district officials within the colonial administration java s major role during the early part of the colonial period was as a producer of rice  in spice producing islands like banda  rice was regularly imported from java  to supply the deficiency in means of the napoleonic wars in europe  the netherlands fell to france  as did its colony in the east indies  during the short-lived  daendels administration  as french proxy rule on java  the construction of the java great post road was commenced in 1808.  the road  spanning from anyer in western java to panarukan in east java  served as a military supply route and was used in defending java from british 1811,  java was captured by the british  becoming a possession of the british empire  and sir stamford raffles was appointed as the island s governor  in 1814,  java was returned to the dutch under the terms of the treaty of 1815,  there may have been five million people in in the second half of the 18th  century  population spurts began in districts along the north-central  coast of java  and in the 19th  century population grew rapidly across the island  factors for the great population growth include the impact of dutch colonial rule including the imposed end to civil war in java  the increase in the area under rice cultivation  and the introduction of food plants such as casava and maize that could sustain populations that could not afford others attribute the growth to the taxation burdens and increased expansion of employment under the cultivation system to which couples responded by having more children in the hope of increasing their families  ability to pay tax and buy cholera claimed 100,000  lives in java in advent of trucks and railways where there had previously only been buffalo and carts  telegraph systems  and more coordinated distribution systems under the colonial government all contributed to famine elimination in java  and in turn  population growth  there were no significant famines in java from the 1840s  through to the japanese occupation in the however  other sources claimed the dutch s cultivation system is linked to famines and epidemics in the 1840s,  firstly in cirebon and then central java  as cash crops such as indigo and sugar had to be grown instead of rice  furthermore  the age of first marriage dropped during the 19th  century thus increasing a woman s child bearing nationalism first took hold in java in the early 20th  century  and the struggle to secure the country s independence following world war ii was centered in java  in 1949,  indonesia became independent and the island has dominated indonesian social  political and economic life  which has been the source of resentment of those residents in other islands java has been traditionally dominated by an elite class  while the people in the lower classes were often involved in agriculture and fishing  the elite class in java has evolved over the course of history  as cultural wave after cultural wave immigrated to the island  there is evidence that south asian emigres were among this elite  as well as arabian and persian immigrants during the islamic eras  more recently  chinese immigrants have also become part of the economic elite of java  although politically the chinese generally remain sidelined  there are notable exceptions  such as the governor of jakarta  basuki tjahaja purnama  though java is increasingly becoming more modern and urban  only 75%  of the island has electricity  villages and their rice paddies are still a common sight  unlike the rest of java  the population growth in central java remains low  central java however has a younger population than the national the slow population growth can in part be attributed to the choice by many people to leave the more rural central java for better opportunities and higher incomes in the bigger java s population continues to rapidly increase despite many javanese leaving the island  this is somewhat due to the fact that java is the business  academic  and cultural hub of indonesia  which attracts millions of non-javanese  people to its cities  the population growth is most intense in the regions surrounding jakarta and bandung  which is reflected through the demographic diversity in those areas with a combined population of 145  million in the 2015  census  including madura s 3.7  which is estimated for 2014  at 143.1  million  including 3.7  million for madura   java is the most populous island in the world and is home to 57%  of indonesia s at over 1,100  people per km² in 2014,  it is also one of the most densely populated parts of the world  on par with bangladesh  every region of the island has numerous volcanoes  with the people left to share the remaining flatter land  because of this  many coasts are heavily populated and cities ring around the valleys surrounding volcanic peaks the population growth rate more than doubled in economically depressed central java in the latest 2010–2015  period vs 2000–2010,  indicative of migration or other issues  there were significant volcanic eruptions during the earlier period  approximately 45%  of the population of indonesia is ethnically while sundanese make a large portion of java s population as well the western third of the island  west java  banten  and dki jakarta  has an even higher population density  of nearly 1,500  per square kilometer and accounts for the lion s share of the population growth of it is home to three metropolitan areas  greater jakarta  with outlying areas of greater serang and greater sukabumi   greater bandung  and greater cirebon.1)  other islands are included in this figure  but are very small in population and area  nusa barung 100  km²  bawean 196  km²  karimunjawa 78  km²  kambangan 121  km²  panaitan 170  km²  thousand islands 8.7

level administrations only  where not available 2014  min  estimates are used in their place from the 1970s  to the fall of the suharto regime in 1998,  the indonesian government ran transmigration programs aimed at resettling the population of java on other less-populated  islands of indonesia  this program has met with mixed results  sometimes causing conflicts between the locals and the recently arrived settlers  nevertheless  it has caused java s share of the nation s population to progressively decline jakarta and its outskirts  being the dominant metropolis  is also home to people from all over the nation  east java is also home to ethnic balinese  as well as large numbers of madurans due to their historic poverty despite its large population and in contrast to the other larger islands of indonesia  java is comparatively homogeneous in ethnic composition  only two ethnic groups are native to the island—the javanese and sundanese  a third group is the madurese  who inhabit the island of madura off the north east coast of java  and have immigrated to east java in large numbers since the 18th  the javanese comprise about two-thirds  of the island s population  while the sundanese and madurese account for 20%  and 10%  the fourth group is the betawi people that speak a dialect of malay  they are the descendants of the people living around batavia from around the 17th  century  betawis are creole people  mostly descended from various indonesian archipelago ethnic groups such as malay  sundanese  javanese  balinese  minang  bugis  makassar  ambonese  mixed with foreign ethnic groups such as portuguese  dutch  arab  chinese and indian brought to or attracted to batavia to meet labour needs  they have a culture and language distinct from the surrounding sundanese and javanese the javanese kakawin tantu pagelaran explained the mythical origin of the island and its volcanic nature  four major cultural areas exist on the island  the kejawen or javanese heartland  the north coast of the pasisir region  the sunda lands of west java  and the eastern salient  also known as blambangan  madura makes up a fifth area having close cultural ties with coastal the kejawen javanese culture is the island s most dominant  java s remaining aristocracy are based here  and it is the region from where the majority of indonesia s army  business  and political elite originate  its language  arts  and etiquette are regarded as the island s most refined and the territory from banyumas in the west through to blitar in the east and encompasses indonesia s most fertile and densely populated agricultural the southwestern part of central java  which is usually named the banyumasan region  a cultural mingling occurred  bringing together javanese culture and sundanese culture to create the banyumasan needed  in the central javanese court cities of yogyakarta and surakarta  contemporary kings trace their lineages back to the pre-colonial  islamic kingdoms that ruled the region  making those places especially strong repositories of classical javanese culture  classic arts of java include gamelan music and wayang puppet shows java was the site of many influential kingdoms in the southeast asian and as a result  many literary works have been written by javanese authors  these include ken arok and ken dedes  the story of the orphan who usurped his king  and married the queen of the ancient javanese kingdom  and translations of ramayana and mahabharata  pramoedya ananta toer is a famous contemporary indonesian author  who has written many stories based on his own experiences of having grown up in java  and takes many elements from javanese folklore and historical legends the three major languages spoken on java are javanese  sundanese and madurese  other languages spoken include betawi  a malay dialect local to the jakarta region   osing  banyumasan  and tenggerese  closely related to javanese   baduy  closely related to sundanese   kangeanese  closely related to madurese   and the vast majority of the population also speaks indonesian  often as a second language java has been a melting pot of religions and cultures  which has created a broad range of religious belief indian influences came first with shaivism and buddhism penetrating deeply into society  blending with indigenous tradition and one conduit for this were the ascetics  called resi  who taught mystical practices  a resi lived surrounded by students  who took care of their master s daily needs  resi s authorities were merely ceremonial  at the courts  brahmin clerics and pudjangga  sacred literati  legitimised rulers and linked hindu cosmology to their political small hindu enclaves are scattered throughout java  but there is a large hindu population along the eastern coast nearest bali  especially around the town of banyuwangi islam  which came after hinduism  strengthened the status structure of this traditional religious pattern  more than 90  percent of the people of java are muslims  on a broad continuum between abangan  more traditional  and santri  more modernist   the muslim scholar of the writ  kyai  became the new religious elite as hindu influences receded  islam recognises no hierarchy of religious leaders nor a formal priesthood  but the dutch colonial government established an elaborate rank order for mosque and other islamic preaching schools  in javanese pesantren  islamic schools   the kyai perpetuated the tradition of the resi  students around him provided his needs  even peasants around the hindu shrine dedicated to king siliwangi in pura parahyangan agung jagatkarta  bogor mendut vihara  a buddhist monastery near mendut temple  magelang masjid gedhe kauman in yogyakarta  build in traditional javanese multi-tiered  roof ganjuran church in bantul  built in traditional javanese architecture.pre-islamic  javan traditions have encouraged islam in a mystical direction  there emerged in java a loosely structured society of religious leadership  revolving around kyais  possessing various degrees of proficiency in pre-islamic  and islamic lore  belief and the kyais are the principal intermediaries between the villages masses and the realm of the supernatural  however  this very looseneess of kyai leadership structure has promoted schism  there were often sharp divisions between orthodox kyais  who merely instructed in islamic law  with those who taught mysticism and those who sought reformed islam with modern scientific concepts  as a result  there is a division between santri  who believe that they are more orthodox in their islamic belief and practice  with abangan  who have mixed pre-islamic  animistic and hindu-indian  concepts with a superficial acceptance of islamic are also christian communities  mostly in the larger cities  though some rural areas of south-central  java are strongly roman catholic  buddhist communities also exist in the major cities  primarily among the chinese indonesian  the indonesian constitution recognises six official religions a wider effect of this division is the number of sects  in the middle of 1956,  the department of religious affairs in yogyakarta reported 63  religious sects in java other than the official indonesian religions  of these  35  were in central java  22  in west java and six in east these include kejawen  sumarah  subud  etc  their total membership is difficult to estimate as many of their adherents identify themselves with one of the official the economy of java relied heavily on rice agriculture  ancient kingdoms such as the tarumanagara  mataram  and majapahit were dependent on rice yields and tax  java was famous for rice surpluses and rice export since ancient times  and rice agriculture contributed to the population growth of the island  trade with other parts of asia such as india and china flourished as early as the 4th  century  as evidenced by chinese ceramics found on the island dated to that period  java also took part in the global trade of maluku spice from ancient times in the majapahit era  until well into the voc era dutch east india company set their foothold on batavia in the 17th  century and was succeeded by netherlands east indies in the 19th  century  during these colonial times  the dutch introduced the cultivation of commercial plants in java  such as sugarcane  rubber  coffee  tea  and quinine  in the 19th  and early 20th  century  javanese coffee gained global popularity  thus  the name  java  today has become a synonym for coffee java is the most developed island in indonesia since the era of netherlands east indies to modern republic of indonesia  the road transportation networks that have existed since ancient times were connected and perfected with the construction of java great post road by daendels in the early 19th  century  the java great post road become the backbone of java s road infrastructure and laid the base of java north coast road  indonesian  jalan pantura  abbreviation from  pantai utara    the need to transport commercial produces such as coffee from plantations in the interior of the island to the harbour on the coast spurred the construction of railway networks in java  today the industry  business and trade  also services flourished in major cities of java  such as jakarta  surabaya  semarang  and bandung  while some traditional sultanate cities such as yogyakarta  surakarta  and cirebon preserved its royal legacy and become the centre of art  culture and tourism in java  industrial estates also growing in towns on northern coast of java  especially around cilegon  tangerang  bekasi  karawang  gresik and sidoarjo  the toll road highway networks was built and expanded since suharto era until now  connecting major urban centres and surrounding areas  such as in and around jakarta and bandung  also the ones in cirebon  semarang and surabaya  in addition to these motorways  java has 16  national highways based on the statistical data by the year of 2012  which s released by badan pusat statistik  java island itself contributes at least 57.51%  of indonesia s gross domestic product or equivalent to 504  billion us dollars
