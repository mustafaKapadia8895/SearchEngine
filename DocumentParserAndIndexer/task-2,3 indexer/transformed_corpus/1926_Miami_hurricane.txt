 the 1926  miami hurricane  commonly called the  great miami  hurricane  was a large and intense tropical cyclone that devastated the greater miami area and caused extensive damage in the bahamas and the u s  gulf coast in september 1926.  the toll for the storm was us$105  million  equivalent to $7.2  billion in as a result of the destruction in florida  the hurricane represented an early start to the great depression in the aftermath of the state s 1920s  land needed the tropical cyclone is believed to have formed in the central atlantic ocean on september 1]  steadily strengthening as it tracked west-northwestward,  the tropical storm reached hurricane intensity the next day  as a result of scattered observations at open sea  however  no ship encountered the storm until september 15,  by which time the cyclone had reached major hurricane intensity north of the virgin islands  strengthening continued up until the following day  when the storm reached peak intensity with a strength equivalent to a category 4  hurricane  this intensity was maintained as the storm tracked across the turks and caicos and the bahamas to landfall near miami on september 18.the  cyclone caused immense destruction throughout the islands and across southern florida  the storm destroyed hundreds of structures in its path over the islands  leaving thousands of residents homeless  at least 17  deaths occurred on the islands  though many others—some related only indirectly to the storm—were reported in the aftermath  upon striking south florida  the cyclone generated hurricane-force  winds over a broad swath of the region  causing widespread and severe structural damage from both wind and water  most of the deaths occurred near lake okeechobee  when a large storm surge breached muck dikes and drowned hundreds of people the hurricane quickly traversed the florida peninsula before emerging into the gulf of mexico near fort myers  the storm flooded surrounding communities and barrier islands  while strong winds downed trees and disrupted electrical service  the storm later made two landfalls with weaker intensities on alabama and mississippi on september 20  and 21,  respectively  the storm caused additional but less severe damage in those states  primarily from heavy rains and storm surge  land interaction caused the cyclone to deteriorate and later dissipate on september 22.due  to the sparseness of available observations in the central atlantic  the specific origins of the 1926  miami hurricane remain operationally  the united states weather bureau in washington  d c   did not begin issuing advisories on the cyclone until september however  the tropical cyclone is first listed in hurdat—the official atlantic hurricane database—as having begun as a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 65  miles per hour (100  km h  roughly 1,100  mi (1,770  km  east of the island of martinique in the lesser antilles on september 11.  tracking west-northwestward,  the storm gradually intensified and reached hurricane intensity on september 12  while still east of the lesser the observation of low barometric pressures and winds suggesting cyclonic rotation at saint kitts on the evening of september 14  was the first to suggest that a hurricane had the following day  the steamship matura encountered the strengthening tropical cyclone and documented a minimum pressure of 28.82  inches of mercury (976  by 06:00  utc on september 15,  the storm had strengthened further to major hurricane intensity north of the virgin continued into september 16  as the hurricane reached a strength equivalent to that of a category 4  on the modern-day  saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale  although no official minimum pressure readings were taken in the area at the time  the tropical cyclone peaked in wind-based  intensity at 18:00  utc on september 16  with sustained winds of 150  mph (241  km h   near the uppermost limit of the modern-day  ranking category with this strength the hurricane passed near the turks and caicos islands  though its intensity at the time was based on the extent of damage there as any measurement device was knocked out by the damaging shortly afterward  the cyclone struck the bahamian island of mayaguana at its peak after passing the island  the hurricane slightly weakened but maintained formidable strength as it accelerated through the southern bahamas  passing near nassau on september the storm then made a second landfall on andros island in the mangrove cay district early on september 18.  thereafter  the hurricane crossed andros island and passed over the gulf stream en route to florida  this trajectory brought the storm ashore on the coast of south florida near perrine  located just 15  mi (24  km  south of downtown miami  before 12:00  utc on september 18  with winds of 145  mph (233  km h  and a minimum pressure estimated at 930  mb (27.46  at the time  the hurricane was very large in size  with a radius of outermost closed isobar 375  miles (604  km  hurricane-force  winds were reported from the upper florida keys to near st  lucie around 20:30  utc  the eye of the hurricane passed into the gulf of mexico near punta rassa  though by that time the pressure in the eye had only risen to 28.05  inhg (950  the winds in the eye wall had decreased to 105  mph (169  km h   the hurricane had weakened over south florida as a result of land interaction  but re-strengthened  after emerging into the gulf of mexico off punta rassa six hours warm waters of the gulf of mexico allowed for the tropical cyclone to reach a secondary peak intensity with winds of 125  mph (201  km h on september 20,  equivalent to that of a modern-day  high-end  category 3  hurricane  although the storm had taken a more northwesterly course through the gulf  the hurricane later began paralleling the coast of the florida panhandle and thus slowly curved as a result  the major hurricane  now weakening quickly  made its second landfall near perdido beach  alabama  at around 21:30  utc that day with winds of 115  mph (185  after landfall  the storm quickly weakened and meandered off of alabama s barrier islands  eventually moving ashore for the last time on september 21  near gulfport  mississippi  as a tropical the cyclone continued its decay inland  degenerating into a tropical depression on the following day  before dissipating over louisiana shortly september 16,  the united states weather bureau advised caution to ships tracking in bahamian waters and the florida strait  the first tropical cyclone warning associated with the storm was a northeast storm warning issued on september 17  for the florida coast from jupiter inlet to key west  florida  warnings along the united states eastern seaboard eventually stretched as far north as charleston  south carolina  upon the storm s first landfall  additional warnings were posted for the united states gulf coast on september 19  and covered coastal areas from apalachicola  florida  to burrwood  louisiana  information on the storm as ascertained by the u s  weather bureau was relayed by various radio and local press services  though the bureau specifically acknowledged the mobile register for their efforts in disseminating storm no fatalities were reported  the hurricane wrought extensive property damage to grand turk island  rain gauges recorded 10  inches (254  mm  of rain during the storm  and high surf left knee-deep  sand drifts on the the ocean covered the land up to .75  mi (1.2  km  inland  and winds unroofed buildings at the weather station  reportedly  the winds even ripped spines from prickly pear nearly all lighters at port were the storm left 4,000  people homeless on three of the islands in the turks and due to hampered communication  the extent of damage in the bahamas was initially in the bahamas  the storm flattened hundreds of structures and killed at least 17  people  mostly on bimini  where seven people died and the greatest property damage occurred  the hurricane also leveled many structures on andros  including churches and large buildings  and downed trees and other homes on new on parts of andros  the storm snapped or felled almost all of the coconut and in the exuma district a large storm surge ruined many the storm also destroyed 60%  of the homes on the north island of bimini  left water up to 7  feet (2.1  m  deep in some areas  and was widely considered the worst storm on record in bimini to some sources say 25  people died on bimini  but these may have been indirect deaths  as many people reportedly perished after drinking contaminated well 1926  hurricane is known primarily for its impacts and lasting aftermath in south florida  particularly in the miami area  effects were concentrated around florida s southeastern coast and south-central  florida  damage figures from the storm in the state alone reached us$75  million and accounted for most of the damage that the tropical cyclone newspapers initially reported 500  killed  homes and office buildings were used to serve as refugee camps for the approximately 38,000  people displaced by the storm surge in south florida was not as high as it would have been had the hurricane struck another area  owing to the deep offshore continental shelf  which reduced the energy needed to sustain a large however  along biscayne bay  the hurricane produced a substantial storm surge  visual estimates suggested a peak height of 14–15  ft (4.3–4.6  m  in coconut and a value of 13.2  feet (4.0  m  occurred at dinner though the value was somewhat lower at 11.7  feet (3.6  m  along biscayne boulevard in downtown in fact  the storm surge measured in the 1926  hurricane was the highest ever officially documented on the east coast of south florida until observers recorded a height of 16.89  ft (5.1  m  at the burger king international headquarters near cutler in dade county during hurricane andrew in hurricane s high storm surge swept into miami and miami beach  flooding city streets with knee-deep  water  yachts and large vessels were carried by the intense wind and waves onto the macarthur causeway connecting miami and miami beach was submerged under 6  ft (1.8  m  of water  and communication between the two locales as well as the rest of the united states was cut after all local telecommunications and power lines were blown due to their susceptibility to strong winds  most wooden buildings in miami were either blown down or lost their roofs  concrete and steel buildings were warped at their while skyscrapers mostly sustained minor damage  the 18-story  meyer-kiser  building bore considerable the structure reportedly swayed and vibrated precipitously during the storm  eyewitnesses likened it to the charleston many of the injuries in the city were due to ballistic fragments of broken roofing including iron sheeting other structures across the region sustained significant damage  strong winds leveled  hundreds  of working-class  homes in hialeah and severely damaged 70%  of the winds destroyed the interiors of buildings in fort lauderdale  the seat of broward county  and ripped the roof from the broward county courthouse  despite having only 12,000  inhabitants  the town sustained severe damage to 3,500  of its nearby  the storm severely damaged the abandoned new river house of on hollywood beach  waves smashed windows and invaded the interior of the hollywood beach hotel  people on the second floor found sand drifts reaching  half way to the the storm also ravaged entertainment venues  the storm flattened the fulford–miami speedway in north miami beach  which then ceased winds peeled into pieces the roof of the grandstand at hialeah race track and destroyed the kennels  allowing racing greyhounds to the storm wrecked prominent restaurants and tourist attractions on miami beach  including the million dollar many historic structures throughout south florida sustained significant damage  including the barnacle and the villa the storm damaged the main residence at the bonnet house—the only hurricane to do so since it was first no other storm since 1926  caused a similar level of destruction to the property until hurricane wilma in as far north as lake park  then called kelsey city  and west palm beach in palm beach county reported many roofs blown off  numerous small buildings destroyed  walls blown down  windows shattered  and trees  shrubs  and other objects torn apart or the worst destruction occurred in the poorer  mostly black sections of the towns  where many homes were the waters of the lake worth lagoon overflowed their banks  submerging nearby streets  parks  and golf high tides piled debris on the streets of palm beach  caused a beachfront boardwalk to collapse  and exacerbated previous damage from the july the east coast of south florida  the storm caused widespread  significant beach at hillsboro inlet light  high tides removed 20  feet (6.1  m  of sand beneath the the hurricane swept away much of state road a1a  in broward and miami-dade  the combined force of waves and storm surge undermined coastal structures that collapsed  including multi-story  casinos on miami and washed out the coastal bridge on florida state road a1a  at baker s haulover in boca raton  waves were so large that they rose to the top of the high ridge on the barrier island  though they did not overtop high surf also destroyed a casino at the boca raton inlet  "knee-deep"  water east of u s  route 1   federal highway  in boca raton blocked beach access  but residents waded meanwhile  large waves left much debris and sand drifts several feet deep on state road a1a  in delray storm ravaged cultivated areas throughout south florida  the storm flooded the surrounding citrus crop and agricultural fields south of miami  particularly near homestead and florida destroying half of the citrus-bearing  trees in the much of the citrus crop in dania was a total loss as floodwaters submerged the area to depths of 6  ft (1.8  m   flooding lingered for more than a week after the storm surge from lake okeechobee entirely inundated clewiston  reportedly leaving numerous bodies along the road connecting the city with miami  further inland  the surge burst through frail  earthen  6-foot  (1.8  m  tall muck submerging moore haven under 13–15  ft (4.0–4.6  m  of water  residents scrambled  often unsuccessfully  to safety on rooftops but were swept away by the winds and storm a nearby drainage dam was destroyed  causing additional flooding of the countryside  most of the city s buildings were swept off of their original reports by the red cross and local authorities indicated that 150  human corpses were found in moore haven their estimates were incomplete as many bodies were never found  reportedly having been swept deep into the everglades  estimates of the dead near lake okeechobee ranged as high as two years later  another category 4  hurricane killed at least 2,500  people along lake okeechobee  but mostly affected the eastern shore  leaving moore haven largely gulf coast of the florida peninsula saw comparatively less damage compared to greater miami but still suffered significant impacts  a peak storm tide of 11  to 12  ft (3.4  to 3.7  m  affected punta rassa and the islands of captiva and sanibel  causing $3,000,000  in flood the storm opened redfish pass between captiva and north captiva between tampa and naples  strong winds destroyed windows and felled trees and power in fort myers  citrus crops sustained some damage and public utilities were put out of commission  strong winds uprooted trees in st  petersburg  while heavy rainfall caused flooding in the outlying districts of nearby south of the eye  a storm tide of 8  ft (2.4  m  submerged the streets of everglades city  forcing people into the upper stories of buildings  homes that were not secured to their foundations floated away on the tides reached 4  to 5  ft (1.2  to 1.5  m  as far south as flamingo  sending seaweed  fish  and mud into the hurricane weakened before striking the upper gulf coast  its slow movement produced substantial effects to coastal regions between mobile and pensacola  these areas experienced heavy damage from wind  rain  and storm wind records at pensacola indicate that the city encountered sustained winds of hurricane force for more than 20  hours  including winds above 100  mph (161  km h  for five hours   the storm tide destroyed nearly all waterfront structures on pensacola bay and peaked at 14  ft (4.3  m  near bagdad  rainfall maximized at bay minette  alabama  where 18.5  inches (470  mm  disarray in miami following the hurricane s passage led a breakout of looting in the city s african american districts that resulted in seven arrests  this unrest prompted the declaration of martial law with the swearing-in  of 300  special policemen for voluntary duty  similarly  200  policemen were placed on duty in hollywood  florida  after a survey indicated that the available food and water supplies would only last 30  days  hoarding was soup kitchens were set up in miami s business district in order to serve food to the recently displaced and as a source for clean drinking water that was contaminated in other areas  the first aid arriving from outside the impacted areas was a relief train guarded by state militiamen that carted medical staff  medicine  potable water  and other relief supplies into miami immediately following the storm s afterwards  then-u.s.  president calvin coolidge placed the united states army and coast guard on standby should relief efforts necessitate their presence in florida and the the red cross offered its facilities and the pullman company offered its resources for use in relief efforts  the national guard of the united states dispatched several companies of guardsmen to disaster areas following urgent appeals from then-florida  governor john w  in response to the widespread destruction of buildings on miami beach  john j  farrey was appointed chief building  plumbing and electrical inspector  he initiated and enforced the first building code in the united states  which more than 5,000  us cities to the american red cross  the storm caused 372  fatalities  including 114  from the city of miami  but these totals apparently do not include deaths outside the united prior to 2003,  the national weather service had long accepted 243  as the number of deaths  but historical research indicated that this total was far too low  the nws then updated its totals to reflect the new even the estimates for the united states are uncertain and vary  since there were many people  especially transients and colored migrants in south florida  listed as  missing   about 43,000  people were left homeless  mostly in the miami area the university of miami  located in coral gables  had been founded in 1925  and opened its doors for the first time just days after the hurricane passed  the university s athletic teams were nicknamed the hurricanes in memory of this catastrophe  the school s mascot is sebastian  an ibis  the ibis is a small white bird that can be seen around south florida  including on the um campus  an ibis was selected to represent the hurricanes because of folklore in which it is typically the last bird to leave before a hurricane strikes and the first to return once it s events  including the sinking of a ship in the miami harbor and an embargo by the florida east coast railroad before the storm  weakened the florida land boom of the 1920s  in south florida  however  the storm is considered the final blow to end the boom locally  thousands of newcomers to florida left the state and cleared their bank accounts  leaving many banks to the brink of as a result  the great depression of 1929  did not make a great impact to florida unlike the rest of the many planned developments  which had fallen into deadlock due to insufficient resources  were abandoned due to the economic effects of the hurricane  in boca raton  for instance  one planned community by addison mizner  called villa rica  was destroyed by the hurricane and never south florida did not achieve full economic recovery until
