 this is a list of costliest atlantic hurricanes  hurricanes  as defined by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa   are tropical cyclones—a warm-core,  non-frontal  synoptic-scale  cyclone  originating over tropical or subtropical waters with organized deep convection and a closed surface wind circulation about a well-defined  center—in the atlantic  caribbean sea  gulf of mexico  or eastern pacific  in which the maximum 1-minute  sustained surface wind exceeds 64  knots (74  mph  119  km h  or greater  the hurricanes on the list below depict the severity of the damage the system has caused  typically  if a hurricane has caused significant damage to a particular location  its name is retired so that it will not be re-used  as a name for any future hurricanes  the costliest tropical cyclone ever recorded was hurricane harvey  which caused catastrophic flooding in southeastern texas  in august 2017,  causing $198.6  billion (2017  usd  in property damage  the costliest season on record was 2017,  with damage estimated in excess of $300  billion a majority of the costliest atlantic hurricanes in recorded history have peaked as major hurricanes  however  weaker tropical cyclones can still cause widespread damage  both tropical storms allison in 2001  and lee in 2011  have caused over a billion in damage  the former of which accounted for a higher damage total  due to their excessive damage  the names of tropical cyclones accruing at least $1  billion in damage are often retired by the world meteorological organization  however  this is not always the case  hurricane juan in 1985  was the first hurricane to cause at least a billion in damage and not be retired  its name was retired on a later usage in 2003  that did not cause over a billion in damage  since juan  seven tropical cyclones that caused at least a billion in damage were not retired  including hurricane emily in 2005,  and the most recent of which being hurricane isaac in 2012.  all other 47  atlantic hurricanes to have caused as much damage have had their names retired  excluding recent hurricanes harvey  irma  maria  and ophelia of the 2017  season the first hurricane to cause at least $1  billion in damage was hurricane betsy in 1965,  which caused much of its damage in southeastern louisiana  between two and four years later  hurricanes beulah and camille both caused at least $1  billion in damage  after the 1960s,  each decade saw an increase in tropical cyclones causing at least a billion in damage over the last  due to increasing urban development and population  in the 1970s,  four hurricanes caused at least a billion in damage  the costliest of which was hurricane frederic  which caused $2.3  billion in damage  particularly in mississippi and alabama  the following decade featured seven hurricanes causing at least a billion in damage  in the 1989  season  hurricane hugo was the first storm to hit $10  billion u s  dollars in cost  in the 1990s,  nine tropical cyclones accrued at least a billion in damage  hurricane andrew in 1992  greatly exceeded the damage figure of any preceding tropical cyclone after causing $26.5  billion in damage  mostly in south florida  seventeen tropical cyclones in the 2000s  caused at least $1  billion in damage  the 2005  season had six billion-dollar  hurricanes  the most of any season on record  hurricane ivan caused at least $1  billion in damage in four separate countries  and according to estimates  hurricane irma caused at least $1  billion in damage in five separate countries  thus far in the 2010s,  eleven storms have caused at least $1  billion in damage  with the costliest so far being hurricane harvey which caused $198.6  billion in damage this list ranks tropical cyclones within the atlantic that have accrued at least us$1  billion in damage  based on their nominal usd damage totals  because these numbers have not been adjusted for inflation  nor adjusted for changes in population and wealth in coastal counties  the costliness of recent hurricanes is artificially inflated compared to hurricanes of the past  this makes it hard to accurately compare the damage inflicted by hurricanes across time hurricanes irma  maria  and ophelia are not included in this list yet as final damage costs are not determined yet  preliminary estimates for irma place the cost of the storm between $50  and $112  preliminary estimates for maria put the cost of the storm at $15.9  billion to $95  preliminary estimates for ophelia put the cost of the storm at $2.1
