 latvia  lithuania  germany  poland and as well as southern italy the old frankish word nortmann  northman  was latinised as normanni and then entered old french as normands  whence the name of the normans and of normandy  which was settled by norsemen in the 10th  the early medieval period  as today  vikings was a common term for attacking needed  especially in connection with raids and monastic plundering by norsemen in the british isles and ireland  the norse were also known as ascomanni  ashmen  by the lochlanach  norse  by the gaels and dene  danes  by the anglo-saxons.the

also known as lochlannaigh  or lake-people.in  the 8th  century the inrush of the vikings in force began to be felt all over pictland  these vikings were pagans and savages of the most unrestrained and pitiless type  they were composed of finn-gall  or norwegians  and of dubh-gall  or danes  the latter were a mixed breed  with a hunnish strain in british conceptions of the vikings  origins were not quite correct  those who plundered britain lived in what is today denmark  scania  the western coast of sweden and norway  up to almost the 70th  parallel  and along the swedish baltic coast up to around the 60th  latitude and lake mälaren  they also settled on the island of gotland  the border between the norsemen and more southerly germanic tribes  the danevirke  today is located about 50  kilometres (31  mi  south of the danish-german  border  the southernmost living vikings lived no further north than newcastle upon tyne  and travelled to britain more from the east than from the north

large areas of norway  finland and the kola peninsula in today s russia the slavs  the arabs and the byzantines knew them as the rus  or rhōs  probably derived from various uses of rōþs-,  i e   related to rowing   or from the area of roslagen in east-central  sweden  where most of the vikings who visited the slavic lands originated  archaeologists and historians of today believe that these scandinavian settlements in the slavic lands formed the names of the countries of russia and belarus the slavs and the byzantines also called them varangians  on  væringjar  meaning  sworn men    and the scandinavian bodyguards of the byzantine emperors were known as the varangian guard in the old norse language  the term norrœnir menn  northern men   was used correspondingly to the modern english
