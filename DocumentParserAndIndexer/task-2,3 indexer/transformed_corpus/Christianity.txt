population  known as 2]  christians make up a majority of the population in 158  countries and they believe that jesus is the son of god and the savior of humanity whose coming as the messiah  the christ  was prophesied in the old christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of western grew out of and began as a second temple judaic sect in the mid-1st  originating in the roman province of judea  it quickly spread to europe  syria  mesopotamia  asia minor  transcaucasia  egypt  ethiopia and the indian subcontinent  and by the end of the 4th  century had become the official state church of the roman following the age of discovery  christianity spread to the americas  oceania  sub-saharan  africa and the rest of the world through missionary work and theology is summarized in creeds such as the apostles  creed and the nicene creed  these professions of faith state that jesus suffered  died  was buried  descended into hell  and rose from the dead  in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust in him for the remission of their sins  the creeds further maintain that jesus physically ascended into heaven  where he reigns with god the father in the unity of the holy spirit  and that he will return to judge the living and the dead and grant eternal life to his followers  his incarnation  earthly ministry  crucifixion and resurrection are often referred to as  the gospel   meaning  good 3]  the term gospel also refers to written accounts of jesus  life and teaching  four of which—matthew  mark  luke  and john—are considered canonical and included in the christian bible  as established by the 5th  for the ancient undivided catholic and eastern orthodox traditions before the east–west schism throughout its history  christianity has weathered schisms and theological disputes that have resulted in many distinct churches and denominations  worldwide  the largest branches of christianity are the catholic church  the eastern orthodox church  oriental orthodoxy  as well as thousands of denominations and congregations of protestantism  the latter due to fundamentally different ecclesiology  the catholic and eastern orthodox churches broke communion with each other in the east–west schism of 1054.  protestantism came into existence in the protestant reformation in the 16th  century  splitting from the catholic are many important differences of interpretation and opinion of the bible and sacred tradition on which christianity is because of these irreconcilable differences in theology and a lack of consensus on the core tenets of christianity  catholics  protestants and orthodox often deny that members of certain other branches are doctrinal statements or confessions of religious beliefs are known as creeds  from latin credo  meaning  i believe    they began as baptismal formulae and were later expanded during the christological controversies of the 4th  and 5th  centuries to become statements of faith many evangelical protestants reject creeds as definitive statements of faith  even while agreeing with some or all of the substance of the creeds  the baptists have been non-creedal   in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one also rejecting creeds are groups with roots in the restoration movement  such as the christian church  disciples of christ   the evangelical christian church in canada and the churches of apostles  creed is the most widely accepted statement of the articles of christian faith  it is used by a number of christian denominations for both liturgical and catechetical purposes  most visibly by liturgical churches of western christian tradition  including the latin church of the catholic church  lutheranism  anglicanism and western rite orthodoxy  it is also used by presbyterians  methodists and congregationalists  this particular creed was developed between the 2nd  and 9th  centuries  its central doctrines are those of the trinity and god the creator  each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the apostolic period  the creed was apparently used as a summary of christian doctrine for baptismal candidates in the churches of main points include the nicene creed was formulated  largely in response to arianism  at the councils of nicaea and constantinople in 325  and 381  respectively and ratified as the universal creed of christendom by the first council of ephesus in chalcedonian definition  or creed of chalcedon  developed at the council of chalcedon in though rejected by the oriental orthodox taught christ  to be acknowledged in two natures  inconfusedly  unchangeably  indivisibly  inseparably   one divine and one human  and that both natures  while perfect in themselves  are nevertheless also perfectly united into one athanasian creed  received in the western church as having the same status as the nicene and chalcedonian  says   we worship one god in trinity  and trinity in unity  neither confounding the persons nor dividing the christians  roman catholic  eastern orthodox  oriental orthodox and protestant alike  accept the use of creeds  and subscribe to at least one of the creeds mentioned central tenet of christianity is the belief in jesus as the son of god and the messiah  christ   christians believe that jesus  as the messiah  was anointed by god as savior of humanity  and hold that jesus  coming was the fulfillment of messianic prophecies of the old testament  the christian concept of the messiah differs significantly from the contemporary jewish concept  the core christian belief is that through belief in and acceptance of the death and resurrection of jesus  sinful humans can be reconciled to god and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal there have been many theological disputes over the nature of jesus over the earliest centuries of christian history  generally christians believe that jesus is god incarnate and  true god and true man   or both fully divine and fully human   jesus  having become fully human  suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man  but did not sin  as fully god  he rose to life again  according to the new testament  he rose from the ascended to heaven  is seated at the right hand of the and will ultimately 1:9–11]  to fulfill the rest of messianic prophecy  including the resurrection of the dead  the last judgment and final establishment of the kingdom of god according to the canonical gospels of matthew and luke  jesus was conceived by the holy spirit and born from the virgin mary  little of jesus  childhood is recorded in the canonical gospels  although infancy gospels were popular in antiquity  in comparison  his adulthood  especially the week before his death  is well documented in the gospels contained within the new testament  because that part of his life is believed to be most important  the biblical accounts of jesus  ministry include  his baptism  miracles  preaching  teaching and deeds christians consider the resurrection of jesus to be the cornerstone of their faith  see 1  corinthians 15)  and the most important event in among christian beliefs  the death and resurrection of jesus are two core events on which much of christian doctrine and theology is according to the new testament  jesus was crucified  died a physical death  was buried within a tomb and rose from the dead three days 19:30–31]  16:1]  new testament mentions several resurrection appearances of jesus on different occasions to his twelve apostles and disciples  including  more than five hundred brethren at 15:6]  before jesus  ascension to heaven  jesus  death and resurrection are commemorated by christians in all worship services  with special emphasis during holy week which includes good friday and easter sunday the death and resurrection of jesus are usually considered the most important events in christian theology  partly because they demonstrate that jesus has power over life and death and therefore has the authority and power to give people eternal churches accept and teach the new testament account of the resurrection of jesus with very few some modern scholars use the belief of jesus  followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the historical jesus and the proclamation of the early some liberal christians do not accept a literal bodily seeing the story as richly symbolic and spiritually nourishing myth  arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious debates and interfaith paul the apostle  an early christian convert and missionary  wrote   if christ was not raised  then all our preaching is useless  and your trust in god is 15:14]  the apostle  like jews and roman pagans of his time  believed that sacrifice can bring about new kinship ties  purity and eternal for paul  the necessary sacrifice was the death of jesus  gentiles who are  christ s  are  like israel  descendants of abraham and  heirs according to the 3:29]  the god who raised jesus from the dead would also give new life to the  mortal bodies  of gentile christians  who had become with israel the  children of god  and were therefore no longer  in the 8:9,11,16]  christian churches tend to be much more concerned with how humanity can be saved from a universal condition of sin and death than the question of how both jews and gentiles can be in god s family  according to both catholic and protestant doctrine  salvation comes by jesus  substitutionary death and resurrection  the catholic church teaches that salvation does not occur without faithfulness on the part of christians  converts must live in accordance with principles of love and ordinarily must be martin luther taught that baptism was necessary for salvation  but modern lutherans and other protestants tend to teach that salvation is a gift that comes to an individual by god s grace  sometimes defined as  unmerited favor   even apart from baptism christians differ in their views on the extent to which individuals  salvation is pre-ordained  by god  reformed theology places distinctive emphasis on grace by teaching that individuals are completely incapable of self-redemption,  but that sanctifying grace is in contrast catholics  orthodox christians and arminian protestants believe that the exercise of free will is necessary to have faith in refers to the teaching that the one comprises three distinct  eternally co-existing  persons  the father  the son  incarnate in jesus christ  and the holy spirit  together  these three persons are sometimes called the although there is no single term in use in scripture to denote the unified in the words of the athanasian creed  an early statement of christian belief   the father is god  the son is god and the holy spirit is god  and yet there are not three gods but one they are distinct from another  the father has no source  the son is begotten of the father and the spirit proceeds from the father  though distinct  the three persons cannot be divided from one another in being or in operation  while some christians also believe that god appeared as the father in the old testament  it is agreed that he appeared as the son in the new testament  and will still continue to manifest as the holy spirit in the present  but still  god still existed as three persons in each of these however  traditionally there is a belief that it was the son who appeared in the old testament because  for example  when the trinity is depicted in art  the son typically has the distinctive appearance  a cruciform halo identifying christ  and in depictions of the garden of eden this looks forward to an incarnation yet to occur  in some early christian sarcophagi the logos is distinguished with a beard   which allows him to appear ancient  even trinity is an essential doctrine of mainstream christianity  from earlier than the times of the nicene creed  325,  christianity the triune mystery-nature  of god as a normative profession of faith  according to roger e  olson and christopher hall  through prayer  meditation  study and practice  the christian community concluded  that god must exist as both a unity and trinity   codifying this in ecumenical council at the end of the 4th  to this doctrine  god is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole  rather  each person is considered to be fully god  see perichoresis   the distinction lies in their relations  the father being unbegotten  the son being begotten of the father  and the holy spirit proceeding from the father and  in western christian theology  from the son  regardless of this apparent difference  the three  persons  are each eternal and omnipotent  other christian religions including unitarian universalism  jehovah s witnesses  mormonism and others do not share those views on the trinity the latin word trias  from which trinity is derived  is first seen in the works of theophilus of antioch  he wrote of  the trinity of god  the father   his word  the son  and his wisdom  holy the term may have been in use before this time  afterwards it appears in in the following century the word was in general use  it is found in many passages of denotes those christians who believe in the concept of the trinity  almost all christian denominations and churches hold trinitarian beliefs  although the words  trinity  and  triune  do not appear in the bible  theologians beginning in the 3rd  century developed the term and concept to facilitate comprehension of the new testament teachings of god as being father  son and holy spirit  since that time  christian theologians have been careful to emphasize that trinity does not imply that there are three gods  the antitrinitarian heresy of tritheism   nor that each hypostasis of the trinity is one-third  of an infinite god  partialism   nor that the son and the holy spirit are beings created by and subordinate to the father  arianism   rather  the trinity is defined as one god in three  or antitrinitarianism  refers to theology that rejects the doctrine of the trinity  various nontrinitarian views  such as adoptionism or modalism  existed in early christianity  leading to the disputes about nontrinitarianism later appeared again in the gnosticism of the cathars in the 11th  through 13th  centuries  among groups with unitarian theology in the protestant reformation of the 16th  in the 18th-century  enlightenment and in some groups arising during the second great awakening of the 19th  century christianity  like other religions  has adherents whose beliefs and biblical interpretations vary  christianity regards the biblical canon  the old testament and the new testament  as the inspired word of god  the traditional view of inspiration is that god worked through human authors so that what they produced was what god wished to communicate  the greek word referring to inspiration in 2  timothy 3:16  is theopneustos  which literally means believe that divine inspiration makes our present bibles inerrant  others claim inerrancy for the bible in its original manuscripts  although none of those are extant  still others maintain that only a particular translation is inerrant  such as the king james another closely related view is biblical infallibility or limited inerrancy  which affirms that the bible is free of error as a guide to salvation  but may include errors on matters such as history  geography or science the books of the bible accepted by the orthodox  catholic and protestant churches vary somewhat  with jews accepting only the hebrew bible as canonical  there is however substantial overlap  these variations are a reflection of the range of traditions  and of the councils that have convened on the subject  every version of the old testament always includes the books of the tanakh  the canon of the hebrew bible  the catholic and orthodox canons  in addition to the tanakh  also include the deuterocanonical books as part of the old testament  these books appear in the septuagint  but are regarded by protestants to be apocryphal  however  they are considered to be important historical documents which help to inform the understanding of words  grammar and syntax used in the historical period of their conception  some versions of the bible include a separate apocrypha section between the old testament and the new the new testament  originally written in koine greek  contains 27  books which are agreed upon by all churches modern scholarship has raised many issues with the bible  while the authorized king james version is held to by many because of its striking english prose  in fact it was translated from the erasmus greek bible which in turn  was based on a single 12th  century manuscript that is one of the worst manuscripts we have available to much scholarship in the past several hundred years has gone into comparing different manuscripts in order to reconstruct the original text  another issue is that several books are considered to be forgeries  the injunction that women  be silent and submissive  in 1  timothy is thought by many to be a forgery by a follower of paul  a similar phrase in 1  corinthians which is thought to be by paul  appears in different places in different manuscripts and is thought to originally be a margin note by a other verses in 1  corinthians  such as 1  corinthians 11:2–16  where women are instructed to wear a covering over their hair  when they pray or contradict this verse a final issue with the bible is the way in which books were selected for inclusion in the new testament  other gospels have now been recovered  such as those found near nag hammadi in 1945,  and while some of these texts are quite different from what christians have been used to  it should be understood that some of this newly recovered gospel material is quite possibly contemporaneous with  or even earlier than  the new testament gospels  the core of the gospel of thomas  in particular  may date from as early as ad 50   although some major scholars contest this early and if so would provide an insight into the earliest gospel texts that underlie the canonical gospels  texts that are mentioned in luke 1:1–2.  the gospel of thomas contains much that is familiar from the canonical gospels—verse 113,  for example   the father s kingdom is spread out upon the earth  but people do not see is reminiscent of luke the gospel of john  with a terminology and approach that is suggestive of what was later termed gnosticism  has recently been seen as a possible response to the gospel of thomas  a text that is commonly labelled proto-gnostic.  scholarship  then  is currently exploring the relationship in the early church between mystical speculation and experience on the one hand and the search for church order on the other  by analyzing new-found  texts  by subjecting canonical texts to further scrutiny  and by an examination of the passage of new testament texts to canonical status in antiquity  two schools of exegesis developed in alexandria and antioch  alexandrine interpretation  exemplified by origen  tended to read scripture allegorically  while antiochene interpretation adhered to the literal sense  holding that other meanings  called theoria  could only be accepted if based on the literal theology distinguishes two senses of scripture  the literal and the literal sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of scripture  the spiritual sense is further subdivided into regarding exegesis  following the rules of sound interpretation  catholic theology holds some protestant interpreters make use of end of things  whether the end of an individual life  the end of the age  or the end of the world  broadly speaking is christian eschatology  the study of the destiny of humans as it is revealed in the bible  the major issues in christian eschatology are the tribulation  death and the afterlife  the rapture  the second coming of jesus  resurrection of the dead  heaven and hell  millennialism  the last judgment  the end of the world and the new heavens and new earth christians believe that the second coming of christ will occur at the end of time after a period of severe persecution  the great tribulation   all who have died will be resurrected bodily from the dead for the last judgment  jesus will fully establish the kingdom of god in fulfillment of scriptural christians believe that human beings experience divine judgment and are rewarded either with eternal life or eternal damnation  this includes the general judgement at the resurrection of the dead as well as the belief  held by roman and most protestants  in a judgment particular to the individual soul upon physical death in roman catholicism  those who die in a state of grace  i e   without any mortal sin separating them from god  but are still imperfectly purified from the effects of sin  undergo purification through the intermediate state of purgatory to achieve the holiness necessary for entrance into god s those who have attained this goal are called saints  latin sanctus  christian groups  such as seventh-day  adventists  hold to mortalism  the belief that the human soul is not naturally immortal  and is unconscious during the intermediate state between bodily death and resurrection  these christians also hold to annihilationism  the belief that subsequent to the final judgement  the wicked will cease to exist rather than suffer everlasting torment  jehovah s witnesses hold to a similar martyr described 2nd-century  christian liturgy in his first apology  c  150)  to emperor antoninus pius  and his description remains relevant to the basic structure of christian liturgical worship and on the day called sunday  all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place  and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read  as long as time permits  then  when the reader has ceased  the president verbally instructs  and exhorts to the imitation of these good things  then we all rise together and pray  and  as we before said  when our prayer is ended  bread and wine and water are brought  and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings  according to his ability  and the people assent  saying amen  and there is a distribution to each  and a participation of that over which thanks have been given  and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons  and they who are well to do  and willing  give what each thinks fit  and what is collected is deposited with the president  who succours the orphans and widows and those who  through sickness or any other cause  are in want  and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us  and in a word takes care of all who are in as justin described  christians assemble for communal worship on sunday  the day of the resurrection  though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting  scripture readings are drawn from the old and new testaments  but especially the gospel accounts  often these are arranged on an annual cycle  using a book called a lectionary  instruction is given based on these readings  called a sermon  or homily  there are a variety of congregational prayers  including thanksgiving  confession and intercession  which occur throughout the service and take a variety of forms including recited  responsive  silent  or sung  the lord s prayer  or our father  is regularly prayed some groups depart from this traditional liturgical structure  a division is often made between  high  church services  characterized by greater solemnity and ritual  and  low  services  but even within these two categories there is great diversity in forms of worship  seventh-day  adventists meet on saturday  while others do not meet on a weekly basis  charismatic or pentecostal congregations may spontaneously feel led by the holy spirit to action rather than follow a formal order of service  including spontaneous prayer  quakers sit quietly until moved by the holy spirit to speak some evangelical services resemble concerts with rock and pop music  dancing and use of multimedia  for groups which do not recognize a priesthood distinct from ordinary believers the services are generally led by a minister  preacher  or pastor  still others may lack any formal leaders  either in principle or by local necessity  some churches use only a cappella music  either on principle  for example  many churches of christ object to the use of instruments in worship  or by tradition  as in orthodoxy  nearly all forms of churchmanship celebrate the eucharist  holy communion   which consists of a consecrated meal  it is reenacted in accordance with jesus  instruction at the last supper that his followers do in remembrance of him as when he gave his disciples bread  saying   this is my body   and gave them wine saying   this is my some christian denominations practice closed communion  they offer communion to those who are already united in that denomination or sometimes individual church  catholics restrict participation to their members who are not in a state of mortal sin  most other churches practice open communion since they view communion as a means to unity  rather than an end  and invite all believing christians to participate worship can be varied for special events like baptisms or weddings in the service or significant feast days  in the early church  christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the eucharistic part of the worship  in many churches today  adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate  teaching  such children s worship is often called sunday school or sabbath school  sunday schools are often held before rather than during services  in christian belief and practice  a sacrament is a rite  instituted by christ  that confers grace  constituting a sacred mystery  the term is derived from the latin word sacramentum  which was used to translate the greek word for mystery  views concerning both which rites are sacramental  and what it means for an act to be a sacrament  vary among christian denominations and most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign  instituted by christ  that conveys an inward  spiritual grace through christ  the two most widely accepted sacraments are baptism and the eucharist  or holy communion   however  the majority of christians also recognize five additional sacraments  confirmation  chrismation in the orthodox tradition   holy orders  ordination   penance  or confession   anointing of the sick and matrimony  see christian views on together  these are the seven sacraments as recognized by churches in the high church tradition—notably roman catholic  eastern orthodox  oriental orthodox  independent catholic  old catholic  many anglicans and some lutherans  most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only baptism and eucharist as sacraments  while some protestant groups  such as the quakers  reject sacramental christian denominations  such as baptists  which believe these rites do not communicate grace  prefer to call baptism and holy communion ordinances rather than sacraments in addition to this  the church of the east has two additional sacraments in place of the traditional sacraments of matrimony and the anointing of the sick  these include holy leaven  melka  and the sign of the specifically infant baptism  in the lutheran traditiona penitent confessing

and traditional protestant communities frame worship around the liturgical year  the liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of seasons  each with their theological emphases  and modes of prayer  which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches  colours of paraments and vestments for scriptural readings  themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home western christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the roman rite of the catholic and eastern christians use analogous calendars based on the cycle of their respective rites  calendars set aside holy days  such as solemnities which commemorate an event in the life of jesus  mary or the saints  and periods of fasting  such as lent and other pious events such as memoria or lesser festivals commemorating saints  christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations  such as christmas  easter and pentecost  these are the celebrations of christ s birth  resurrection and the descent of the holy spirit upon the church  respectively  a few denominations make no use of a liturgical has not generally practiced aniconism  or the avoidance or prohibition of types of images  even if the early jewish christians sects  as well as some modern denominations  preferred to some extent not to use figures in their symbols  by invoking the decalogue s prohibition of idolatry the cross  which is today one of the most widely recognized symbols in the world  was used as a christian symbol from the earliest tertullian  in his book de corona  tells how it was already a tradition for christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the although the cross was known to the early christians  the crucifix did not appear in use until the 5th  the symbols employed by the primitive christians  that of the fish or ichthys seems to have ranked first in importance  from monumental sources such as tombs it is known that the symbolic fish was familiar to christians from the earliest times  the fish was depicted as a christian symbol in the first decades of the 2nd  its popularity among christians was due principally  it would seem  to the famous acrostic consisting of the initial letters of five greek words forming the word for fish  ichthys   which words briefly but clearly described the character of christ and the claim to worship of believers  iesous christos theou yios soter  ίησοῦς χριστός  θεοῦ υἱός  σωτήρ   meaning  jesus christ  son of god  major christian symbols include the chi-rho  monogram  the dove  symbolic of the holy spirit   the sacrificial lamb  symbolic of christ s sacrifice   the vine  symbolizing the necessary connectedness of the christian with christ  and many others  these all derive from writings found in the new is the ritual act  with the use of water  by which a person is admitted to membership of the church  beliefs on baptism vary among denominations  differences occur firstly on whether the act has any spiritual significance  some  such as the catholic and eastern orthodox churches  as well as lutherans and anglicans  hold to the doctrine of baptismal regeneration  which affirms that baptism creates or strengthens a person s faith  and is intimately linked to salvation  others view baptism as a purely symbolic act  an external public declaration of the inward change which has taken place in the person  but not as spiritually efficacious  secondly  there are differences of opinion on the methodology of the act  these methods are  by immersion  if immersion is total  by submersion  by affusion  pouring   and by aspersion  sprinkling   those who hold the first view may also adhere to the tradition of infant the orthodox churches all practice infant baptism and always baptize by total immersion repeated three times in the name of the father  the son and the holy the catholic church also practices infant usually by affusion  and utilizing the trinitarian teaching on prayer in the sermon on the mount displays a distinct lack of interest in the external aspects of prayer  a concern with the techniques of prayer is condemned as  pagan   and instead a simple trust in god s fatherly goodness is 6:5–15]  elsewhere in the new testament this same freedom of access to god is also 5:13–19]  this confident position should be understood in light of christian belief in the unique relationship between the believer and christ through the indwelling of the holy subsequent christian traditions  certain physical gestures are emphasized  including medieval gestures such as genuflection or making the sign of the cross  kneeling  bowing and prostrations  see also poklon  are often practiced in more traditional branches of christianity  frequently in western christianity the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal commendation ceremony  at other times the older orans posture may be used  with palms up and elbows in intercessory prayer is prayer offered for the benefit of other people  there are many intercessory prayers recorded in the bible  including prayers of the apostle peter on behalf of sick 9:40]  and by prophets of the old testament in favor of other 17:19–22]  in the epistle of james  no distinction is made between the intercessory prayer offered by ordinary believers and the prominent old testament prophet 5:16–18]  the effectiveness of prayer in christianity derives from the power of god rather than the status of the one ancient church  in both eastern christianity and western christianity  developed a tradition of asking for the intercession of  deceased  saints  and this remains the practice of most eastern orthodox  oriental orthodox  roman catholic  and some anglican churches  churches of the protestant reformation  however  rejected prayer to the saints  largely on the basis of the sole mediatorship of the reformer huldrych zwingli admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the bible convinced him that this was to the catechism of the catholic church   prayer is the raising of one s mind and heart to god or the requesting of good things from the book of common prayer in the anglican tradition is a guide which provides a set order for church services  containing set prayers  scripture readings  and hymns or sung psalms christianity began as a jewish sect in the levant of the middle east in the mid-1st  century  other than second temple judaism  the primary religious influences of early christianity are zoroastrianism and john bowker states that christian ideas such as  angels  the end of the world  a final judgment  the resurrection and heaven and hell received form and substance from     zoroastrian its earliest development took place under the leadership of the remaining twelve apostles  particularly saint peter  and paul the apostle  followed by the early bishops  whom christians consider the successors of the apostles according to the christian scriptures  christians were from the beginning subject to persecution by some jewish and roman religious authorities  who disagreed with the apostles  teachings  see split of early christianity and judaism   this involved punishments  including death  for christians such as 7:59]  and james  son of 12:2]  larger-scale  persecutions followed at the hands of the authorities of the roman empire  first in the year 64,  when emperor nero blamed them for the great fire of rome  according to church tradition  it was under nero s persecution that early church leaders peter and paul of tarsus were each martyred in rome further widespread persecutions of the church occurred under nine subsequent roman emperors  most intensely under decius and diocletian  from the year 150,  christian teachers began to produce theological and apologetic works aimed at defending the faith  these authors are known as the church fathers  and study of them is called patristics  notable early fathers include ignatius of antioch  polycarp  justin martyr  irenaeus  tertullian  clement of alexandria and origen  however  armenia is considered the first nation to accept christianity in ad trdat iv made christianity the state religion in armenia between 301  and 314,  it was not an entirely new religion in armenia  it penetrated into the country from at least the third century  but may have been present even persecution ceased in the 4th  century  when constantine i issued an edict of toleration in 313.  on 27  february 380,  emperor theodosius i enacted a law establishing nicene christianity as the state church of the roman from at least the 4th  century  christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of western was also instrumental in the convocation of the first council of nicaea in 325,  which sought to address the arian heresy and formulated the nicene creed  which is still used by the catholic church  eastern orthodoxy  anglican communion and many protestant nicaea was the first of a series of ecumenical  worldwide  councils which formally defined critical elements of the theology of the church  notably concerning the assyrian church of the east did not accept the third and following ecumenical councils  and are still separate today the presence of christianity in africa began in the middle of the 1st  century in egypt  and by the end of the 2nd  century in the region around carthage  mark the evangelist started the coptic orthodox church of alexandria in about ad important africans who influenced the early development of christianity includes tertullian  clement of alexandria  origen of alexandria  cyprian  athanasius and augustine of hippo  the later rise of islam in north africa reduced the size and numbers of christian congregations  leaving only the coptic church in egypt  the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church in the horn of africa and the nubian church in the

see university of oxford  university of paris and university of bologna   the traditional medieval universities—evolved from catholic and protestant church schools—then established specialized academic structures for properly educating greater numbers of students as professionals  prof  walter rüegg  editor of a history of the university in europe  reports that universities then only trained students to become clerics  lawyers  civil servants and teaching only theology  universities steadily added subjects including medicine  philosophy and law  becoming the direct ancestors of modern institutions of the university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the medieval christian prior to the establishment of universities  european higher education took place for hundreds of years in christian cathedral schools or monastic schools  scholae monasticae   in which monks and nuns taught classes  evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th  century the rise of the  new towns  throughout europe  mendicant orders were founded  bringing the consecrated religious life out of the monastery and into the new urban setting  the two principal mendicant movements were the and the founded by st  francis and st  dominic respectively  both orders made significant contributions to the development of the great universities of europe  another new order were the cistercians  whose large isolated monasteries spearheaded the settlement of former wilderness areas  in this period church building and ecclesiastical architecture reached new heights  culminating in the orders of romanesque and gothic architecture and the building of the great european 1095  under the pontificate of urban ii  the crusades were these were a series of military campaigns in the holy land and elsewhere  initiated in response to pleas from the byzantine emperor alexios i for aid against turkish expansion  the crusades ultimately failed to stifle islamic aggression and even contributed to christian enmity with the sacking of constantinople during the fourth a period stretching from the 7th  to the 13th  century  the christian church underwent gradual alienation  resulting in a schism dividing it into a so-called  latin or western christian branch  the roman catholic and an eastern  largely greek  branch  the orthodox church  these two churches disagree on a number of administrative  liturgical and doctrinal issues  most notably papal primacy of the second council of lyon (1274)  and the council of florence (1439)  attempted to reunite the churches  but in both cases the eastern orthodox refused to implement the decisions and the two principal churches remain in schism to the present day  however  the roman catholic church has achieved union with various smaller eastern churches beginning around 1184,  following the crusade against the cathar various institutions  broadly referred to as the inquisition  were established with the aim of suppressing heresy and securing religious and doctrinal unity within christianity through conversion and renaissance brought about a renewed interest in ancient and classical learning  another major schism  the reformation  resulted in the splintering of the western christendom into several martin luther in 1517  protested against the sale of indulgences and soon moved on to deny several key points of roman catholic reformers like zwingli  calvin  knox and arminius further criticized roman catholic teaching and worship  these challenges developed into the movement called protestantism  which repudiated the primacy of the pope  the role of tradition  the seven sacraments and other doctrines and the reformation in england began in 1534,  when king henry viii had himself declared head of the church of england  beginning in 1536,  the monasteries throughout england  wales and ireland were müntzer  andreas karlstadt and other theologians perceived both the roman catholic church and the confessions of the magisterial reformation as corrupted  their activity brought about the radical reformation  which gave birth to various anabaptist denominations partly in response to the protestant reformation  the roman catholic church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal  known as the counter-reformation  or catholic the council of trent clarified and reasserted roman catholic doctrine  during the following centuries  competition between roman catholicism and protestantism became deeply entangled with political struggles among european the discovery of america by christopher columbus in 1492  brought about a new wave of missionary activity  partly from missionary zeal  but under the impetus of colonial expansion by the european powers  christianity spread to the americas  oceania  east asia and sub-saharan  africa throughout europe  the divides caused by the reformation led to outbreaks of religious violence and the establishment of separate state churches in europe  lutheranism spread into northern  central and eastern parts of present-day  germany  livonia and scandinavia  anglicanism was established in england in 1534.  calvinism and its varieties  such as presbyterianism  were introduced in scotland  the netherlands  hungary  switzerland and france  arminianism gained followers in the netherlands and frisia  ultimately  these differences led to the outbreak of conflicts in which religion played a key factor  the thirty years  war  the english civil war and the french wars of religion are prominent examples  these events intensified the christian debate on persecution and the era known as the great divergence  when in the west the age of enlightenment and the scientific revolution brought about great societal changes  christianity was confronted with various forms of skepticism and with certain modern political ideologies such as versions of socialism and events ranged from mere anti-clericalism  to violent outbursts against christianity such as the dechristianisation during the french the spanish civil war and certain marxist movements  especially the russian revolution and the persecution of christians in the soviet union under state pressing in europe was the formation of nation states after the napoleonic era  in all european countries  different christian denominations found themselves in competition  to greater or lesser extents  with each other and with the state  variables are the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious  political and ideological orientation of the state  urs altermatt of the university of fribourg  looking specifically at catholicisms in europe  identifies four models for the european nations  in traditionally catholic countries such as belgium  spain and to some extent austria  religious and national communities are more or less identical  cultural symbiosis and separation are found in poland  ireland and switzerland  all countries with competing denominations  competition is found in germany  the netherlands and again switzerland  all countries with minority catholic populations who to a greater or lesser extent did identify with the nation  finally  separation between religion  again  specifically catholicism  and the state is found to a great degree in france and italy  countries where the state actively opposed itself to the authority of the catholic combined factors of the formation of nation states and ultramontanism  especially in germany and the netherlands but also in england  to a much lesser often forced catholic churches  organizations and believers to choose between the national demands of the state and the authority of the church  specifically the papacy  this conflict came to a head in the first vatican council  and in germany would lead directly to the kulturkampf  where liberals and protestants under the leadership of bismarck managed to severely restrict catholic expression and organization christian commitment in europe dropped as modernity and secularism came into their own in particularly in the czech republic and while religious commitments in america have been generally high in comparison to europe  the late 20th  century has shown the shift of christian adherence to the third world and southern hemisphere in general  with the western civilization no longer the chief standard bearer of christianity some europeans  including diaspora   indigenous peoples of the americas and natives of other continents have revived their respective peoples  historical folk religions  approximately 7.1  to 10%  of arabs are most prevalent in egypt  syria and lebanon with around 2.4  billion split into

a diversity of doctrines and practices among groups calling themselves christian  these groups are sometimes classified under denominations  though for theological reasons many groups reject this

in addition to the lutheran and reformed  or calvinist  branches of the reformation  there is anglicanism after the english reformation  the anabaptist tradition was largely ostracized by the other protestant parties at the time  but has achieved a measure of affirmation in more recent history  adventist  baptist  methodist  pentecostal and other protestant confessions arose in the following centuries as well as these modern divisions  there were many diverse christian communities with wildly different christologies  eschatologies  soteriologies and cosmologies that existed alongside the  early church  which is itself a projected concept to indicate which communities were "proto-orthodox",  in that their views would become dominate  in many ways  the first three centuries of christianity was significantly more diverse than the modern catholic church consists of those particular churches  headed by bishops  in communion with the pope  the bishop of rome  as its highest

over half of all christians as well as one sixth of the world s eastern orthodox church consists of those churches in communion with the patriarchal sees of the east  such as the ecumenical patriarch of like the roman catholic church  the eastern orthodox church also traces its heritage to the foundation of christianity through apostolic succession and has an episcopal structure  though the autonomy of its component parts is emphasized  and most of them are national churches  a number of conflicts with western christianity over questions of doctrine and authority culminated in the great schism  eastern orthodoxy is the second largest single denomination in christianity  with an estimated 225–300  million oriental orthodox churches  also called  old oriental  churches  are those eastern churches that recognize the first three ecumenical councils—nicaea  constantinople and ephesus—but reject the dogmatic definitions of the council of chalcedon and instead espouse a miaphysite

reformation  often followed by further the 18th  century  for example  methodism grew out of anglican minister john wesley s evangelical and revival several pentecostal and non-denominational  churches  which emphasize the cleansing power of the holy spirit  in turn grew out of because methodists  pentecostals and other evangelicals stress  accepting jesus as your personal lord and which

group of christians after roman catholicism in number of followers  although the eastern orthodox church is larger than any single protestant often that number is put at more than 800  million  corresponding to nearly 40%  of world s the majority of protestants are members of just a handful of denominational families  i e  adventists  anglicans  baptists  reformed lutherans  methodists and nondenominational  evangelical  charismatic  neo-charismatic,  independent and other churches are on the rise  and constitute a significant part of protestant special grouping are the anglican

the  one holy catholic church  alongside of the roman catholic and eastern orthodox churches  a concept rejected by the roman catholic church and some eastern anglicans  lutherans and the reformed branches of protestantism originated in the magisterial reformation  other protestant groups such as the anabaptists originated in the radical reformation and are distinguished by their rejection of infant baptism  they believe in baptism only of adult believers — credobaptism   anabaptists are made up mostly of amish  mennonites  hutterites and schwarzenau brethren german baptist groups   groups of individuals who hold basic protestant tenets identify themselves simply as  christians  or "born-again  christians   they typically distance themselves from the confessionalism and or creedalism of

religious revival that occurred in the united states during the early 1800s,  saw the development of a number of unrelated churches  they generally saw themselves as restoring the original church of

was known as the great in asia  iglesia ni cristo is a known restorationist religion that was established during the early 1900s.some  of the churches originating during this period are historically connected to early 19th-century  camp meetings in the midwest and upstate new york  american millennialism and adventism  which arose from evangelical protestantism  influenced the jehovah s witnesses movement and  as a reaction specifically to william miller  the seventh-day  adventists  others  including the christian church  disciples of christ   evangelical christian church in churches of christ  and the christian churches and churches of christ  have their roots in the contemporaneous stone-campbell  restoration movement  which was centered in kentucky and tennessee  other groups originating in this time period include the christadelphians and latter day saint movement  while the churches originating in the second great awakening have some superficial similarities  their doctrine and practices vary significantly various smaller independent catholic communities  such as the old catholic church  include the word catholic in their title  and arguably have more or less liturgical practices in common with the catholic church  but are no longer in full communion with the holy see esoteric christians regard christianity as a mystery and profess the existence and possession of certain esoteric doctrines or hidden from the public but accessible only to a narrow circle of  enlightened    initiated   or highly educated some of the esoteric christian institutions
