 the black sea is a body of water and marginal sea of the atlantic ocean between eastern europe and western it is supplied by a number of major rivers  such as the danube  dnieper  rioni  southern bug  and dniester  the black sea has an area of 436,400  km2  (168,500  sq mi   not including the sea of a maximum depth of 2,212  m (7,257  and a volume of 547,000  km3  (131,000  cu it is constrained by the pontic mountains to the south and by the caucasus mountains to the east  and features a wide shelf to the northwest  the longest east-west  extent is about 1,175  km (730  mi  important cities along the coast include batumi  burgas  constanța  giresun  istanbul  kerch  novorossiysk  odessa  ordu  poti  rize  samsun  sevastopol  sochi  sukhumi  trabzon  varna  yalta  and zonguldak the black sea has a positive water balance  that is  a net outflow of water 300  km3  (72  cu mi  per year through the bosphorus and the dardanelles into the aegean sea  mediterranean water flows into the black sea as part of a two-way  hydrological exchange  the black sea outflow is cooler and less saline  and floats over the warm  more saline mediterranean inflow – as a result of differences in density caused by differences in salinity – leading to a significant anoxic layer well below the surface waters  the black sea drains into the mediterranean sea  via the aegean sea and various straits  and is navigable to the atlantic ocean  the bosphorus strait connects it to the sea of marmara  and the strait of the dardanelles connects that sea to the aegean sea region of the mediterranean  these waters separate eastern europe and western asia  the black sea is also connected to the sea of azov by the strait of kerch the water level has varied significantly  due to these variations in the water level in the basin  the surrounding shelf and associated aprons have sometimes been land  at certain critical water levels it is possible for connections with surrounding water bodies to become established  it is through the most active of these connective routes  the turkish straits  that the black sea joins the world ocean  when this hydrological link is not present  the black sea is an endorheic basin  operating independently of the global ocean system  like the caspian sea for example  currently the black sea water level is relatively high  thus water is being exchanged with the mediterranean  the turkish straits connect the black sea with the aegean sea  and comprise the bosphorus  the sea of marmara and the dardanelles the international hydrographic organization defines the limits of the black sea as istanbul odessa samsun varnacurrent names of the sea are usually equivalents of the english name  black sea   including these given in the countries bordering the names have not yet been shown conclusively to predate the 13th  but there are indications that they may be considerably needed in greece  the historical name  euxine sea   which holds a different meaning  see below   is still widely used the black sea is one of four seas named in english after common colour terms—the others being the red sea  the white sea and the yellow sea the principal greek name  póntos áxeinos  itself is generally accepted to be a rendering of iranian *axšaina-   “dark colored”   cf  avestan axšaēna-   “dark colored”   old persian axšaina-   color of turquoise   middle persian axšēn xašēn   blue    and new persian xašīn   blue    as well as ossetic œxsīn  “dark the ancient greeks subsequently adopted the name  reportedly in all likelihood those who lived to the north of the black sea  and altered it into thereafter  greek tradition refers to the black sea as the  inhospitable sea   πόντος ἄξεινος póntos áxeinos  first attested in pindar  c  475  the name  considered to be  ominous   was then later changed into the euphemism  hospitable sea   εὔξεινος πόντος eúxeinos póntos  which was also for the first time attested in this became the commonly used designation in greek for the in contexts related to mythology  the older form  póntos áxeinos  remained it was erroneously suggested that the name had to be derived from the color of the water  or at least were to be related to climatic black  or dark   in this context however  referred to a system in which colors represented the various  cardinal points  of the known black  or dark represented the north  red the south  white for the west  and green or light blue for the this symbolism based on cardinal points was used in a plethora of different occasions  and is therefore widely for example  the  red sea   a body of water reported since the time of herodotus  c  484–c.  425  bc  in fact designated the indian ocean  together with bodies of water known as the persian gulf and the  actual  red according to the same explanation and reasoning  it is therefore considered to be impossible for the scythians  who principally roamed in what is present-day  ukraine and russia  to have given the designation as they lived to the north of the sea  and it would be therefore a southern antipodal body of water for as the name could have only been given by a people that were well aware of both the northern  black dark  and southern  red  seas  it is therefore considered probable that it was given its name by the achaemenids (550–330  geographica (1.2.10)  reports that in antiquity  the black sea was often just called  the sea   ὁ πόντος ho pontos   he also thought that the black sea was called  inhospitable  before greek colonization because it was difficult to navigate  and because its shores were inhabited by savage tribes.(7.3.6)  the name was changed to  hospitable  after the milesians had colonized the southern shoreline  the pontus  making it part of greek civilization in greater bundahishn  a sacred zoroastrian text written in middle persian the black sea is called map of asia dating to 1570,  entitled  asiae nova descriptio   from abraham ortelius s theatrum orbis terrarum  labels the sea mar maggior   great sea   cf  latin mare major).english-language  writers of the 18th  century often used the name  euxine sea    ˈjuːksɪn  or  ˈjuːkˌsaɪn   to refer to the black sea  edward gibbon  for instance  calls the sea by this name throughout the history of the decline and fall of the roman during the ottoman empire period  the black sea was called either bahr-e  siyah or karadeniz  both meaning  the black sea  in the ottoman turkish it is worthy to note  that in the tenth-century  geography book hudud al-'alam,  written in the persian language by an unknown author  the black sea is called  georgian sea    sea of georgians  ("daryä-yi  gurziyan   old georgian sources of 9th–14th  centuries   the georgian chronicles   were using the name  speris zğua   სპერის ზღუა   which means  the sea of speri   after the name of kartvelian tribe speris or saspers  now in turkey the modern names of the black sea  chyornoye more  karadeniz  etc    stretch only back to the 13th  geological origins of the basin can be traced back to two distinct relict back-arc  basins which were initiated by the splitting of an albian volcanic arc and the subduction of both the paleo-  and neo-tethys  oceans  but the timings of these events remain since its initiation  compressional tectonic environments led to subsidence in the basin  interspersed with extensional phases resulting in large-scale  volcanism and numerous orogenies  causing the uplift of the greater caucasus  pontides  southern crimean peninsula and balkanides mountain ongoing collision between the eurasian and african plates and westward escape of the anatolian block along the north anatolian fault and east anatolian faults dictates the current tectonic which features enhanced subsidence in the black sea basin and significant volcanic activity in the anatolian it is these geological mechanisms which  in the long term  have caused the periodic isolations of the black sea from the rest of the global ocean system the modern basin is divided into two sub-basins  by a convexity extending south from the crimean peninsula  the large shelf to the north of the basin is up to 190  km (120  mi  wide  and features a shallow apron with gradients between 1:40  and 1:1000.  the southern edge around turkey and the eastern edge around georgia  however  are typified by a narrow shelf that rarely exceeds 20  km (12  mi  in width and a steep apron that is typically 1:40  gradient with numerous submarine canyons and channel extensions  the euxine abyssal plain in the centre of the black sea reaches a maximum depth of 2,212  metres (7,257.22  feet  just south of yalta on the crimean littoral zone of the black sea is often referred to as the pontic littoral or pontic area surrounding the black sea is commonly referred to as the black sea region  its northern part lies within the chernozem belt  black soil belt  which goes from eastern croatia  slavonia   along the danube  northern serbia  northern bulgaria  danubian plain  and southern romania  wallachian plain   to northeast ukraine and further across the central black earth region and southern russia into black sea is a marginal sea and is the world s largest body of water with a meromictic the deep waters do not mix with the upper layers of water that receive oxygen from the atmosphere  as a result  over 90%  of the deeper black sea volume is anoxic the black sea s circulation patterns are primarily controlled by basin topography and fluvial inputs  which result in a strongly stratified vertical structure  because of the extreme stratification  it is classified as a salt wedge estuary the black sea only experiences water transfer with the mediterranean sea  so all inflow and outflow occurs in the bosphorus and dardanelles  inflow from the mediterranean has a higher salinity and density than the outflow  creating the classical estuarine circulation  this means that inflow of dense water from mediterranean occurs at the bottom of the basin while outflow of fresher black sea surface-water  into the marmara sea occurs near the surface  fresher surface water is the product of the fluvial inputs  and this makes the black sea a positive sea  the net input of freshwater creates an outflow volume about twice that of the inflow  evaporation and precipitation are roughly equal at about 300  cubic kilometres per year (72  cu of the narrowness and shallowness of the bosphorus and dardanelles  their respective depths are only 33  and 70  meters   inflow and outflow current speeds are high and there is significant vertical shear  this allows for turbulent mixing of the two surface water leaves the black sea with a salinity of 17  psu and reaches the mediterranean with a salinity of 34  psu  likewise  inflow of the mediterranean with salinity 38.5  psu experiences a decrease to about 34  surface circulation is cyclonic and waters around the perimeter of the black sea circulate in a basin-wide  shelfbreak gyre known as the rim current  the rim current has a maximum velocity of about 50–100  cm s  within this feature  two smaller cyclonic gyres operate  occupying the eastern and western sectors of the the eastern and western gyres are well-organized  systems in the winter but dissipate into a series of interconnected eddies in the summer and autumn  mesoscale activity in the peripheral flow becomes more pronounced during these warmer seasons and is subject to interannual variability outside of the rim current  numerous quasi-permanent  coastal eddies are formed as a result of upwelling around the coastal apron and  wind curl  mechanisms  the intra-annual  strength of these features is controlled by seasonal atmospheric and fluvial variations  during the spring  the batumi eddy forms in the southeastern corner of the the surface waters—from about 50–100  meters—there exists a halocline that stops at the cold intermediate layer  cil   this layer is composed of cool  salty surface waters  which are the result of localized atmospheric cooling and decreased fluvial input during the winter months  it is the remnant of the winter surface mixed the base of the cil is marked by a major pycnocline at about 100–200  metres (330–660  ft  and this density disparity is the major mechanism for isolation of the deep water below the pycnocline is the deep water mass  where salinity increases to 22.3  psu and temperatures rise to around 8.9  the hydrochemical environment shifts from oxygenated to anoxic  as bacterial decomposition of sunken biomass utilizes all of the free oxygen  weak geothermal heating and long residence time create a very thick convective bottom of the anoxic water at depth  organic matter  including anthropogenic artifacts such as boat hulls  are well preserved  during periods of high surface productivity  short-lived  algal blooms form organic rich layers known as sapropels  scientists have reported an annual phytoplankton bloom that can be seen in many nasa images of the as a result of these characteristics the black sea has gained interest from the field of marine archaeology as ancient shipwrecks in excellent states of preservation have been discovered  such as the byzantine wreck sinop d  located in the anoxic layer off the coast of sinop  turkey modelling shows the release of the hydrogen sulfide clouds in the event of an asteroid impact into the black sea would pose a threat to health—or even life—for people living on the black sea have been isolated reports of flares on the black sea occurring during thunderstorms  possibly caused by lightning igniting combustible gas seeping up from the sea black sea supports an active and dynamic marine ecosystem  dominated by species suited to the brackish  nutrient-rich,  conditions  as with all marine food webs  the black sea features a range of trophic groups  with autotrophic algae  including diatoms and dinoflagellates  acting as primary producers  the fluvial systems draining eurasia and central europe introduce large volumes of sediment and dissolved nutrients into the black sea  but distribution of these nutrients is controlled by the degree of physiochemical stratification  which is  in turn  dictated by seasonal physiographic winter  strong wind promotes convective overturning and upwelling of nutrients  while high summer temperatures result in a marked vertical stratification and a warm  shallow mixed day length and insolation intensity also controls the extent of the photic zone  subsurface productivity is limited by nutrient availability  as the anoxic bottom waters act as a sink for reduced nitrate  in the form of ammonia  the benthic zone also plays an important role in black sea nutrient cycling  as chemosynthetic organisms and anoxic geochemical pathways recycle nutrients which can be upwelled to the photic zone  enhancing total  black sea s biodiversity contains around one-third  of mediterranean s  and is experiencing natural and artificial invasions or main phytoplankton groups present in the black sea are dinoflagellates  diatoms  coccolithophores and cyanobacteria  generally  the annual cycle of phytoplankton development comprises significant diatom and dinoflagellate-dominated  spring production  followed by a weaker mixed assemblage of community development below the seasonal thermocline during summer months and a surface-intensified  autumn this pattern of productivity is also augmented by an emiliania huxleyi bloom during the late spring and summer months since the 1960s,  rapid industrial expansion along the black sea coast line and the construction of a major dam has significantly increased annual variability in the n p si ratio in the basin  in coastal areas  the biological effect of these changes has been an increase in the frequency of monospecific phytoplankton blooms  with diatom bloom frequency increasing by a factor of 2.5  and non-diatom  bloom frequency increasing by a factor of 6.  the non-diatoms,  such as the prymnesiophytes emiliania huxleyi  coccolithophore   chromulina sp   and the euglenophyte eutreptia lanowii are able to out-compete  diatom species because of the limited availability of si  a necessary constituent of diatom as a consequence of these blooms  benthic macrophyte populations were deprived of light  while anoxia caused mass mortality in marine decline in macrophytes was further compounded by overfishing during the 1970s,  while the invasive ctenophore mnemiopsis reduced the biomass of copepods and other zooplankton in the late 1980s.  additionally  an alien species—the warty comb jelly  mnemiopsis leidyi —was able to establish itself in the basin  exploding from a few individuals to an estimated biomass of one billion metric the change in species composition in black sea waters also has consequences for hydrochemistry  as ca-producing  coccolithophores influence salinity and ph  although these ramifications have yet to be fully quantified  in central black sea waters  si levels were also significantly reduced  due to a decrease in the flux of si associated with advection across isopycnal surfaces  this phenomenon demonstrates the potential for localised alterations in black sea nutrient input to have basin-wide  effects pollution reduction and regulation efforts have led to a partial recovery of the black sea ecosystem during the 1990s,  and an eu monitoring exercise  'eros21',  revealed decreased n and p values  relative to the 1989  recently  scientists have noted signs of ecological recovery  in part due to the construction of new sewage treatment plants in slovakia  hungary  romania  and bulgaria in connection with membership in the european union  mnemiopsis leidyi populations have been checked

kievan rus   which ranged to the black sea in the may have been a tiger or leopard  rather than a wolf or lynx  due to the way it behaved towards him and his climatic variation in the black sea region is significantly influenced by the operation of the north atlantic oscillation  the climatic mechanisms resulting from the interaction between the north atlantic and mid-latitude  air while the exact mechanisms causing the north atlantic oscillation remain it is thought the climate conditions established in western europe mediate the heat and precipitation fluxes reaching central europe and eurasia  regulating the formation of winter cyclones  which are largely responsible for regional precipitation and influence mediterranean sea surface temperatures relative strength of these systems also limits the amount of cold air arriving from northern regions during other influencing factors include the regional topography  as depressions and storms systems arriving from the mediterranean are funneled through the low land around the bosphorus  pontic and caucasus mountain ranges acting as wave guides  limiting the speed and paths of cyclones passing through the black sea is connected to the world ocean by a chain of two shallow straits  the dardanelles and the bosphorus  the dardanelles is 55  m (180  ft  deep and the bosphorus is as shallow as 36  m (118  ft   by comparison  at the height of the last ice age  sea levels were more than 100  m (330  ft  lower than they are now there is also evidence that water levels in the black sea were considerably lower at some point during the post-glacial  period  some researchers theorize that the black sea had been a landlocked freshwater lake  at least in upper layers  during the last glaciation and for some time after in the aftermath of the last glacial period  water levels in the black sea and the aegean sea rose independently until they were high enough to exchange water  the exact timeline of this development is still subject to debate  one possibility is that the black sea filled first  with excess fresh water flowing over the bosphorus sill and eventually into the mediterranean sea  there are also catastrophic scenarios  such as the  black sea deluge theory  put forward by william ryan  walter pitman and petko dimitrov the black sea deluge is a hypothesized catastrophic rise in the level of the black sea circa 5600  bc due to waters from the mediterranean sea breaching a sill in the bosporus strait  the hypothesis was headlined when the new york times published it in december 1996,  shortly before it was published in an academic while it is agreed that the sequence of events described did occur  there is debate over the suddenness  dating and magnitude of the events  relevant to the hypothesis is that its description has led some to connect this catastrophe with prehistoric flood black sea was a busy waterway on the crossroads of the ancient world  the balkans to the west  the eurasian steppes

submerged prehistoric settlements in the continental shelf and for ancient shipwrecks in the anoxic zone  which are expected to be exceptionally well preserved due to the absence of oxygen  this concentration of historical powers  combined with the preservative qualities of the deep anoxic waters of the black sea  has attracted increased interest from marine archaeologists who have begun to
