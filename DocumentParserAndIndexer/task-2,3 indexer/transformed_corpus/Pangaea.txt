 pangaea or pangea   was a supercontinent that existed during the late paleozoic and early mesozoic it assembled from earlier continental units approximately 335  million years ago  and it began to break apart about 175  million years in contrast to the present earth and its distribution of continental mass  much of pangaea was in the southern hemisphere and surrounded by a superocean  panthalassa  pangaea was the most recent supercontinent to have existed and the first to be reconstructed by geologists the name  pangaea pangea  is derived from ancient greek pan  πᾶν   all  entire  whole   and gaia  γαῖα   mother earth  the concept that the continents once formed a continuous land mass was first proposed by alfred wegener  the originator of the scientific theory of continental drift  in his 1912  publication the origin of continents  die entstehung der he expanded upon his hypothesis in his 1915  book the origin of continents and oceans  die entstehung der kontinente und ozeane   in which he postulated that  before breaking up and drifting to their present locations  all the continents had formed a single supercontinent that he called the  urkontinent  the name  pangea  occurs in the 1920  edition of die entstehung der kontinente und ozeane  but only once  when wegener refers to the ancient supercontinent as  the pangaea of the wegener used the germanized form  pangäa   but the name entered german and english scientific literature  in and 1926,  respectively  in the latinized form  pangaea   of the greek  pangaia    especially due to a symposium of the american association of petroleum geologists in november forming of supercontinents and their breaking up appears to have been cyclical through earth s history  there may have been many others before pangaea  the fourth-last  supercontinent  called columbia or nuna  appears to have assembled in the period 2.0–1.8  columbia nuna broke up and the next supercontinent  rodinia  formed from the accretion and assembly of its fragments  rodinia lasted from about 1.1  billion years ago  ga  until about 750  million years ago  but its exact configuration and geodynamic history are not nearly as well understood as those of the later supercontinents  pannotia and pangaea when rodinia broke up  it split into three pieces  the supercontinent of proto-laurasia,  the supercontinent of proto-gondwana,  and the smaller congo craton  proto-laurasia  and proto-gondwana  were separated by the proto-tethys  ocean  next proto-laurasia  itself split apart to form the continents of laurentia  siberia and baltica  baltica moved to the east of laurentia  and siberia moved northeast of laurentia  the splitting also created two new oceans  the iapetus ocean and paleoasian ocean  most of the above masses coalesced again to form the relatively short-lived  supercontinent of pannotia  this supercontinent included large amounts of land near the poles and  near the equator  only a relatively small strip connecting the polar masses  pannotia lasted until 540  ma  near the beginning of the cambrian period and then broke up  giving rise to the continents of laurentia  baltica  and the southern supercontinent of gondwana in the cambrian period  the continent of laurentia  which would later become north america  sat on the equator  with three bordering oceans  the panthalassic ocean to the north and west  the iapetus ocean to the south and the khanty ocean to the east  in the earliest ordovician  around 480  ma  the microcontinent of avalonia – a landmass incorporating fragments of what would become eastern newfoundland  the southern british isles  and parts of belgium  northern france  nova scotia  new england  south iberia and northwest africa – broke free from gondwana and began its journey to baltica  laurentia  and avalonia all came together by the end of the ordovician to form a minor supercontinent called euramerica or laurussia  closing the iapetus ocean  the collision also resulted in the formation of the northern appalachians  siberia sat near euramerica  with the khanty ocean between the two continents  while all this was happening  gondwana drifted slowly towards the south pole  this was the first step of the formation of second step in the formation of pangaea was the collision of gondwana with euramerica  by silurian time  440  ma  baltica had already collided with laurentia  forming euramerica  avalonia had not yet collided with laurentia  but as avalonia inched towards laurentia  the seaway between them  a remnant of the iapetus ocean  was slowly shrinking  meanwhile  southern europe broke off from gondwana and began to move towards euramerica across the newly formed rheic ocean  it collided with southern baltica in the devonian  though this microcontinent was an underwater plate  the iapetus ocean s sister ocean  the khanty ocean  shrank as an island arc from siberia collided with eastern baltica  now part of euramerica   behind this island arc was a new ocean  the ural ocean by late silurian time  north and south china split from gondwana and started to head northward  shrinking the proto-tethys  ocean in their path and opening the new paleo-tethys  ocean to their south  in the devonian period  gondwana itself headed towards euramerica  causing the rheic ocean to shrink  in the early carboniferous  northwest africa had touched the southeastern coast of euramerica  creating the southern portion of the appalachian mountains  the meseta mountains and the mauritanide mountains  south america moved northward to southern euramerica  while the eastern portion of gondwana  india  antarctica and australia  headed toward the south pole from the equator  north and south china were on independent continents  the kazakhstania microcontinent had collided with siberia   siberia had been a separate continent for millions of years since the deformation of the supercontinent pannotia in the middle carboniferous  western kazakhstania collided with baltica in the late carboniferous  closing the ural ocean between them and the western proto-tethys  in them  uralian orogeny   causing the formation of not only the ural mountains but also the supercontinent of laurasia  this was the last step of the formation of pangaea  meanwhile  south america had collided with southern laurentia  closing the rheic ocean and forming the southernmost part of the appalachians and ouachita mountains  by this time  gondwana was positioned near the south pole and glaciers were forming in antarctica  india  australia  southern africa and south america  the north china block collided with siberia by late carboniferous time  completely closing the proto-tethys  ocean by early permian time  the cimmerian plate split from gondwana and headed towards laurasia  thus closing the paleo-tethys  ocean  but forming a new ocean  the tethys ocean  in its southern end  most of the landmasses were all in one  by the triassic period  pangaea rotated a little and the cimmerian plate was still travelling across the shrinking paleo-tethys,  until the middle jurassic time  the paleo-tethys  had closed from west to east  creating the cimmerian orogeny  pangaea  which looked like a c  with the new tethys ocean inside the c  had rifted by the middle jurassic  and its deformation is explained below fossil evidence for pangaea includes the presence of similar and identical species on continents that are now great distances apart  for example  fossils of the therapsid lystrosaurus have been found in south africa  india and antarctica  alongside members of the glossopteris flora  whose distribution would have ranged from the polar circle to the equator if the continents had been in their present position  similarly  the freshwater reptile mesosaurus has been found in only localized regions of the coasts of brazil and west evidence for pangaea is found in the geology of adjacent continents  including matching geological trends between the eastern coast of south america and the western coast of africa  the polar ice cap of the carboniferous period covered the southern end of pangaea  glacial deposits  specifically till  of the same age and structure are found on many separate continents which would have been together in the continent of study of apparent polar wandering paths also support the theory of a supercontinent  geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks  when rocks are formed  they take on the magnetic properties of the earth and indicate in which direction the poles lie relative to the rock  since the magnetic poles drift about the rotational pole with a period of only a few thousand years  measurements from numerous lavas spanning several thousand years are averaged to give an apparent mean polar position  samples of sedimentary rock and intrusive igneous rock have magnetic orientations that are typically an average of the  secular variation  in the orientation of magnetic north because their remanent magnetizations are not acquired instantaneously  magnetic differences between sample groups whose age varies by millions of years is due to a combination of true polar wander and the drifting of continents  the true polar wander component is identical for all samples  and can be removed  leaving geologists with the portion of this motion that shows continental drift and can be used to help reconstruct earlier continental continuity of mountain chains provides further evidence for pangaea  one example of this is the appalachian mountains chain which extends from the southeastern united states to the caledonides of ireland  britain  greenland  and were three major phases in the break-up  of pangaea  the first phase began in the early-middle  jurassic  about 175  ma   when pangaea began to rift from the tethys ocean in the east to the pacific in the west  the rifting that took place between north america and africa produced multiple failed rifts  one rift resulted in a new ocean  the north atlantic atlantic ocean did not open uniformly  rifting began in the north-central  atlantic  the south atlantic did not open until the cretaceous when laurasia started to rotate clockwise and moved northward with north america to the north  and eurasia to the south  the clockwise motion of laurasia led much later to the closing of the tethys ocean and the widening of the  sinus borealis   which later became the arctic ocean  meanwhile  on the other side of africa and along the adjacent margins of east africa  antarctica and madagascar  new rifts were forming that would lead to the formation of the southwestern indian ocean that would open up in the cretaceous the second major phase in the break-up  of pangaea began in the early cretaceous (150–140  ma   when the minor supercontinent of gondwana separated into multiple continents  africa  south america  india  antarctica  and australia   the subduction at tethyan trench probably caused africa  india and australia to move northward  causing the opening of a  south indian ocean   in the early cretaceous  atlantica  today s south america and africa  finally separated from eastern gondwana  antarctica  india and australia   then in the middle cretaceous  gondwana fragmented to open up the south atlantic ocean as south america started to move westward away from africa  the south atlantic did not develop uniformly  rather  it rifted from south to north also  at the same time  madagascar and india began to separate from antarctica and moved northward  opening up the indian ocean  madagascar and india separated from each other 100–90  ma in the late cretaceous  india continued to move northward toward eurasia at 15  centimeters (6  in  a year  a plate tectonic record   closing the eastern tethys ocean  while madagascar stopped and became locked to the african plate  new zealand  new caledonia and the rest of zealandia began to separate from australia  moving eastward toward the pacific and opening the coral sea and tasman sea the third major and final phase of the break-up  of pangaea occurred in the early cenozoic  paleocene to oligocene   laurasia split when north america greenland  also called laurentia  broke free from eurasia  opening the norwegian sea about 60–55  ma  the atlantic and indian oceans continued to expand  closing the tethys ocean meanwhile  australia split from antarctica and moved quickly northward  just as india had done more than 40  million years before  australia is currently on a collision course with eastern asia  both australia and india are currently moving northeast at 5–6  centimeters (2–3  in  a year  antarctica has been near or at the south pole since the formation of pangaea about 280  ma  india started to collide with asia beginning about 35  ma  forming the himalayan orogeny  and also finally closing the tethys seaway  this collision continues today  the african plate started to change directions  from west to northwest toward europe  and south america began to move in a northward direction  separating it from antarctica and allowing complete oceanic circulation around antarctica for the first time  this motion  together with decreasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations  caused a rapid cooling of antarctica and allowed glaciers to form  this glaciation eventually coalesced into the kilometers-thick  ice sheets seen other major events took place during the cenozoic  including the opening of the gulf of california  the uplift of the alps  and the opening of the sea of japan  the break-up  of pangaea continues today in the red sea rift and east african rift pangaea s formation is now commonly explained in terms of plate tectonics  the involvement of plate tectonics in separation helps to show how it did not separate all at once  but at different times  in sequences  additionally  after these separations  it has also been discovered that the separated land masses may have also continued to break apart multiple times  the formation of each environment and climate on pangaea is due to plate tectonics  and thus  it is as a result of these shifts and changes different climatic pressures were placed on the life on pangaea  although plate tectonics was paramount in the formation of later land masses  it was also essential in the placement  climate  environments  habitats  and overall structure of can also be observed in relation to tectonic plates and pangaea  is the formations to such plates  mountains and valleys form due to tectonic collisions as well as earthquakes and chasms  consequentially  this shaped pangaea and animal adaptations  furthermore  plate tectonics can contribute to volcanic which is responsible for extinctions and adaptations which have evidently affected life over time  and without doubt on pangaea for the approximately 160  million years pangaea existed  many species had fruitful times whereas others struggled  the is an example of such prospering animals  eating a diet of only plants  plants dependent on spore reproduction had been taken out of the ecosystems  and replaced by the gymnosperm plant  which reproduces through the use of seeds instead  later on  insects  beetles  dragonflies  mosquitos  also thrived during the permian period 299  to 252  million years however  the permian extinction at 252  mya greatly impacted these insects in mass extinction  being the only mass extinction to affect insects  when the triassic period came  many reptiles were able to also thrive  including archosaurs  which were an ancestor to modern-day  crocodiles and birds little is known about marine life during the existence of pangaea  scientists are unable to find substantial evidence or fossilized remains in order to assist them in answering such questions  however  a couple of marine animals have been determined to have existed at the time-  the ammonites and brachiopods  additionally  evidence pointing towards massive reefs with varied ecosystems  especially in the species of sponges and coral  have also been needed pangaea has tremendously affected the setup of the world now  in the post pangaea time period  the reconfiguration of continents and oceans has changed the climate of many areas  there is scientific evidence that proves that climate was drastically altered  when the continents separated and reformed themselves  it changed the flow of the oceanic currents and winds  the scientific reasoning behind all of the changes is continental drift  the theory of continental drift  created by alfred wegener  explained how the continents shifted earth’s surface and how that affected many aspects such as climate  rock formations found on different continents and plant and animal wegener studied plant fossils from the frigid arctic of svalbard  norway  he determined that such plants were not meant to adapt to a glacial climate  the fossils he found were from tropical plants that were meant to adapt and thrive in warmer and tropical because we would not assume that the plant fossils were capable of traveling to a different place we suspect that svalbard possibly had a warmer  less frigid climate in the pangaea separated  the reorganization of the continents changed the function of the oceans and seaways  the restructuring of the continents  changed and altered the distribution of warmth and coolness of the oceans  when north america and south america connected  it stopped equatorial currents from passing from the atlantic ocean to the pacific researchers have found evidence by using computer hydrological models to show that this strengthened the gulf stream by diverting more warm currents towards europe  warm waters at high latitudes led to an increased evaporation and eventually atmospheric moisture  increased evaporation and atmospheric moisture resulted in increased precipitation  evidence of increased precipitation is the development of snow and ice that covers greenland  which led to an accumulation of the icecap  greenland’s growing ice cap led to further global scientists also found evidence of global cooling through the separation of australia and antarctica and the formation of the antarctic ocean  ocean currents in the newly formed antarctic or southern ocean created a circumpolar the creation of the new ocean that caused a circumpolar current eventually led to atmospheric currents that rotated from west to east  atmospheric and oceanic currents stopped the transfer of warm  tropical air and water to the higher latitudes  as a result of the warm air and currents moving northward  antarctica cooled down so much that it became frigid although many of alfred wegener’s theories and conclusions were valid  scientists are constantly coming up with new innovative ideas or reasoning behind why certain things happen  wegener’s theory of continental drift was later replaced by the theory of tectonic is evidence to suggest that the deterioration of northern pangaea contributed to the permian extinction  one of earth’s five major mass extinction events  which resulted in the loss of over 90%  of marine and 70%  of terrestrial species  there were three main sources of environmental deterioration which are believed to have had a hand in the extinction event the first of these sources is a loss of oxygen concentration in the ocean which caused deep water regions called the lysocline to grow shallower  with the lysocline shrinking  there were fewer places for calcite to dissolve in the ocean  considering calcite only dissolves at deep ocean depths  this led to the extinction of carbonate producers such as brachiopods and corals that relied on dissolved calcite to survive  the second source is the eruption of the siberian traps  a large volcanic event which is argued to be the result of pangaean tectonic this had several negative repercussions on the environment  including metal loading and excess atmospheric carbon  metal loading  the release of toxic metals from volcanic eruptions into the environment  led to acid rain and general stress on the environment  these toxic metals are known to infringe on vascular plants’ ability to photosynthesize  which may have resulted in the loss of permian-era  flora  excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is believed to be the main cause of the shrinking of lysocline areas the third cause of this extinction event that can be attributed to northern pangaea is the beginnings of anoxic ocean environments  or oceans with very low oxygen concentrations  the mix of anoxic oceans and ocean acidification due to metal loading led to increasingly acidic which ultimately led to the extinction of benthic africa antarctica asia australia europe north america south america afro-eurasia  america eurasia oceania
