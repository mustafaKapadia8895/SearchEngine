 in context of spaceflight  a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit  such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as earth s moon in 1957  the soviet union launched the world s first artificial satellite  sputnik 1.  since then  about 6,600  satellites from more than 40  countries have been launched  according to a 2013  estimate  3,600  remained in of those  about 1,000  were while the rest have lived out their useful lives and became space debris  approximately 500  operational satellites are in low-earth  orbit  50  are in medium-earth  orbit  at 20,000  km   and the rest are in geostationary orbit  at 36,000  a few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit  over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the moon  mercury  venus  mars  jupiter  saturn  a few and the sun satellites are used for many purposes  common types include military and civilian earth observation satellites  communications satellites  navigation satellites  weather satellites  and space telescopes  space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites  satellite orbits vary greatly  depending on the purpose of the satellite  and are classified in a number of ways  well-known   overlapping  classes include low earth orbit  polar orbit  and geostationary orbit a launch vehicle is a rocket that throws a satellite into orbit  usually it lifts off from a launch pad on land  some are launched at sea from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform  or aboard a plane  see air launch to orbit  satellites are usually semi-independent  computer-controlled  systems  satellite subsystems attend many tasks  such as power generation  thermal control  telemetry  attitude control and orbit control  newton s cannonball   presented as a  thought experiment  in a treatise of the system of the world  by isaac newton was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite the first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by edward everett hale  the brick the idea surfaced again in jules verne s the begum s fortune (1879).in  1903,  konstantin tsiolkovsky (1857–1935)  published exploring space using jet propulsion devices  in russian  исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами   which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft  he calculated the orbital speed required for a minimal orbit  and that a multi-stage  rocket fuelled by liquid propellants could achieve this in 1928,  herman potočnik (1892–1929)  published his sole book  the problem of space travel — the rocket motor  german  das problem der befahrung des weltraums — der raketen-motor).  he described the use of orbiting spacecraft for observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments in a 1945  wireless world article  the english science fiction writer arthur c  clarke (1917–2008)  described in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass he suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet the us military studied the idea of what was referred to as the earth satellite vehicle when secretary of defense james forrestal made a public announcement on 29  december 1948,  that his office was coordinating that project between the various first artificial satellite was sputnik 1,  launched by the soviet union on 4  october 1957,  and initiating the soviet sputnik program  with sergei korolev as chief designer  this in turn triggered the space race between the soviet union and the united states sputnik 1  helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal  distribution in the ionosphere  the unanticipated announcement of sputnik 1's  success precipitated the sputnik crisis in the united states and ignited the so-called  space race within the cold war sputnik 2  was launched on 3  november 1957  and carried the first living passenger into orbit  a dog named may  1946,  project rand had released the preliminary design of an experimental world-circling  spaceship  which stated   a satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the twentieth the united states had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945  under the bureau of aeronautics of the united states navy  the united states air force s project rand eventually released the report  but considered the satellite to be a tool for science  politics  and propaganda  rather than a potential military weapon  in 1954,  the secretary of defense stated   i know of no american satellite in february 1954  project rand released  scientific uses for a satellite vehicle   written by r r  this expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in june 1955  with  the scientific use of an artificial satellite   by h k  kallmann and w w  the context of activities planned for the international geophysical year (1957–58),  the white house announced on 29  july 1955  that the u s  intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958.  this became known as project vanguard  on 31  july  the soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.following  pressure by the american rocket society  the national science foundation  and the international geophysical year  military interest picked up and in early 1955  the army and navy were working on project orbiter  two competing programs  the army s which involved using a jupiter c rocket  and the civilian navy vanguard rocket  to launch a satellite  at first  they failed  initial preference was given to the vanguard program  whose first attempt at orbiting a satellite resulted in the explosion of the launch vehicle on national television  but finally  three months after sputnik 2,  the project succeeded  explorer 1  became the united states  first artificial satellite on 31  january june 1961,  three-and-a-half  years after the launch of sputnik 1,  the air force used resources of the united states space surveillance network to catalog 115  earth-orbiting  satellites were constructed as "one-off"  designs  with growth in geosynchronous  geo  satellite communication  multiple satellites began to be built on single model platforms called satellite buses  the first standardized satellite bus design was the hs-333  geo commsat  launched in 1972.the  largest artificial satellite currently orbiting the earth is the international space station the united states space surveillance network  ssn   a division of the united states strategic command  has been tracking objects in earth s orbit since 1957  when the soviet union opened the space age with the launch of sputnik i  since then  the ssn has tracked more than 26,000  objects  the ssn currently tracks more than 8,000  man-made  orbiting objects  the rest have re-entered  earth s atmosphere and disintegrated  or survived re-entry  and impacted the earth  the ssn tracks objects that are 10  centimeters in diameter or larger  those now orbiting earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10  pounds  about seven percent are operational satellites  i e  ~560  satellites   the rest are space the united states strategic command is primarily interested in the active satellites  but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles there are three basic categories of non-military  satellite satellite services handle hundreds of billions of voice  data  and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the earth s surface mobile satellite systems help connect remote regions  vehicles  ships  people and aircraft to other parts of the world and or other mobile or stationary communications units  in addition to serving as navigation systems scientific research satellites provide meteorological information  land survey data  e g  remote sensing   amateur  ham  radio  and other different scientific research applications such as earth science  marine science  and atmospheric research the first satellite  sputnik 1,  was put into orbit around earth and was therefore in geocentric orbit  by far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately artificial satellites orbiting the earth  geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude  inclination and eccentricity the commonly used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are low earth orbit  leo   medium earth orbit  meo  and high earth orbit  heo   low earth orbit is any orbit below 2,000  km  medium earth orbit is any orbit between 2,000  and 35,786  km  high earth orbit is any orbit higher than 35,786  km the general structure of a satellite is that it is connected to the earth stations that are present on the ground and connected through terrestrial links the satellite s functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics  looking at the  anatomy  of a typical satellite  one discovers two note that some novel architectural concepts such as fractionated spacecraft somewhat upset this taxonomy the bus module consists of the following subsystems the structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch  maintain structural integrity and stability while on station in orbit  and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite  damage the telemetry subsystem  aka command and data handling  c dh  monitors the on-board  equipment operations  transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station  and receives the earth control station s commands to perform equipment operation adjustments the power subsystem consists of solar panels to convert solar energy into electrical power  regulation and distribution functions  and batteries that store power and supply the satellite when it passes into the earth s shadow  nuclear power sources  radioisotope thermoelectric generator have also been used in several successful satellite programs including the nimbus program thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellite s body  e g  optical solar reflector the attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation  control laws embedded in the flight software  and actuators  reaction wheels  thrusters   these apply the torques and forces needed to re-orient  the vehicle to a desired attitude  keep the satellite in the correct orbital position  and keep antennas pointed in the right directions the second major module is the communication payload  which is made up of transponders  a transponder is capable of  when satellites reach the end of their mission  this normally occurs within 3  or 4  years after launch   satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting  the satellite  leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit  historically  due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions  satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited.  one example of this practice is the satellite vanguard 1.  launched in 1958,  vanguard 1,  the 4th  manmade satellite put in geocentric orbit  was still in orbit as of august of being de-orbited,  most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a graveyard as of 2002,  the fcc requires all geostationary satellites to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life prior to in cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting,  the major variable is the solar flux  and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself  and the gravitational perturbations generated by the sun and the moon  as well as those exercised by large mountain ranges  whether above or below sea level   the nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and temperatures is 78  km  with a range between 72  and 84  km  solar panels  however  are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90  and 95  list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit  including production of the necessary launch vehicle  note  many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites but are unable to launch them  instead relying on foreign launch services  this list does not consider those numerous countries  but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously  and the date this capability was first demonstrated  the list includes the european space agency  a multi-national  state organization  but does not include private consortiums a few other private companies are capable of sub-orbital  launches while canada was the third country to build a satellite which was launched into it was launched aboard an american rocket from an american spaceport  the same goes for australia  who launched first satellite involved a donated u s  redstone rocket and american support staff as well as a joint launch facility with the united the first italian satellite san marco 1  launched on 15  december 1964  on a u s  scout rocket from wallops island  virginia  united states  with an italian launch team trained by by similar occasions  almost all further first national satellites was launched by foreign rockets.†-note:  both chile and belarus used russian companies as principal contractors to build their satellites  they used russian-ukrainian  manufactured rockets and launched either from russia or kazakhstan in recent satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication testing purposes  satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth  russia  the united states and china have demonstrated the ability to eliminate in 2007  the chinese military shot down an aging weather followed by the us navy shooting down a defunct spy satellite in february to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions  they are prone to jamming by land-based  transmitters  such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitter s range  gps satellites are potential targets for but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite s transponder  it is common for earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space  and dual-illuminate  the transponder  rendering the frequency unusable  satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space needed
