 atmospheric physics atmospheric dynamics  category weather  category  ·  portal climate  category  climate change  category meteorology is a branch of the atmospheric sciences which includes atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics  with a major focus on weather forecasting  the study of meteorology dates back millennia  though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 18th  century  the 19th  century saw modest progress in the field after weather observation networks were formed across broad regions  prior attempts at prediction of weather depended on historical data  it wasn t until after the elucidation of the laws of physics and  more particularly  the development of the computer  allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather  in the latter half of the 20th  century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved meteorological phenomena are observable weather events that are explained by the science of meteorology  meteorological phenomena are described and quantified by the variables of earth s atmosphere  temperature  air pressure  water vapor  mass flow  and the variations and interactions of those variables  and how they change over time  different spatial scales are used to describe and predict weather on local  regional  and global levels meteorology  climatology  atmospheric physics  and atmospheric chemistry are sub-disciplines  of the atmospheric sciences  meteorology and hydrology compose the interdisciplinary field of hydrometeorology  the interactions between earth s atmosphere and its oceans are part of a coupled ocean-atmosphere  system  meteorology has application in many diverse fields such as the military  energy production  transport  agriculture  and construction the word  meteorology  is from greek μετέωρος metéōros  lofty  high  in the sky    from μετα-  meta-   above  and ἀείρω aeiro  i lift up   and -λογία  -logia  "-(o)logy",  i e   the study of things in the air  the ability to predict rains and floods based on annual cycles was evidently used by humans at least from the time of agricultural settlement if not earlier  early approaches to predicting weather were based on astrology and were practiced by priests  cuneiform inscriptions on babylonian tablets included associations between thunder and rain  the chaldeans differentiated the 22°  and 46°  indian upanishads contain mentions of clouds and the samaveda mentions sacrifices to be performed when certain phenomena were varāhamihira s classical work

meteorology is the description of what is now known as the hydrologic book de mundo  composed before 250  bc or between 350  and 200  bc  greek scientist theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting  called the book of signs  the work of theophrastus remained a dominant influence in the study of weather and in weather forecasting for nearly 2,000  in 25  ad  pomponius mela  a

phases indicating seasons and rain  the anwa  heavenly bodies of rain   and atmospheric phenomena such as winds  thunder  lightning  snow  floods  valleys  rivers  needed early attempts at predicting weather were often related to prophesy and divining and sometimes based on astrological ideas  admiral fitzroy tried to separate scientific approaches from prophetic wrote on the atmospheric refraction of light in the context of astronomical in 1021,  alhazen showed that atmospheric refraction is also responsible for twilight  he estimated that twilight begins when the sun is 19  degrees below the horizon  and also used a geometric determination based on this to estimate the maximum possible height of the earth s atmosphere as 52,000  passim  about 49  miles  or 79  albert the great was the first to propose that each drop of falling rain had the form of a small sphere  and that this form meant that the rainbow was produced by light interacting with each roger bacon was the first to calculate the angular size of the rainbow  he stated that a rainbow summit can not appear higher than 42  degrees above the in the late 13th  century and early 14th  century  kamāl al-dīn

decided that cyclones move in a contrary manner to the winds at their understanding the kinematics of how exactly the rotation of the earth affects airflow was partial at first  gaspard-gustave  coriolis published a paper in 1835  on the energy yield of machines with rotating parts  such as in 1856,  william ferrel proposed the existence of a circulation cell in the mid-latitudes,  and the air within deflected by the coriolis force resulting in the prevailing westerly late in the 19th  century  the motion of air masses along isobars was understood to be the result of the large-scale  interaction of the pressure gradient force and the deflecting force  by 1912,  this deflecting force was named the coriolis just after world war i  a group of meteorologists in norway led by vilhelm bjerknes developed the norwegian cyclone model that explains the generation  intensification and ultimate decay  the life cycle  of mid-latitude  cyclones  and introduced the idea of fronts  that is  sharply defined boundaries between air the group included carl-gustaf  rossby  who was the first to explain the large scale atmospheric flow in terms of fluid dynamics   tor bergeron  who first determined how rain forms  and jacob bjerknes in 1654,  ferdinando ii de medici established the first weather observing network  that consisted of meteorological stations in florence  cutigliano  vallombrosa  bologna  parma  milan  innsbruck  osnabrück  paris and warsaw  the collected data were sent to florence at regular time in 1832,  an electromagnetic telegraph was created by baron the arrival of the electrical telegraph in 1837  afforded  for the first time  a practical method for quickly gathering surface weather observations from a wide this data could be used to produce maps of the state of the atmosphere for a region near the earth s surface and to study how these states evolved through time  to make frequent weather forecasts based on these data required a reliable network of observations  but it was not until 1849  that the smithsonian institution began to establish an observation network across the united states under the leadership of joseph similar observation networks were established in europe at this time  the reverend william clement ley was key in understanding of cirrus clouds and early understandings of jet later after this charles kenneth mackinnon douglas known as  ckm  douglas read ley s papers after his death and carried on the early study of weather nineteenth century researchers in meteorology were drawn from military or medical backgrounds  rather than trained as dedicated in 1854,  the united kingdom government appointed robert fitzroy to the new office of meteorological statist to the board of trade with the task of gathering weather observations at sea  fitzroy s office became the united kingdom meteorological office in 1854,  the second oldest national meteorological service in the world  the central institution for meteorology and geodynamics  zamg  in austria was founded in 1851  and is the oldest weather service in the world   the first daily weather forecasts made by fitzroy s office were published in the times newspaper in 1860.  the following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at principal ports when a gale was expected over the next 50  years many countries established national meteorological services  the india meteorological department (1875)  was established to follow tropical cyclone and the finnish meteorological central office (1881)  was formed from part of magnetic observatory of helsinki japan s tokyo meteorological observatory  the forerunner of the japan meteorological agency  began constructing surface weather maps in the united states weather bureau (1890)

norwegian scientist vilhelm bjerknes first argued in his paper weather forecasting as a problem in mechanics and physics that it should be possible to forecast weather from calculations based upon natural was not until later in the 20th  century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction  in 1922,  lewis fry richardson published  weather prediction by numerical after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in world war i  he described how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations that govern atmospheric flow could be neglected  and a numerical calculation scheme that could be devised to allow predictions  richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations  however  the sheer number of calculations required was too large to complete without electronic computers  and the size of the grid and time steps used in the calculations led to unrealistic results  though numerical analysis later found that this was due to numerical instability starting in the 1950s,  numerical forecasts with computers became the first weather forecasts derived this way used barotropic (single-vertical-level)  models  and could successfully predict the large-scale  movement of midlatitude rossby waves  that is  the pattern of atmospheric lows and in 1959,  the uk meteorological office received its first computer  a ferranti needed in the 1960s,  the chaotic nature of the atmosphere was first observed and mathematically described by edward lorenz  founding the field of chaos these advances have led to the current use of ensemble forecasting in most major forecasting centers  to take into account uncertainty arising from the chaotic nature of the mathematical models used to predict the long term weather of the earth  climate models   have been developed that have a resolution today that are as coarse as the older weather prediction models  these climate models are used to investigate long-term  climate shifts  such as what effects might be caused by human emission of greenhouse gases meteorologists are scientists who study the american meteorological society published and continually updates an authoritative electronic meteorology meteorologists work in government agencies  private consulting and research services  industrial enterprises  utilities  radio and television stations  and in education  in the united states  meteorologists held about 9,400  jobs in are best known by the public for weather forecasting  some radio and television weather forecasters are professional meteorologists  while others are reporters  weather specialist  weatherman  etc   with no formal meteorological training  the american meteorological society and national weather association issue  seals of approval  to weather broadcasters who meet certain requirements each science has its own unique sets of laboratory equipment  in the atmosphere  there are many things or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured  rain  which can be observed  or seen anywhere and anytime was one of the first atmospheric qualities measured historically  also  two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity  neither of these can be seen but can be felt  the devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th  century and were respectively the rain gauge  the anemometer  and the hygrometer  many attempts had been made prior to the 15th  century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables  many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable  even aristotle noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air sets of surface measurements are important data to meteorologists  they give a snapshot of a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a weather station  a ship or a weather buoy  the measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables  usually  temperature  pressure  wind measurements  and humidity are the variables that are measured by a thermometer  barometer  anemometer  and hygrometer  professional stations may also include air quality sensors  carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide  methane  ozone  dust  and smoke   ceilometer  cloud ceiling   falling precipitation sensor  flood sensor  lightning sensor  microphone  explosions  sonic booms  thunder   pyranometer pyrheliometer spectroradiometer  ir vis uv photodiodes   rain gauge snow gauge  scintillation counter  background radiation  fallout  radon   seismometer  earthquakes and tremors   transmissometer  visibility   and a gps clock for data logging  upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting  the most widely used technique is launches of radiosondes  supplementing the radiosondes a network of aircraft collection is organized by the world meteorological organization remote sensing  as used in meteorology  is the concept of collecting data from remote weather events and subsequently producing weather information  the common types of remote sensing are radar  lidar  and satellites  or photogrammetry   each collects data about the atmosphere from a remote location and  usually  stores the data where the instrument is located  radar and lidar are not passive because both use em radiation to illuminate a specific portion of the weather satellites along with more general-purpose  earth-observing  satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to el niño the study of the atmosphere can be divided into distinct areas that depend on both time and spatial scales  at one extreme of this scale is climatology  in the timescales of hours to days  meteorology separates into micro-,  meso-,  and synoptic scale meteorology  respectively  the geospatial size of each of these three scales relates directly with the appropriate timescale other subclassifications are used to describe the unique  local  or broad effects within those subclasses microscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena on a scale of about 1  kilometre (0.62  mi  or less  individual thunderstorms  clouds  and local turbulence caused by buildings and other obstacles  such as individual hills  are modeled on this meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena that has horizontal scales ranging from 1  km to 1000  km and a vertical scale that starts at the earth s surface and includes the atmospheric boundary layer  troposphere  tropopause  and the lower section of the stratosphere  mesoscale timescales last from less than a day to weeks  the events typically of interest are thunderstorms  squall lines  fronts  precipitation bands in tropical and extratropical cyclones  and topographically generated weather systems such as mountain waves and sea and land scale meteorology predicts atmospheric changes at scales up to 1000  km and 105  sec (28  days   in time and space  at the synoptic scale  the coriolis acceleration acting on moving air masses  outside of the tropics  plays a dominant role in predictions  the phenomena typically described by synoptic meteorology include events such as extratropical cyclones  baroclinic troughs and ridges  frontal zones  and to some extent jet streams  all of these are typically given on weather maps for a specific time  the minimum horizontal scale of synoptic phenomena is limited to the spacing between surface observation scale meteorology is the study of weather patterns related to the transport of heat from the tropics to the poles  very large scale oscillations are of importance at this scale  these oscillations have time periods typically on the order of months  such as the madden–julian oscillation  or years  such as the el niño–southern oscillation and the pacific decadal oscillation  global scale meteorology pushes into the range of climatology  the traditional definition of climate is pushed into larger timescales and with the understanding of the longer time scale global oscillations  their effect on climate and weather disturbances can be included in the synoptic and mesoscale timescales predictions numerical weather prediction is a main focus in understanding air–sea interaction  tropical meteorology  atmospheric predictability  and tropospheric stratospheric the naval research laboratory in monterey  california  developed a global atmospheric model called navy operational global atmospheric prediction system  nogaps   nogaps is run operationally at fleet numerical meteorology and oceanography center for the united states military  many other global atmospheric models are run by national meteorological agencies boundary layer meteorology is the study of processes in the air layer directly above earth s surface  known as the atmospheric boundary layer  abl   the effects of the surface – heating  cooling  and friction – cause turbulent mixing within the air layer  significant movement of heat  matter  or momentum on time scales of less than a day are caused by turbulent boundary layer meteorology includes the study of all types of surface–atmosphere boundary  including ocean  lake  urban land and non-urban  land for the study of meteorology dynamic meteorology generally focuses on the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere  the idea of air parcel is used to define the smallest element of the atmosphere  while ignoring the discrete molecular and chemical nature of the atmosphere  an air parcel is defined as a point in the fluid continuum of the atmosphere  the fundamental laws of fluid dynamics  thermodynamics  and motion are used to study the atmosphere  the physical quantities that characterize the state of the atmosphere are temperature  density  pressure  etc  these variables have unique values in the forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere at a future time and given location  humans have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since at least the 19th  weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will an all-human  endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure  current weather conditions  and sky forecast models are now used to determine future conditions  human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon  which involves pattern recognition skills  teleconnections  knowledge of model performance  and knowledge of model biases  the chaotic nature of the atmosphere  the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere  error involved in measuring the initial conditions  and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made  the range of the forecast  increases  the use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts  weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets  temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming on an everyday basis  people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear  since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain  snow  and wind chill  forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events  and to plan ahead and survive them aviation meteorology deals with the impact of weather on air traffic management  it is important for air crews to understand the implications of weather on their flight plan as well as their aircraft  as noted by the aeronautical information effects of ice on aircraft are cumulative—thrust is reduced  drag increases  lift lessens  and weight increases  the results are an increase in stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance  in extreme cases  2  to 3  inches of ice can form on the leading edge of the airfoil in less than 5  minutes  it takes but 1/2  inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50  percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal soil scientists  agricultural hydrologists  and agronomists are persons concerned with studying the effects of weather and climate on plant distribution  crop yield  water-use  efficiency  phenology of plant and animal development  and the energy balance of managed and natural ecosystems  conversely  they are interested in the role of vegetation on climate and is the branch of meteorology that deals with the hydrologic cycle  the water budget  and the rainfall statistics of a hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating  quantitative  precipitation  heavy rain  heavy snow  and highlights areas with the potential for flash flooding  typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology  mesoscale and synoptic meteorology  and other multidisciplinary nature of the branch can result in technical challenges  since tools and solutions from each of the individual disciplines involved may behave slightly differently  be optimized for different hard-  and software platforms and use different data formats  there are some initiatives -  such as the drihm -  that are trying to address this meteorology investigates the distribution of radioactive aerosols and gases in the meteorology deals with air and wave forecasts for ships operating at sea  organizations such as the ocean prediction center  honolulu national weather service forecast office  united kingdom met office  and jma prepare high seas forecasts for the world s oceans military meteorology is the research and application of meteorology for military purposes  in the united states  the united states navy s commander  naval meteorology and oceanography command oversees meteorological efforts for the navy and marine corps while the united states air force s air force weather agency is responsible for the air force and army environmental meteorology mainly analyzes industrial pollution dispersion physically and chemically based on meteorological parameters such as temperature  humidity  wind  and various weather conditions meteorology applications in renewable energy includes basic research   exploration   and potential mapping of wind power and solar radiation for wind and solar energy please see weather forecasting for weather forecast sites
