 the indigenous peoples of the americas are the pre-columbian  peoples of the americas and their descendants although some indigenous peoples of the americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers—and  many  especially in the amazon basin  still are—many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture  the impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the although some societies depended heavily on agriculture  others practiced a mix of farming  hunting  and gathering  in some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture  large-scale  organized cities  chiefdoms  states  and empires many parts of the americas are still populated by indigenous peoples  some countries have sizable populations  especially belize  bolivia  chile  ecuador  greenland  guatemala  mexico  and peru  at least a thousand different indigenous languages are spoken in the americas  some  such as the quechuan languages  aymara  guaraní  mayan languages  and nahuatl  count their speakers in millions  many also maintain aspects of indigenous cultural practices to varying degrees  including religion  social organization  and subsistence practices  like most cultures  over time  cultures specific to many indigenous peoples have evolved to incorporate traditional aspects  but also cater to modern needs  some indigenous peoples still live in relative isolation from western culture and a few are still counted as uncontacted peoples indígenas or pueblos indígenas   indigenous peoples   is a common term in spanish-speaking  countries  and pueblos nativos or nativos  lit   native peoples   may also be heard  while aborigen  aborigine  is used in argentina  and pueblos aborígenes  aboriginal peoples  is common in chile  the term  amerindian   short for   indians of the americas   is used in quebec  the guianas  and the english-speaking  in brazil  indígenas or povos indígenas are common if formal-sounding  designations  while índio is still the more often-heard  term  the noun for the indian nationality being indiano   and aborígene and nativo being rarely used in amerindian-specific  contexts  e g  aborígene is usually understood as the ethnonym for indigenous australians   indigenous peoples are commonly known in canada as aboriginal peoples  which includes not only first nations and arctic inuit  but also the minority population of first nations-european  mixed-race  métis who identify culturally and ethnically with indigenous peoplehood  this is contrasted  for instance  to the american indian-european  mixed-race  mestizos of hispanic america  caboclos in brazil  who  with their larger population  in most latin american countries constituting either outright majorities  pluralities  or at the least large minorities   identify largely as a new ethnic group distinct from both europeans and indigenous americans  but still considering themselves a subset of the european-derived  hispanic or brazilian peoplehood in culture and ethnicity  cf  ladinos  indigenous peoples of the united states are commonly known as native americans or american indians  and alaska of the term  indian  originated with christopher columbus  who  in his search for india  thought that he had arrived in the east eventually  those islands came to be known as the  west indies   a name still used  this led to the blanket term  indies  and  indians   spanish indios  portuguese índios  for the indigenous inhabitants  which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the indigenous peoples of the americas  this unifying concept  codified in law  religion  and politics  was not originally accepted by the myriad groups of indigenous peoples themselves  but has since been embraced by many over the last two needed  even though the term  indian  generally does not include the culturally and linguistically distinct indigenous peoples of the arctic regions of the americas—such as the aleuts  inuit  or yupik peoples  who entered the continent as a second more recent wave of migration several thousand years before  and have much more recent genetic and cultural commonalities with the aboriginal peoples of the asiatic arctic russian far east—these groups are nonetheless considered  indigenous peoples of the americas   the portuguese and spanish equivalents to indian  nevertheless  could be used to mean any hunter-gatherer  or full-blooded  indigenous person  particularly to continents other than europe or africa—for example  indios filipinos the specifics of paleo-indian  migration to and throughout the americas  including the exact dates and routes traveled  are the subject of ongoing research and according to archaeological and genetic evidence  north and south america were the last continents in the world to gain human during the wisconsin glaciation  50–17,000  years ago  falling sea levels allowed people to move across the land bridge of beringia that joined siberia to northwest north america alaska was a glacial refugium because it had low snowfall  allowing a small population to exist  the laurentide ice sheet covered most of north america  blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to alaska  east beringia  for thousands of genetic studies suggest that the first inhabitants of the americas share a single ancestral population  one that developed in isolation  conjectured to be the isolation of these peoples in beringia might have lasted 10–20,000  around 16,500  years ago  the glaciers began melting  allowing people to move south and east into canada and these people are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct  pleistocene megafauna along ice-free  corridors that stretched between the laurentide and cordilleran ice route proposed involves migration – either on foot or using primitive boats – along the pacific northwest coast to the south  including as far as south archeological evidence of the latter would have been covered by the sea level rise of more than 120  meters since the last ice time range of 40,000–16,500  years ago is debatable and probably will remain so for years to the few agreements achieved to date tools  particularly projectile points and scrapers  are the primary evidence of the earliest human activity in the americas  archaeologists and anthropologists have studied differences among these crafted lithic flaked tools to classify cultural the clovis culture  the earliest definitively-dated  paleo-indians  in the americas  appears around 11,500  rcbp  radiocarbon years before equivalent to 13,500  to 13,000  calendar years ago in 2014,  the autosomal dna was sequenced of a 12,500+-year-old  infant from montana  whose remains were found in close association with several clovis these are the anzick-1  remains from the anzick clovis burial in montana  the data indicate that the individual was closely related to present north american native american populations  but  the dna was ancestral to present-day  south american and central american native american populations  the implication is that there was an early divergence between north american indigenous peoples and those of central and south america  ruled out were ruled hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the after study  the remains were returned to montana for burial by native americans similarly  the skeleton of a teenage girl  named  naia  after a water nymph from greek mythology  was found in 2007  in the underwater caves called sistema sac actun in mexico s eastern yucatán peninsula  dna was extracted and dated  the skeleton was found to be 13,000  years old  and it is considered the oldest genetically intact human skeleton ever found in the americas  the dna indicates she was from a lineage derived from asian origins and also represented in the dna of the modern native pre-columbian  era refers to all period subdivisions in the history and prehistory of the americas before the appearance of significant european and african influences on the american continents  spanning the time of the original arrival in the upper paleolithic to european colonization during the early modern technically referring to the era before christopher columbus  voyages of 1492  to 1504,  in practice the term usually includes the history of american indigenous cultures until europeans either conquered or significantly influenced "pre-columbian"  is used especially often in the context of discussing the pre-contact  mesoamerican indigenous societies  olmec  toltec  teotihuacano  zapotec  mixtec  aztec and maya civilizations  and the complex cultures of the andes  inca empire  moche culture  muisca confederation  and cañari the norte chico civilization  in present-day  peru  is one of the defining six original civilizations of the world  arising independently around the same time as that of many later pre-columbian  civilizations achieved great complexity  with hallmarks that included permanent or urban settlements  agriculture  civic and monumental architecture  and complex societal hierarchies  some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first significant european and african arrivals  ca  late 15th–early  16th  centuries   and are known only through oral history and through archaeological investigations  others were contemporary with the contact and colonization period  and were documented in historical accounts of the time  a few  such as the mayan  olmec  mixtec  and nahua peoples  had their own written languages and records  however  the european colonists of the time worked to eliminate non-christian  beliefs  and burned many pre-columbian  written records  only a few documents remained hidden and survived  leaving contemporary historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge according to both indigenous american and european accounts and documents  american civilizations before and at the time of european encounter had achieved great complexity and many for instance  the aztecs built one of the largest cities in the world  tenochtitlan  the ancient site of mexico city  with an estimated population of 200,000.  american civilizations also displayed impressive accomplishments in astronomy and mathematics  the domestication of maize or corn required thousands of years of selective breeding  and continued cultivation of multiple varieties was done with planning and selection  generally by women inuit  yupik  aleut  and american indian creation myths tell of a variety of origins of their respective peoples  some were  always there  or were created by gods or animals  some migrated from a specified compass point  and others came from  across the european colonization of the americas fundamentally changed the lives and cultures of the native peoples of the continents  although the exact pre-contact  population-count  of the americas is unknown  scholars estimate that native american populations diminished by between 80  and 90%  within the first centuries of contact with europeans  the leading cause was disease  epidemics ravaged the americas with diseases such as smallpox  measles  and cholera  which the early explorers brought from europe and which spread quickly into new areas even before later explorers and colonists reached them  native americans suffered high mortality rates due to their lack of prior exposure to these diseases  conflicts between colonists and indigenous people exacerbated the loss of lives  colonists perpetrated massacres on the indigenous groups and enslaved according to the u s  bureau of the census (1894),  the north american indian wars of the 19th  century cost the lives of about 19,000  whites and 30,000  native first indigenous group encountered by columbus  the

indians  the laws forbade the maltreatment of natives and endorsed their conversion to the spanish crown found it difficult to enforce these laws in distant colonies various theories for the decline of the native american populations emphasize epidemic diseases  conflicts with europeans  and conflicts among warring tribes  believe that  among the various contributing factors  epidemic disease was

animals escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the the re-introduction  of the horse  extinct in the americas for over 7500  years  had a profound impact on native american culture in the great plains of north america and in patagonia in south america  by domesticating horses  some tribes had great success  horses enabled them to expand their territories  exchange more goods with neighboring tribes  and more easily capture game  especially bison over time and thousands of years  american indigenous peoples domesticated  bred and cultivated a large array of plant species  these species now constitute 50–60%  of all crops in cultivation in certain cases  the indigenous peoples developed entirely new species and strains through artificial selection  as was the case in the domestication and breeding of maize from wild teosinte grasses in the valleys of southern mexico  numerous such agricultural products retain their native names in the english and spanish lexicons the south american highlands were a center of early agriculture  genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species suggests that the potato has a single origin in the area of southern

catastrophe in of north america began practicing farming approximately 4,000  years ago  late in the archaic period of north american cultures  technology had advanced to the point that pottery was becoming common and the small-scale  felling of trees had become feasible  concurrently  the archaic indians began using fire in a controlled manner  intentional burning of vegetation was used to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories  it made travel easier and facilitated the growth of herbs and berry-producing  plants  which were important for both food and the mississippi river valley  europeans noted native americans  managed groves of nut and fruit trees not far from villages and towns and their gardens and agricultural fields  further away  prescribed burning would have been used in forest and prairie crops first domesticated by indigenous americans are now produced and used globally  chief among these is maize or  corn   arguably the most important crop in the other significant crops include cassava  chia  squash  pumpkins  zucchini  marrow  acorn squash  butternut squash   the pinto bean  phaseolus beans including most common beans  tepary beans and lima beans  tomatoes  potatoes  avocados  peanuts  cocoa beans  used to make chocolate   vanilla  strawberries  pineapples  peppers  species and varieties of capsicum

environmental management — including agro-forestry  practices among itza maya in guatemala and hunting and fishing among the menominee of wisconsin — suggest that longstanding  sacred values  may represent a summary of sustainable millennial practices in the americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where unrelated peoples adopted similar technologies and social organizations  an example of such a cultural area is mesoamerica  where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns  another well-known  example is the north american plains where until the 19th  century several peoples shared the traits of nomadic hunter-gatherers  based primarily on buffalo hunting the languages of the north american indians have been classified into 56  groups or stock tongues  in which the spoken languages of the tribes may be said to centre  in connection with speech  reference may be made to gesture language which was highly developed in parts of this area  of equal interest is the picture writing especially well developed among the chippewas and development of writing is counted among the many achievements and innovations of pre-columbian  american cultures  independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world  the mesoamerican region produced several indigenous writing systems beginning in the 1st  millennium bce  what may be the earliest-known  example in the americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the cascajal block  the olmec hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900  bce  around the time that olmec occupation of san lorenzo tenochtitlán began to maya writing system was a combination of phonetic syllabic symbols and logograms—that is  it was a logosyllabic writing system  it is the only pre-columbian  writing system known to represent completely the spoken language of its community  in total  the script has more than one thousand different glyphs  although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning  and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities  at any one time  no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use  some two hundred of which  including variations  had a phonetic or syllabic zapotec writing system is one of the earliest writing systems in the the oldest example of the zapotec script is a monument discovered in san josé mogote  dating from around from 600  zapotec writing was logographic and presumably the remains of the zapotec writing system are present in the monumental architecture  there are only a few extant inscriptions  making study of this writing system difficult aztec codices  singular codex  are books written by pre-columbian  and colonial-era  aztecs  these codices provide some of the best primary sources for aztec culture  the pre-columbian  codices differ from european codices in that they are largely pictorial  they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written the colonial era codices contain not only aztec pictograms  but also classical nahuatl  in the latin alphabet   spanish  and occasionally latin spanish mendicants in the sixteenth century taught indigenous scribes in their communities to write their languages in latin letters  and there are a large number of local-level  documents in nahuatl  zapotec  mixtec  and yucatec maya from the colonial era  many of which were part of lawsuits and other legal matters  although spaniards initially taught indigenous scribes alphabetic writing  the tradition became self-perpetuating  at the local the spanish crown gathered such documentation  and contemporary spanish translations were made for legal cases  scholars have translated and analyzed these documents in what is called the new philology to write histories of indigenous peoples from indigenous wiigwaasabak  birch bark scrolls on which the ojibwa  anishinaabe  people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes  can also be considered a form of writing  as can mi kmaq hieroglyphics aboriginal syllabic writing  or simply syllabics  is a family of abugidas used to write some aboriginal canadian languages of the algonquian  inuit  and athabaskan language families native american music in north america is almost entirely monophonic  but there are notable exceptions  traditional native american music often centers around drumming  rattles  clappersticks  and rasps were also popular percussive instruments  flutes were made of rivercane  cedar  and other woods  the tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends on the length of the wood used and the hand span of the intended player  but the finger holes are most often around a whole step apart and  at least in northern california  a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step  the apache fiddle is a single stringed needed the music of the indigenous peoples of central mexico and central america was often pentatonic  before the arrival of the spaniards and other europeans  music was inseparable from religious festivities and included a large variety of percussion and wind instruments such as drums  flutes  sea snail shells  used as a trumpet  and  rain  tubes  no remnants of pre-columbian  stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in guatemala  attributed to the maya of the late classic era (600–900  ce   which depicts a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced  this instrument is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the americas prior to the introduction of european musical instruments  when played  it produces a sound that mimics a jaguar s link visual arts by indigenous peoples of the americas comprise a major category in the world art collection  contributions include pottery  paintings  jewellery  weavings  sculptures  basketry  carvings  and because too many artists were posing as native americans and alaska in order to profit from the cachet of indigenous art in the united states

the area of the red river of the north  from the mid-17th  century after generations of first nations and native inuit married european settlers  they were small farmers  hunters and trappers  and usually catholic and the inuit had more limited interaction with european settlers during that early various laws  treaties  and legislation have been enacted between european-canadians  and first nations across canada  aboriginal right to self-government  provides the opportunity for first nations to manage their own historical  cultural  political  health care and economic control within their communities although not without conflict  european canadian early interactions in the east with first nations and inuit populations were relatively peaceful compared to the later experience of native peoples in the united combined with a late economic development in many this relatively peaceful history resulted in indigenous peoples having a fairly strong influence on the early national culture  while preserving their own from the late 18th  century  european canadians encouraged aboriginals to assimilate into the mainstream european-influenced  culture  which they referred to as

all territories in which they are spoken  and indigenous peoples are entitled to request some public services and documents in their native along with spanish  the law has granted them—more than 60  languages—the status of  national languages   the law includes all indigenous languages of the americas regardless of origin  that is  it includes the indigenous languages of ethnic groups non-native

there  most noticeably cuzcatlan  the pipil had no precious mineral resources  but they did have rich and fertile land that was good for farming  the spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in el salvador as they had in other lands like guatemala or mexico  but upon learning of the fertile land in el salvador  they attempted to conquer it  noted meso-american  indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the spanish included princes atonal and atlacatl of the pipil people in central el salvador and princess antu silan ulap of the lenca people in eastern el salvador  who saw the spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders  after fierce battles  the pipil successfully fought off the spanish army led by pedro de alvarado along with their mexican indian allies  the tlaxcalas   sending them back to guatemala  after many other attacks with an army reinforced with guatemalan indian allies  the spanish were able to conquer cuzcatlan  after further attacks  the spanish also conquered the lenca people  eventually  the spaniards intermarried with pipil and lenca women  resulting in the mestizo population which would become the majority of the salvadoran people  today many pipil and other indigenous populations live in the many small towns of el salvador like izalco  panchimalco  sacacoyo  and nahuizalco guatemala has one of the largest indigenous populations in central america  with approximately 39.3%  of the population considering themselves indigenous the indigenous demographic portion of guatemala’s population consists of majority mayan groups and one non-mayan  group  the mayan portion  can be broken down into 23  groups namely k’iche 11.3%,  kaqchikel 7.4%,  mam 5.5%,  q’eqchi’ 7.6%  and other 7.5%  the non-mayan  group consists of the xinca who are another set of indigenous people making up 0.5%  of the mayan tribes cover a vast geographic area throughout central america and expanding beyond guatemala into other countries  one could find vast groups of mayan people in boca costa  in the southern portions of guatemala  as well as the western highlands living together in close communities within these communities and outside of them  around 23  indigenous languages or amerindian languages are spoken as a first language  of these 23  languages  they only received official recognition by the government in 2003  under the

ilo convention 169  on indigenous and tribal peoples  is also known as convention 169    which is the only international law regarding indigenous peoples that independent countries can adopt  the convention  establishes that governments like guatemala’s must consult with indigenous groups prior to any projects occurring on tribal five percent of the population are of full-blooded  indigenous

concentration of indigenous in honduras are in the rural westernmost areas facing guatemala and to the caribbean sea coastline  as well on the nicaraguan the majority of indigenous people are lencas  miskitos to the east  mayans  pech  sumos  and 5%  of the nicaraguan population are indigenous  the largest indigenous group in nicaragua is the miskito people  their territory extended from cape camarón  honduras  to rio grande  nicaragua along the mosquito coast  there is a native miskito language  but large groups speak miskito coast creole  spanish  rama and other languages  the creole english came about through frequent contact with the british who colonized the area  many are christians  traditional miskito society was highly structured with a defined political structure  there was a king  but he did not have total power  instead  the power was split between himself  a governor  a general  and by the 1750s,  an admiral  historical information on kings is often obscured by the fact that many of the kings were semi-mythical.  another major group is the mayangna  or sumu  people  counting some 10,000  indigenous groups in nicaragua are located in the central and northern pacific area and they are self-identified  as follows  chorotega  cacaopera  or matagalpa   xiu-subtiaba  and 2005,  argentina s indigenous population  known as pueblos originarios  numbered about 600,329  (1.6%  of total population   this figure includes 457,363  people who self-identified  as belonging to an indigenous ethnic group and 142,966  who identified themselves as first-generation  descendants of an indigenous the ten most populous indigenous peoples are the mapuche (113,680  people   the kolla (70,505),  the toba (69,452),  the guaraní (68,454),  the wichi (40,036),  the diaguita–calchaquí (31,753),  the mocoví (15,837),  the huarpe (14,633),  the comechingón (10,863)  and the tehuelche (10,590).  minor but important peoples are the quechua (6,739),  the charrúa (4,511),  the pilagá (4,465),  the chané (4,376),  and the chorote (2,613).  the selknam  ona  people are now virtually extinct in its pure form  the languages of the diaguita  tehuelche  and selknam nations have become extinct or virtually extinct  the cacán language  spoken by diaguitas  in the 18th  century and the selknam language in the 20th  century  one tehuelche language  southern tehuelche  is still spoken by a handful of elderly people in bolivia  the 2001  census reported that 62%  of residents over the age of 15  identify as belonging to an indigenous people  some 3.7%  report growing up with an indigenous mother tongue but do not identify as when both of these categories are totaled  and children under 15,  some 66.4%  of bolivia s population was recorded as indigenous in the 2001  largest indigenous ethnic groups are  quechua  about 2.5  million people  aymara  2.0  million  chiquitano  181,000;  guaraní  126,000;  and mojeño  69,000.  some 124,000  belong to smaller indigenous the constitution of bolivia  enacted in 2009,  recognizes 36  cultures  each with its own language  as part of a pluri-national  state  some groups  including conamaq  the national council of ayllus and markas of qullasuyu   draw ethnic boundaries within the quechua-  and aymara-speaking  population  resulting in a total of 50  indigenous peoples native to bolivia large numbers of bolivian highland peasants retained indigenous language  culture  customs  and communal organization throughout the spanish conquest and the post-independence  period  they mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of  empowered caciques  to further communal organization  indigenous revolts took place frequently until while the national revolutionary movement government begun in 1952  discouraged people identifying as indigenous  reclassifying rural people as campesinos  or peasants   renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged  in the katarista movement beginning in the many lowland indigenous peoples  mostly in the east  entered national politics through the 1990  march for territory and dignity organized by the cidob confederation  that march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ilo convention 169  and to begin the still-ongoing  process of recognizing and giving official title to indigenous territories  the 1994  law of popular participation granted  grassroots territorial organizations   these are recognized by the state and have certain rights to govern local areas some radio and television programs are produced in the quechua and aymara languages  the constitutional reform in 1997  recognized bolivia as a multi-lingual,  pluri-ethnic  society and introduced education reform  in 2005,  for the first time in the country s history  an indigenous aymara  evo morales  was elected as president morales began work on his  indigenous autonomy  policy  which he launched in the eastern lowlands department on august 3,  2009.  bolivia was the first nation in the history of south america to affirm the right of indigenous people to speaking in santa cruz department  the president called it  a historic day for the peasant and indigenous movement   saying that  though he might make errors  he would  never betray the fight started by our ancestors and the fight of the bolivian a vote on further autonomy for jurisdictions took place in december 2009,  at the same time as general elections to office  the issue divided the that time  indigenous peoples voted overwhelmingly for more autonomy  five departments that had not already done so voted for as did gran chaco province in taríja  for regional and 11  of 12  municipalities that had referendums on this peoples of brazil make up 0.4%  of brazil s population  or about 817,000  people  but millions of brazilians are mestizo or have some indigenous indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of brazil  although in the 21st  century  the majority of them live in indigenous territories in the north and center-western  part of the country  on january 18,  2007,  fundação nacional do índio  funai  reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67  different uncontacted tribes in brazil  up from 40  in 2005.  brazil is now the nation that has the largest number of uncontacted tribes  and the island of new guinea is washington post reported in 2007,   as has been proved in the past when uncontacted tribes are introduced to other populations and the microbes they carry  maladies as simple as the common cold can be deadly  in the 1970s,  185  members of the panara tribe died within two years of discovery after contracting such diseases as flu and chickenpox  leaving only 69  to the 2012  census  10%  of the chilean population  including the rapa nui  a polynesian people  of easter island  was indigenous  although most show varying degrees of mixed many are descendants of the mapuche  and live in santiago  araucanía and the lake district  the mapuche successfully fought off defeat in the first 300–350  years of spanish rule during the arauco war  relations with the new chilean republic were good until the chilean state decided to occupy their lands  during the occupation of araucanía the mapuche surrendered to the country s army in the 1880s.  their land was opened to settlement by chileans and europeans  conflict over mapuche land rights continues to the present other groups include the aymara  the majority of whom live in bolivia and peru  with smaller numbers in the arica-parinacota  and tarapacá regions  and the atacama people  atacameños   who reside mainly in el loa a minority today within colombia s overwhelmingly mestizo and white colombian population  colombia s indigenous peoples consist of around 85  distinct cultures and more than 1,378,884  a variety of collective rights for indigenous peoples are recognized in the 1991  constitution one of the influences is the muisca culture  a subset of the larger chibcha ethnic group  famous for their use of gold  which led to the legend of el dorado  at the time of the spanish conquest  the muisca were the largest native civilization geographically between the incas and the aztecs empires there are over 114,000  inhabitants of native american origins  representing 2.4%  of the population  most of them live in secluded reservations  distributed among eight ethnic groups  quitirrisí  in the central valley   matambú or chorotega  guanacaste   maleku  northern alajuela   bribri  southern atlantic   cabécar  cordillera de talamanca   guaymí  southern costa rica  along the panamá border   boruca  southern costa rica  and ngäbe  southern costa rica  these native groups are characterized for their work in wood  like masks  drums and other artistic figures  as well as fabrics made of cotton their subsistence is based on agriculture  having corn  beans and plantains as the main crops ecuador was the site of many indigenous cultures  and civilizations of different proportions  an early sedentary culture  known as the valdivia culture  developed in the coastal region  while the caras and the quitus unified to form an elaborate civilization that ended at the birth of the capital quito  the cañaris near cuenca were the most advanced  and most feared by the inca  due to their fierce resistance to the incan expansion  their architecture remains were later destroyed by spaniards and the incas approximately 96.4%  of ecuador s indigenous population are highland quichuas living in the valleys of the sierra region  primarily consisting of the descendents of peoples conquered by the incas  they are kichwa speakers and include the caranqui  the otavalos  the cayambe  the quitu-caras,  the panzaleo  the chimbuelo  the salasacan  the tugua  the puruhá  the cañari  and the saraguro  linguistic evidence suggests that the salascan and the saraguro may have been the descendants of bolivian ethnic groups transplanted to ecuador as mitimaes coastal groups  including the awá  chachi  and the tsáchila  make up 0.24%  percent of the indigenous population  while the remaining 3.35  percent live in the oriente and consist of the oriente kichwa  the canelo and the quijos   the shuar  the huaorani  the siona-secoya,  the cofán  and the achuar in 1986,  indigenous people formed the first  truly  national political organization  the confederation of indigenous nationalities of ecuador  conaie  has been the primary political institution of the indigenous since then and is now the second largest political party in the nation  it has been influential in national politics  contributing to the ouster of presidents abdalá bucaram in 1997  and jamil mahuad in 2000.indigenous  population in peru make up around 30-45%  native peruvian traditions and customs have shaped the way peruvians live and see themselves today  cultural citizenship—or what renato rosaldo has called   the right to be different and to belong  in a democratic  participatory sense  (1996:243)—is  not yet very well developed in peru  this is perhaps no more apparent than in the country s amazonian regions where indigenous societies continue to struggle against state-sponsored  economic abuses  cultural discrimination  and pervasive venezuelans have some indigenous heritage and are pardo  even if they identify as white  but those who identify as indigenous  from being raised in those cultures  make up only around 2%  of the total population  the indigenous peoples speak around 29  different languages and many more dialects  as some of the ethnic groups are very small  their native languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades  the most important indigenous groups are the ye kuana  the wayuu  the pemon and the warao  the most advanced native people to have lived within the boundaries of present-day  venezuela is thought to have been the timoto-cuicas,  who lived mainly in the venezuelan andes  historians estimate that there were between 350  thousand and 500  thousand indigenous inhabitants at the time of spanish colonization  the most densely populated area was the andean region (timoto-cuicas),  thanks to their advanced agricultural techniques and ability to produce a surplus of food the 1999  constitution of venezuela gives the indigenous special rights  although the vast majority of them still live in very critical conditions of poverty  the government provides primary education in their languages in public schools to some of the largest groups  in efforts to continue the languages indigenous peoples make up the majority of the population in bolivia and peru  and are a significant element in most other former spanish colonies  exceptions to this include uruguay  native charrúa   according to the 2011  census  2.4%  of uruguayans reported having indigenous some governments recognize some of the major native american languages as official languages  quechua in peru and bolivia  aymara also in peru and bolivia  guarani in paraguay  and greenlandic in greenland in cuba  the population of amerindians includes 0.1  of the population and 0.2  part native which is also part of the population  many are from the taíno people or arawak people  when the spanish empire was in control of the island they used the natives as slaves and many died from diseases  hence decreasing the population  presently 0.3  of the population of cuba consists of part native and full-blooded  amerindians dominica is home to the carib territory  one of the last indigenous communities in the caribbean  the carib territory is home to an estimated 3,000  kalinago or carib people the native american name controversy relates to the dispute over acceptable ways to refer to the indigenous peoples of the americas and to broad subsets thereof  such as those living in a specific country or sharing certain cultural attributes  early settlers often adopted terms that some tribes used for each other  not realizing these were derogatory terms used by enemies  when discussing broader subsets of peoples  naming may be based on shared language  region  or historical relationship  many english exonyms have been used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the americas  some of these names were based on foreign-language  terms used by earlier explorers and colonists  while others resulted from the colonists  attempt to translate or transliterate endonyms from the native languages  other terms arose during periods of conflict between the colonizers and indigenous peoples since the late 20th  century  indigenous peoples in the americas have been more vocal about how they want to be addressed  pushing to suppress use of terms widely considered to be obsolete  inaccurate  or racist  during the latter half of the 20th  century and the rise of the indian rights movement  the united states government responded by proposing the use of the term  native american   to recognize the primacy of indigenous peoples  tenure in the nation  as may be expected among people of different cultures  not all native americans or american indians agree on its use  no single group naming convention has been accepted by all indigenous peoples  they prefer to be addressed as people of their tribe or nations since the late 20th  century  indigenous peoples in the americas have become more politically active in asserting their treaty rights and expanding their influence  some have organized in order to achieve some sort of self-determination  and preservation of their culturess  organizations such as the coordinator of indigenous organizations of the amazon river basin and the indian council of south america are examples of movements that are overcoming national borders to reunited indigenous populations  for instance those across the amazon basin  similar movements for indigenous rights can also be seen in canada and the united states  with movements like the international indian treaty council and the accession of native indian group into the unrepresented nations and peoples organization there has been a recognition of indigenous movements on an international scale  the membership of the united nations voted to adopt the declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples  despite dissent from some of the stronger countries of the americas in colombia  various indigenous groups have protested the denial of their rights  people organized a march in cali in october 2008  to demand the government live up to promises to protect indigenous lands  defend the indigenous against violence  and reconsider the free trade pact with the united first indigenous candidate to be democratically elected as head of a country in latin america was benito juárez  a zapotec mexican  he was elected president of mexico in morales  aymara people  was the first indigenous candidate elected as president of bolivia  in 2006,  and the first in south america  he has been twice re-elected.  his election encouraged the indigenous movement across latin america representatives from indigenous and rural organizations from major south american countries  including bolivia  ecuador  colombia  chile and brazil  started a forum in support of morales  legal process of change  the meeting condemned plans by the european  foreign power elite  to destabilize the country  the forum also expressed solidarity with morales and his economic and social changes in the interest of historically marginalized majorities  it questioned us interference through diplomats and ngos  the forum was suspicious of plots against bolivia and other countries that elected leftist leaders  including cuba  venezuela  ecuador  paraguay and forum rejected the supposed violent method used by regional civic leaders from the called  crescent departments  in bolivia to impose autonomous statutes  applauded the decision to expel the us ambassador to bolivia  and reaffirmed the sovereignty and independence of the presidency  amongst others  representatives of conaie  the national indigenous organization of colombia  the chilean council of all lands  and the brazilian landless movement participated in the history of indigenous peoples of the americas primarily focuses on human y-chromosome  dna haplogroups and human mitochondrial dna haplogroups  "y-dna"  is passed solely along the patrilineal line  from father to son  while  mtdna  is passed down the matrilineal line  from mother to offspring of both sexes  neither recombines  and thus y-dna  and mtdna change only by chance mutation at each generation with no intermixture between parents  genetic autosomal  atdna  markers are also used  but differ from mtdna or y-dna  in that they overlap atdna is generally used to measure the average continent-of-ancestry  genetic admixture in the entire human genome and related isolated evidence links indigenous americans to asian peoples  specifically siberian populations  such as the ket  selkup  chukchi and koryak peoples  indigenous peoples of the americas have been linked to north asian populations by the distribution of blood types  and in genetic composition as reflected by molecular data  such as there is general agreement among anthropologists that the source populations for the migration into the americas originated from an area somewhere east of the yenisei river  the common occurrence of the mtdna haplogroups a  b  c  and d among eastern asian and native american populations has long been as a whole  the greatest frequency of the four native american associated haplogroups occurs in the altai–baikal region of southern some subclades of c and d closer to the native american subclades occur among mongolian  amur  japanese  korean  and ainu studies of mitochondrial dna  mtdna  of amerindians and some siberian and central asian peoples also revealed that the gene pool of the turkic-speaking  peoples of siberia such as altaians  khakas  shors and soyots  living between the altai and lake baikal along the sayan mountains  are genetically close to needed  this view is shared by other researchers who argue that  the ancestors of the american indians were the first to separate from the great asian population in the middle 2012  research found evidence for a recent common ancestry between native americans and indigenous altaians based on mitochondrial dna and y-chromosome  the paternal lineages of altaians mostly belong to the subclades of haplogroup p-m45  (xr1a  xq1a  genetic pattern indicates indigenous peoples of the americas experienced two very distinctive genetic episodes  first with the initial peopling of the americas  and secondly with european colonization of the the former is the determinant factor for the number of gene lineages  zygosity mutations  and founding haplotypes present in today s indigenous peoples of the americas settlement of the new world occurred in stages from the bering sea coast line  with a possible initial layover of 10,000  to 20,000  years in beringia for the small founding the micro-satellite  diversity and distributions of the y lineage specific to south america indicates that certain indigenous peoples of the americas populations have been isolated

with various mtdna and atdna this suggests that the earliest migrants into the northern extremes of north america and greenland derived from later migrant 2013  study in nature reported that dna found in the 24,000-year-old  remains of a young boy from the archaeological mal'ta-buret'  culture suggest that up to one-third  of the indigenous americans may have ancestry that can be traced back to western eurasians  who may have  had a more north-easterly  distribution 24,000  years ago than commonly  we estimate that 14  to 38  percent of native american ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population   the authors wrote  professor kelly graf said our findings are significant at two levels  first  it shows that upper paleolithic siberians came from a cosmopolitan population of early modern humans that spread out of africa to europe and central and south asia  second  paleoindian skeletons like buhl woman with phenotypic traits atypical of modern-day  indigenous americans can be explained as having a direct historical connection to upper paleolithic siberia a route through beringia is seen as more likely than the solutrean kashani et al  2012  state that  the similarities in ages and geographical distributions for c4c  and the previously analyzed x2a  lineage provide support to the scenario of a dual origin for paleo-indians.  taking into account that c4c  is deeply rooted in the asian portion of the mtdna phylogeny and is indubitably of asian origin  the finding that c4c  and x2a  are characterized by parallel genetic histories definitively dismisses the controversial hypothesis of an atlantic glacial entry route into north africa asia europe north america oceania south america
