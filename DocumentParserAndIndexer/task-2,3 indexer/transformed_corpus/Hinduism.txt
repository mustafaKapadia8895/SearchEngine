currents  of the historical division into six darsanas  philosophies   two schools  vedanta and yoga  are currently the most classified by primary deity or deities  four major hinduism modern currents are vaishnavism  vishnu   shaivism  shiva   shaktism  devi  and smartism  five deities treated as hinduism also accepts numerous divine beings  with many hindus considering the deities to be aspects or manifestations of a single impersonal absolute or ultimate reality or god  while some hindus maintain that a specific deity represents the supreme and various deities are lower manifestations of

and right way of living  mcdaniel (2007)  classifies hinduism into six major kinds and numerous minor kinds  in order to understand expression of emotions among the the major kinds  according to mcdaniel are  folk hinduism  based on local traditions and cults of local deities and is the oldest  non-literate  system  vedic hinduism based on the earliest layers of the vedas traceable to 2nd  millennium bce  vedantic hinduism based on the philosophy of the upanishads  including advaita vedanta  emphasizing knowledge and wisdom  yogic hinduism  following the text of yoga sutras of patanjali emphasizing introspective awareness  dharmic hinduism or  daily morality   which mcdaniel states is stereotyped in some books as the  only form of hindu religion with a belief in karma  cows and caste   and bhakti or devotional hinduism  where intense emotions are elaborately incorporated in the pursuit of the distinguishes three hindu religions and four forms of hindu the three hindu religions are

de-emphasize  brahman priestly authority yet incorporate ritual grammar of brahmanic-sanskritic  he includes among  founded religions  buddhism  jainism  sikhism that are now distinct religions  syncretic movements such as brahmo samaj and the theosophical society  as well as various "guru-isms"  and new religious movements such as maharishi mahesh yogi and states that the attempt to classify hinduism by typology started in the imperial times  when proselytizing missionaries and colonial officials sought to understand and portray hinduism from their hinduism was construed as emanating not from a reason of spirit but fantasy and creative imagination  not conceptual but symbolical  not ethical but emotive  not rational or spiritual but of cognitive mysticism  this stereotype followed and fit  states inden  with the imperial imperatives of the era  providing the moral justification for the colonial from tribal animism to buddhism  everything was subsumed as part of hinduism  the early reports set the tradition and scholarly premises for typology of hinduism  as well as the major assumptions and flawed presuppositions that has been at the foundation of indology  hinduism  according to inden  has been neither what imperial religionists stereotyped it to be  nor is it appropriate to equate hinduism to be merely monist pantheism and philosophical idealism of advaita its adherents  hinduism is a traditional way of many practitioners refer to the  orthodox  form of hinduism as sanātana dharma   the eternal law  or the  eternal the sanskrit word dharma has a much deeper meaning than religion and is not its equivalent  all aspects of a hindu life  namely acquiring wealth  artha   fulfillment of desires  kama   and attaining liberation  moksha  are part of dharma which encapsulates the  right way of living  and eternal harmonious principles in their dharma refers to the  eternal  duties all hindus have to follow  regardless of class  caste  or sect  such as honesty  refraining from injuring living beings  purity  goodwill  mercy  patience  forbearance  self-restraint,  generosity  and asceticism  this is contrasted with svadharma  one s  own duty   the duties to

recently been used by hindu leaders  reformers  and nationalists to refer to hinduism as a unified world religion  sanatana dharma has thus become a synonym for the  eternal  truth and teachings of hinduism  the latter conceived of as not only transcendent of history and unchanging but also as indivisible and ultimately 1]beginning  in the 19th  century  indian modernists re-asserted  hinduism

mahatma rammohan roy is known as the father of the hindu he was a major influence on swami vivekananda (1863–1902),  who  according to flood  was  a figure of great importance in the development of a

consequence also gained greater popularity in this globalization of hindu culture brought  to the west teachings which have become an important cultural force in western societies  and which in turn

the beginning of the  epic and puranic  c q   preclassical  tolerance to variations in belief and its broad range of traditions make it difficult to define as a religion according to traditional western academics suggest that hinduism can be seen as a category with  fuzzy edges  rather than as a well-defined  and rigid entity  some forms of religious expression are central to hinduism and others  while not as central  still remain within the category  based on this idea ferro-luzzi  has developed a  prototype theory approach  to the definition of has been described as a tradition having a  complex  organic  multileveled and sometimes internally inconsistent hinduism does not have a  unified system of belief encoded in a declaration of faith or a but is rather an umbrella term comprising the plurality of religious phenomena of according to the supreme court of india unlike other religions in the world  the hindu religion does not claim any one prophet  it does not worship any one god  it does not believe in any one philosophic concept  it does not follow any one act of religious rites or performances  in fact  it does not satisfy the traditional features of a religion or creed  it is a way of life and nothing of the problem with a single definition of the term hinduism is the fact that hinduism does not have a it is a synthesis of various the  brahmanical orthopraxy  the renouncer traditions and popular or local hindu philosophies postulate a theistic ontology of creation  of sustenance  and of the destruction of the universe  yet some hindus are atheists  as they view hinduism more as philosophy than needed despite the differences  there is also a sense of most hindu traditions revere a body of religious or sacred literature  the although there are these texts are a reminder of the ancient cultural heritage and point of pride for with louis renou stating that  even in the most orthodox domains  the reverence to the vedas has come to be a simple raising of the states that  although shaivism and vaishaism may be regarded as "self-contained  religious there is a degree of interaction and reference between the  theoreticians and literary of each tradition which indicates the presence of  a wider sense of identity  a sense of coherence in a shared context and of inclusion in a common framework and notion of common denominators for several religions and traditions of india was already noted from the 12th  century ce lorenzen traces the emergence of a  family resemblance   and what he calls as  beginnings of medieval and modern hinduism  taking shape  at c  300-600  ce  with the development of the early puranas  and continuities with the earlier vedic lorenzen states that the establishment of a hindu self-identity  took place  through a process of mutual self-definition  with a contrasting muslim according to lorenzen  this  presence of the is necessary to recognise the  loose family resemblance  among the various traditions and to nicholson  already between the 12th  and the 16th  centuries  certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophical teachings of the upanishads  epics  puranas  and the schools known retrospectively as the  six systems   saddarsana  of mainstream hindu the tendency of  a blurring of philosophical distinctions  has also been noted by hacker called this and michaels speaks of  the identificatory lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct hindu identity in the interaction between muslims and and a process of  mutual self-definition  with a contrasting muslim 12]  which started well before michaels notes as a counteraction to islamic supremacy and as part of the continuing process of regionalization  two religious innovations developed in the hindu religions  the formation of sects and a historicization which preceded later nationalism and sometimes militant sect leaders  such as the marathi poet tukaram (1609-1649)  and ramdas (1608-1681),  articulated ideas in which they glorified hinduism and the past  the brahmins also produced increasingly historical texts  especially eulogies and chronicles of sacred sites  mahatmyas

a function of current human effort derived from free will and past human actions that set the ultimate goal of life  referred to as moksha  nirvana or samadhi  is understood in several different ways  as the realization of one s union with god  as the realization of one s eternal relationship with god  realization of the unity of all existence  perfect unselfishness and knowledge of the self  as the attainment of perfect mental peace  and as detachment from worldly desires  such realization liberates one from samsara  thereby ending the cycle of rebirth  sorrow and due to belief in the indestructibility of the death is deemed insignificant with respect to the cosmic meaning of moksha differs among the various hindu schools of thought  for example  advaita vedanta holds that after attaining moksha a person knows their  soul  self  and identifies it as one with brahman and everyone in all the followers of dvaita  dualistic  schools  in moksha state  identify individual  soul  self  as distinct from brahman but infinitesimally close  and after attaining moksha expect to spend eternity in a loka  heaven   to theistic schools of hinduism  moksha is liberation from samsara  while for other schools such as the monistic school  moksha is possible in current life and is a psychological concept  according to deutsche  moksha is transcendental consciousness to the latter  the perfect state of being  of self-realization,  of freedom and of  realizing the whole universe as the moksha in these schools of hinduism  suggests klaus implies a setting free of hitherto fettered faculties  a removing of obstacles to an unrestricted life  permitting a person to be more truly a person in the full sense  the concept presumes an unused human potential of creativity  compassion

man and man  man and animal  as well as man and nature  the vedic view does not see this competition  rather sees a unifying divinity that connects everyone and hindu scriptures refer to celestial entities called devas  or devī in feminine form  devatā used synonymously for deva in hindi   which may be translated into english as gods or heavenly 16]  the devas are an integral part of hindu culture and are depicted in art  architecture and through icons  and stories about them are related in the scriptures  particularly in indian epic poetry and the puranas  they are  however  often distinguished from ishvara  a personal god  with many hindus worshipping ishvara in one of its particular manifestations as their iṣṭa devatā  or chosen the choice is a matter of individual and of

particularly in the puranic literature after the 6th  century theologically  the reincarnation idea is most often associated with the avatars of hindu god vishnu  though the idea has been applied to other varying lists of avatars of vishnu appear in hindu scriptures  including the ten dashavatara of the garuda purana and the twenty-two  avatars in the bhagavata purana  though the latter adds that the incarnations of vishnu are the avatars of vishnu are important in vaishnavism theology  in the goddess-based  shaktism tradition of hinduism  avatars of the devi are found and all goddesses are considered to be different aspects of the same metaphysical and shakti while avatars of other deities such as ganesha and shiva are also mentioned in medieval hindu texts  this is minor and theistic and atheistic ideas  for epistemological and metaphysical reasons  are profuse in different schools of hinduism  the early nyaya school of hinduism  for example  was but later nyaya school scholars argued that god exists and offered proofs using its theory of other schools disagreed with nyaya scholars  and carvaka schools of hinduism  were non-theist/atheist,  arguing that  god was an unnecessary metaphysical its vaisheshika school started as another non-theistic  tradition relying on naturalism and that all matter is eternal  but it later introduced the concept of a non-creator  the yoga school of hinduism accepted the concept of a  personal god  and left it to the hindu to define his or her advaita vedanta taught a monistic  abstract self and oneness in everything  with no room for gods or deity  a perspective that mohanty calls   spiritual  not bhakti sub-schools  of vedanta taught a creator god that is distinct from each human to graham schweig  hinduism has the strongest presence of the divine feminine in world religion from ancient times to the the goddess is viewed as the heart of the most esoteric saiva and eternal truths play an important role in religious traditions and truths are believed to be contained in its sacred texts  which are accessed and taught by sages  gurus  saints or but there is also a strong tradition of the questioning of authority  internal debate and challenging of religious texts in hinduism  the hindus believe that this deepens the understanding of the eternal truths and further develops the tradition  authority  was mediated through an intellectual culture that tended to develop ideas collaboratively  and according to the shared logic of natural narratives in the upanishads present characters questioning persons of the kena upanishad repeatedly asks kena   by what  power something is the the katha upanishad and bhagavad gita present narratives where the student criticizes the teacher s inferior in the shiva purana  shiva questions vishnu and doubt plays a repeated role in the jayadeva s gita govinda presents criticism via the character of has no central doctrinal authority and many practising hindus do not claim to belong to any particular denomination or four major denominations are  however  used in scholarly studies  vaishnavism  shaivism  shaktism and these denominations differ primarily in the central deity worshipped  the traditions and the soteriological the denominations of hinduism  states lipner  are unlike those found in major religions of the world  because hindu denominations are fuzzy with individuals practicing more than one  and he suggests the term  hindu is the devotional religious tradition that worships and his avatars  particularly krishna and the adherents of this sect are generally non-ascetic,  monastic  oriented towards community events and devotionalism practices inspired by  intimate loving  joyous  playful  krishna and other vishnu these practices sometimes include community dancing  singing of kirtans and bhajans  with sound and music believed by some to have meditative and spiritual temple worship and festivals are typically elaborate in the bhagavad gita and the ramayana  along with vishnu-oriented  puranas provide its theistic philosophically  their beliefs are rooted in the dualism sub-schools  of vedantic is the tradition that focuses on shiva  shaivas are more attracted to ascetic individualism  and it has several their practices include bhakti-style  devotionalism  yet their beliefs lean towards nondual  monistic schools of hinduism such as advaita and some shaivas worship in temples  while others emphasize yoga  striving to be one with shiva avatars are uncommon  and some shaivas visualize god as half male  half female  as a fusion of the male and female principles  ardhanarishvara   shaivism is related to shaktism  wherein shakti is seen as spouse of community celebrations include festivals  and participation  with vaishnavas  in pilgrimages such as the kumbh shaivism has been more commonly practiced in the himalayan north from kashmir to nepal  and in south focuses on goddess worship of shakti or devi as cosmic and it is particularly common in northeastern and eastern states of india such as assam and bengal  devi is depicted as in gentler forms like parvati  the consort of shiva  or  as fierce warrior goddesses like kali and durga  followers of shaktism recognize shakti as the power that underlies the male principle  shaktism is also associated with tantra community celebrations include festivals  some of which include processions and idol immersion into sea or other water centers its worship simultaneously on all the major hindu deities  shiva  vishnu  shakti  ganesha  surya and the smarta tradition developed during the  early  classical period of hinduism around the beginning of the common era  when hinduism emerged from the interaction between brahmanism and local the smarta tradition is aligned with advaita vedanta  and regards adi shankara as its founder or reformer  who considered worship of god-with-attributes   saguna brahman  as a journey towards ultimately realizing god-without-attributes   nirguna brahman  atman  the term smartism is derived from smriti texts of hinduism  meaning those who remember the traditions in the this hindu sect practices a

into two  shruti and smriti  hindu scriptures were composed  memorized and transmitted verbally  across generations  for many centuries before they were written over many centuries  sages refined the teachings and expanded the shruti and smriti  as well as developed shastras with epistemological and metaphysical theories of six classical schools of hinduism shruti  lit  that which is primarily refers to the vedas  which form the earliest record of the hindu scriptures  and are regarded as eternal truths revealed to the ancient sages there are four vedas -  rigveda  samaveda  yajurveda and atharvaveda  each veda has been subclassified into four major text types – the samhitas  mantras and benedictions   the aranyakas  text on rituals  ceremonies  sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices),  the brahmanas  commentaries on rituals  ceremonies and sacrifices   and the upanishads  text discussing meditation  philosophy and spiritual the first two parts of the vedas were subsequently called the karmakāṇḍa  ritualistic portion   while the last two form the jñānakāṇḍa  knowledge portion  discussing spiritual insight and philosophical upanishads are the foundation of hindu philosophical thought  and have profoundly influenced diverse of the shrutis  vedic corpus   they alone are widely influential among hindus  considered scriptures par excellence of hinduism  and their central ideas have continued to influence its thoughts and sarvepalli radhakrishnan states that the upanishads have played a dominating role ever since their there are 108  muktikā upanishads in hinduism  of which
