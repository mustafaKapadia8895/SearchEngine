irish sea coasts in order of size the irish sea lies between the islands of ireland and great britain  listed below are islands in the irish sea which are over 1  km² in area  or which have a permanent population  anglesey is almost attached to holy island  holy island is included separately the most accessible and possibly the greatest wildlife resource of the irish sea lies in its estuaries  particularly the dee estuary  the mersey estuary  the ribble estuary  morecambe bay  the solway firth  loch ryan  the firth of clyde  belfast lough  strangford lough  carlingford lough  dundalk bay  dublin bay and wexford harbour  however  a lot of wildlife also depends on the cliffs  salt marshes and sand dunes of the adjoining shores  the seabed and the open sea itself the information on the invertebrates of the seabed of the irish sea is rather patchy because it is difficult to survey such a large area  where underwater visibility is often poor and information often depends upon looking at material brought up from the seabed in mechanical grabs  however  the groupings of animals present depend to a large extent on whether the seabed is composed of rock  boulders  gravel  sand  mud or even peat  in the soft sediments seven types of community have been provisionally identified  variously dominated by brittle-stars,  sea urchins  worms  mussels  tellins  furrow-shells,  and tower-shells.parts  of the bed of the irish sea are very rich in wildlife  the seabed southwest of the isle of man is particularly noted for its rarities and as are the horse mussel beds of strangford lough  scallops and queen scallops are found in more gravelly areas  in the estuaries  where the bed is more sandy or muddy  the number of species is smaller but the size of their populations is larger  brown shrimp  cockles and edible mussels support local fisheries in morecambe bay and the dee estuary and the estuaries are also important as nurseries for flatfish  herring and sea bass  muddy seabeds in deeper waters are home to populations of the dublin bay prawn  also known as open sea is a complex habitat in its own right  it exists in three spatial dimensions and also varies over time and tide  for example  where freshwater flows into the irish sea in river estuaries its influence can extend far offshore as the freshwater is lighter and  floats  on top of the much larger body of saltwater until wind and temperature changes mix it in  similarly  warmer water is less dense and seawater warmed in the inter-tidal  zone may  float  on the colder offshore water  the amount of light penetrating the seawater also varies with depth and turbidity  this leads to differing populations of plankton in different parts of the sea and varying communities of animals that feed on these populations  however  increasing seasonal storminess leads to greater mixing of water and tends to break down these divisions  which are more apparent when the weather is calm for long periods plankton includes bacteria  plants  phytoplankton  and animals  zooplankton  that drift in the sea  most are microscopic  but some  such as the various species of jellyfish and sea gooseberry  can be much bigger diatoms and dinoflagellates dominate the phytoplankton  although they are microscopic plants  diatoms have hard shells and dinoflagellates have little tails that propel them through the water  phytoplankton populations in the irish sea have a spring  bloom  every april and may  when the seawater is generally at its greenest crustaceans  especially copepods  dominate the zooplankton  however  many animals of the seabed  the open sea and the seashore spend their juvenile stages as part of the zooplankton  the whole plankton  soup  is vitally important  directly or indirectly  as a food source for most species in the irish sea  even the largest  the enormous basking shark  for example  lives entirely on plankton and the leatherback turtle s main food is jellyfish a colossal diversity of invertebrate species live in the irish sea and its surrounding coastline  ranging from flower-like  fan-worms  to predatory swimming crabs to large chameleon-like  some of the most significant for other wildlife are the reef-building  species like the inshore horse mussel of strangford lough and the inter-tidal  honeycomb worm of morecambe bay  cumbria and lancashire  these build up large structures over many years and  in turn  provide surfaces  nooks and crannies where other marine animals and plants may become established and live out some or all of their lives there are quite regular records of live and stranded leatherback turtle in and around the irish sea  this species travels north to the waters off the british isles every year following the swarms of jellyfish that form its prey  loggerhead turtle  ridley sea turtle and green turtle are found very occasionally in the irish sea but are generally unwell or dead when discovered  they have strayed or been swept out of their natural range further south into colder estuaries of the irish sea are of international importance for birds  they are vital feeding grounds on migration flyways for shorebirds travelling between the arctic and africa  others depend on the milder climate as a refuge when continental europe is in the grip of species of seabird are reported as regularly nesting on beaches or cliffs around the irish sea  huge populations of the sea duck  common scoter  spend winters feeding in shallow waters off eastern ireland  lancashire and north dolphins and porpoises all frequent the irish sea  but knowledge of how many there may be and where they go is somewhat sketchy  about a dozen species have been recorded since 1980,  but only three are seen fairly often  these are the harbour porpoise  bottlenose dolphin and common dolphin  the more rarely seen species are minke whale  fin whale  sei whale  humpback whale  north atlantic right which are now considered to be almost extinct in eastern north atlantic  sperm whale  northern bottlenose whale  long-finned  pilot whale  orca  white-beaked  dolphin  striped dolphin and risso s in 2005,  a plan to reintroduce grey whales by airlifting 50  of them from the pacific ocean to the irish sea was claimed to be logically and ethically it had not been implemented by 2013.the  common or harbour seal and the grey

hilbre and walney islands  merseyside  the wirral  st annes  barrow-in-furness  borough  and irish sea has been described by greenpeace as the most radioactively contaminated sea in the world with some  eight million litres of nuclear waste  discharged into it each day from sellafield reprocessing plants  contaminating seawater  sediments and marine radioactive waste has been discharged into the irish sea as part of operations at sellafield since 1952.  the rate of discharge began to accelerate in the mid-  to late 1960s,  reaching a peak in the 1970s  and generally declining significantly since then  as an example of this profile  discharges of plutonium  specifically 241pu)  peaked in 1973  at 2,755  terabecquerels (74,500  falling to 8.1  tbq (220  ci  by improvements in the treatment of waste in 1985  and 1994  resulted in further reductions in radioactive waste discharge although the subsequent processing of a backlog resulted in increased discharges of certain types of radioactive waste  discharges of technetium in particular rose from 6.1  tbq (160  ci  in 1993  to a peak of 192  tbq (5,200  ci  in 1995  before dropping back to 14  tbq (380  ci  in in total 22  petabecquerels (590  kci  of 241pu  was discharged over the period 1952  to current rates of discharge for many radionuclides are at least 100  times lower than they were in the of the distribution of radioactive contamination after discharge reveals that mean sea currents result in much of the more soluble elements such as caesium being flushed out of the irish sea through the north channel about a year after discharge  measurements of technetium concentrations post-1994  has produced estimated transit times to the north channel of around six months with peak concentrations off the northeast irish coast occurring 18–24  months after peak discharge  less soluble elements such as plutonium are subject to much slower redistribution  whilst concentrations have declined in line with the reduction in discharges they are markedly higher in the eastern irish sea compared to the western areas  the dispersal of these elements is closely associated with sediment activity  with muddy deposits on the seabed acting as sinks  soaking up an estimated 200  kg (440  lb  of the highest concentration is found in the eastern irish sea in sediment banks lying parallel to the cumbrian coast  this area acts as a significant source of wider contamination as radionuclides are dissolved once again  studies have revealed that 80%  of current sea water contamination by caesium is sourced from sediment banks  whilst plutonium levels in the western sediment banks between the isle of man and the irish coast are being maintained by contamination redistributed from the eastern sediment banks the consumption of seafood harvested from the irish sea is the main pathway for exposure of humans to the environmental monitoring report for the period 2003  to 2005  published by the radiological protection institute of ireland  rpii  reported that in 2005  average quantities of radioactive contamination found in seafood ranged from less than 1  bq kg (12  pci lb  for fish to

recoverable hydrocarbon reserves from eight producing fields  dti  2001),  the east irish sea basin is at a mature exploration phase  early namurian basinal mudstones are the source rocks for these hydrocarbons  production from all fields is from fault-bounded  traps of the lower triassic formation  principally the aeolian sherwood sandstone reservoir  top-sealed  by younger triassic continental mudstones and evaporites  future mineral exploration will initially concentrate on extending this play  but there remains largely untested potential also for gas and oil within widespread carboniferous fluvial sandstone reservoirs  this play requires intraformational mudstone seal units to be present  as there is no top-seal  for reservoirs subcropping the regional base permian unconformity in the east of the basin  and carboniferous strata crop out at the sea bed in the west the caernarfon bay basin contains up to 7  cubic kilometres (1.7  cu mi  of permian and triassic

undrilled targets in tilted fault block plays  as in the east irish sea basin  the principal target reservoir is the lower triassic  sherwood sandstone  top-sealed  by younger triassic mudstones and evaporites  wells in the irish sector to the west have demonstrated that pre-rift,  westphalian coal measures are excellent hydrocarbon source rocks  and are at peak maturity for gas generation  maddox et al   1995).  seismic profiles clearly image these strata continuing beneath a basal permian unconformity into at least the western part of the caernarfon bay basin the timing of gas generation presents the greatest exploration risk  maximum burial of  and primary gas migration from  the source rocks could have terminated as early as the jurassic  whereas many of the tilted fault blocks were reactivated or created during paleogene inversion of the basin  however  it is also possible that a secondary gas charge occurred during regional heating associated with intrusion of paleogene dykes  such as those that crop out nearby on the coastline of north wales   floodpage et al   1999)  have invoked this second phase of paleogene hydrocarbon generation as an important factor in the charging of the east irish sea basin s oil and gas fields  it is not clear as yet whether aeromagnetic anomalies in the southeast of caernarfon bay are imaging a continuation of the dyke swarm into this area too  or whether they are instead associated with deeply buried permian syn-rift  volcanics  alternatively  the fault block traps could have been recharged by exsolution of methane from formation brines as a direct result of the tertiary uplift  cf  doré and jensen  1996).the  cardigan bay basin forms a continuation into british waters of ireland s north celtic sea basin  which has two producing gas fields  the basin comprises a south-easterly  deepening half-graben  near the welsh coastline  although its internal structure becomes increasingly complex towards the southwest

paleogene fluvio-deltaic  sediments  the basin has a proven petroleum system  with potentially producible gas reserves at the dragon discovery near the uk roi median line  and oil shows in a further three wells  the cardigan bay basin contains multiple reservoir targets  which include the lower triassic  sherwood sandstone   middle jurassic shallow marine sandstones and limestone  great oolite   and upper jurassic fluvial sandstone  the reservoir for the dragon discovery the most likely hydrocarbon source rocks are early jurassic marine mudstones  these are fully mature for oil generation in the west of the british sector  and are mature for gas generation nearby in the irish sector  gas-prone,  westphalian pre-rift  coal measures may also be present at depth locally  the cardigan bay basin was subjected to two tertiary phases of compressive uplift  whereas maximum burial that terminated primary hydrocarbon generation was probably around the end of the cretaceous  or earlier if cretaceous strata  now missing  were never deposited in the basin  despite the tertiary structuration  the dragon discovery has proved that potentially commercial volumes of hydrocarbons were retained at least locally in cardigan bay  in addition to undrilled structural traps  the basin contains untested potential for stratigraphic entrapment of hydrocarbons near synsedimentary faults  especially in the middle jurassic liverpool bay development is bhp billiton petroleum s largest operated asset  it comprises the integrated development of five offshore oil and gas fields in the irish sea oil is produced from the lennox and douglas fields  it is then treated at the douglas complex and piped 17  km (11  mi  to an oil storage barge ready for export by tankers  gas is produced from the hamilton  hamilton north and hamilton east reservoirs  after initial processing at the douglas complex the gas is piped by subsea pipeline to the point of ayr gas terminal for further processing  the gas is

has confirmed the potential for petroleum generation with oil shows seen in a number of wells together with natural hydrocarbon seeps recorded from airborne surveys  new analysis of vintage 2-d  seismic data has revealed the presence of a large undrilled structural closure at lower triassic level situated about 10  kilometres (6  mi  offshore dublin  this feature  known as the dalkey island exploration prospect  may be prospective for oil  as there are prolific oil productive lower triassic reservoirs nearby in the eastern irish sea offshore liverpool  whilst the dalkey island exploration prospect could contain about 870  million barrels (140,000,000  m3)  of oil in place  this undrilled prospect still has significant risk and the partners are currently advancing a focused work programme in order to better understand and hopefully mitigate these risks  however  given its location in shallow water and close proximity to shore  the prospect is of great interest as exploration drilling  together with any future development costs  are likely to be needed discussions of linking britain to ireland began in with an application for £15,000  towards the cost of
