 a desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life  the lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation  about one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid.  this includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or  cold deserts   deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls  by the temperature that prevails  by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces  although rain seldom occurs in deserts  there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods  rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind  this picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms  wind-blown  sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface  rocks are smoothed down  and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits  the grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes  other deserts are flat  stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones  these areas are known as desert pavements and little further erosion takes place  other desert features include rock outcrops  exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water  temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate  there may be underground sources of water in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers  where these are found  oases can occur plants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment  plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves  water-resistant  cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory  some annual plants germinate  bloom and die in the course of a few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived  plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture  animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive  many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day  they tend to be efficient at conserving water  extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine  some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods  ready to become active again when the rare rains fall  they then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy people have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid  lands for millennia  nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life  the cultivation of semi-arid  regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of increased desertification  desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation and the imperial valley in california provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source  many trade routes have been forged across deserts  especially across the sahara desert  and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt  gold  ivory and other goods  large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the sahara  some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy english desert and its romance cognates  including italian and portuguese deserto  french désert and spanish desierto  all come from the ecclesiastical latin dēsertum  originally  an abandoned place    a participle of dēserere   to the correlation between aridity and sparse population is complex and dynamic  varying by culture  era  and technologies  thus the use of the word desert can cause confusion  in english before the 20th  century  desert was often used in the sense of  unpopulated area   without specific reference to but today the word is most often used in its climate-science  sense  an area of low phrases such as  desert and  great american desert  in previous centuries did not necessarily imply sand or aridity  their focus was the sparse desert is a region of land that is very dry because it receives low amounts of precipitation  usually in the form of rain but may be snow  mist or fog   often has little coverage by plants  and in which streams dry up unless they are supplied by water from outside the deserts generally receive less than 250  mm (10  in  of precipitation each the potential evapotranspiration may be large but  in the absence of available water  the actual evapotranspiration may be close to semideserts are regions which receive between 250  and 500  mm (10  and 20  in  and when clad in grass  these are known as have been defined and classified in a number of ways  generally combining total precipitation  number of days on which this falls  temperature  and humidity  and sometimes additional for example  phoenix  arizona  receives less than 250  mm (9.8  in  of precipitation per year  and is immediately recognized as being located in a desert because of its aridity-adapted  plants  the north slope of alaska s brooks range also receives less than 250  mm (9.8  in  of precipitation per year and is often classified as a cold other regions of the world have cold deserts  including areas of the and other high-altitude  areas in other parts of the polar deserts cover much of the ice-free  areas of the arctic and a non-technical  definition is that deserts are those parts of the earth s surface that have insufficient vegetation cover to support a human evapotranspiration supplements the measurement of precipitation in providing a scientific measurement-based  definition of a desert  the water budget of an area can be calculated using the formula p − pe ± s  wherein p is precipitation  pe is potential evapotranspiration rates and s is amount of surface storage of water  evapotranspiration is the combination of water loss through atmospheric evaporation and through the life processes of plants  potential evapotranspiration  then  is the amount of water that could evaporate in any given region  as an example  tucson  arizona receives about 300  mm (12  in  of rain per year  however about 2,500  mm (98  in  of water could evaporate over the course of a in other words  about eight times more water could evaporate from the region than actually falls as rain  rates of evapotranspiration in cold regions such as alaska are much lower because of the lack of heat to aid in the evaporation are sometimes classified as  hot  or  cold    semiarid  or the characteristics of hot deserts include high temperatures in summer  greater evaporation than precipitation usually exacerbated by high temperatures  strong winds and lack of cloud cover  considerable variation in the occurrence of precipitation  its intensity and distribution  and low humidity  winter temperatures vary considerably between different deserts and are often related to the location of the desert on the continental landmass and the latitude  daily variations in temperature can be as great as 22  °c (40  °f  or more  with heat loss by radiation at night being increased by the clear deserts  sometimes known as temperate deserts  occur at higher latitudes than hot deserts  and the aridity is caused by the dryness of the air  some cold deserts are far from the ocean and others are separated by mountain ranges from the sea and in both cases there is insufficient moisture in the air to cause much precipitation  the largest of these deserts are found in central asia  others occur on the eastern side of the rocky mountains  the eastern side of the southern andes and in southern polar deserts are a particular class of cold desert  the air is very cold and carries little moisture so little precipitation occurs and what does fall  usually as snow  is carried along in the often strong wind and may form blizzards  drifts and dunes similar to those caused by dust and sand in other desert regions  in antarctica  for example  the annual precipitation is about 50  mm (2  in  on the central plateau and some ten times that amount on some major on precipitation alone  hyperarid deserts receive less than 25  mm (1  in  of rainfall a year  they have no annual seasonal cycle of precipitation and experience twelve-month  periods with no rainfall at arid deserts receive between 25  and 200  mm (1  and 8  in  in a year and semiarid deserts between 200  and 500  mm (8  and 20  in   however  such factors as the temperature  humidity  rate of evaporation and evapotranspiration  and the moisture storage capacity of the ground have a marked effect on the degree of aridity and the plant and animal life that can be sustained  rain falling in the cold season may be more effective at promoting plant growth  and defining the boundaries of deserts and the semiarid regions that surround them on the grounds of precipitation alone is semi-arid  desert or a steppe is a version of the arid desert with much more rainfall  vegetation and higher humidity  these regions feature a semi-arid  climate and are less extreme than regular like arid deserts  temperatures can vary greatly in semi deserts  they share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas  they usually receive precipitation from 250  mm (10  in  to 500  mm (20  in  but this can vary due to evapotranspiration and soil nutrition  semi deserts can be found in the tabernas desert  and some of the spanish plateau   the sahel  the eurasian steppe  most of central asia  the western us  most of northern mexico  portions of south america  especially in argentina  and the australian they usually feature bsh  hot steppe  or bsk  temperate steppe  in the köppen climate classification coastal deserts are mostly found on the western edges of continental land masses in regions where cold currents approach the land or cold water upwellings rise from the ocean depths  the cool winds crossing this water pick up little moisture and the coastal regions have low temperatures and very low rainfall  the main precipitation being in the form of fog and dew  the range of temperatures on a daily and annual scale is relatively low  being 11  °c (20  °f  and 5  °c (9  °f  respectively in the atacama desert  deserts of this type are often long and narrow and bounded to the east by mountain ranges  they occur in namibia  chile  southern california and baja california  other coastal deserts influenced by cold currents are found in western australia  the arabian peninsula and horn of africa  and the western fringes of the 1961,  peveril meigs divided desert regions on earth into three categories according to the amount of precipitation they received  in this now widely accepted system  extremely arid lands have at least twelve consecutive months without precipitation  arid lands have less than 250  mm (10  in  of annual precipitation  and semiarid lands have a mean annual precipitation of between 250  and 500  mm (10–20  in   both extremely arid and arid lands are considered to be deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are are also classified  according to their geographical location and dominant weather pattern  as trade wind  mid-latitude,  rain shadow  coastal  monsoon  or polar trade wind deserts occur either side of the horse latitudes at 30°  to 35°  north and south  these belts are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large-scale  descent of dry air moving from high-altitudes  toward the poles  the sahara desert is of this mid-latitude  deserts occur between 30°  and 50°  north and south  they are mostly in areas remote from the sea where most of the moisture has already precipitated from the prevailing winds  they include the tengger and sonoran monsoon deserts are similar  they occur in regions where large temperature differences occur between sea and land  moist warm air rises over the land  deposits its water content and circulates back to sea  further inland  areas receive very little precipitation  the thar desert near the india pakistan border is of this some parts of the world  deserts are created by a rain shadow effect  orographic lift occurs as air masses rise to pass over high ground  in the process they cool and lose much of their moisture by precipitation on the windward slope of the mountain range  when they descend on the leeward side  they warm and their capacity to hold moisture increases so an area with relatively little precipitation the taklamakan desert is an example  lying in the rain shadow of the himalayas and receiving less than 38  mm (1.5  in  precipitation other areas are arid by virtue of being a very long way from the nearest available sources of deserts are arid places with a very high altitude  the most prominent example is found north of the himalayas  in the kunlun mountains and the tibetan plateau  many locations within this category have elevations exceeding 3,000  m (9,800  ft  and the thermal regime can be hemiboreal  these places owe their profound aridity  the average annual precipitation is often less than 40  mm or 1.5  in  to being very far from the nearest available sources of moisture and are often in the lee of mountain ranges  montane deserts are normally cold  or may be scorchingly hot by day and very cold by night as is true of the northeastern slopes of mount deserts such as mcmurdo dry valleys remain ice-free  because of the dry katabatic winds that flow downhill from the surrounding former desert areas presently in non-arid  environments  such as the sandhills in nebraska  are known as in the köppen climate classification system  deserts are classed as bwh  hot desert  or bwk  temperate desert   in the thornthwaite climate classification system  deserts would be classified as arid megathermal usually have a large diurnal and seasonal temperature range  with high daytime temperatures falling sharply at night  the diurnal range may be as much as 20  to 30  °c (36  to 54  °f  and the rock surface experiences even greater temperature during the day the sky is usually clear and most of the sun s radiation reaches the ground  but as soon as the sun sets  the desert cools quickly by radiating heat into space  in hot deserts  the temperature during daytime can exceed 45  °c (113  °f  in summer and plunge below freezing point at night during large temperature variations have a destructive effect on the exposed rocky surfaces  the repeated fluctuations put a strain on exposed rock and the flanks of mountains crack and shatter  fragmented strata slide down into the valleys where they continue to break into pieces due to the relentless sun by day and chill by night  successive strata are exposed to further weathering  the relief of the internal pressure that has built up in rocks that have been underground for aeons can cause them to exfoliation also occurs when the outer surfaces of rocks split off in flat flakes  this is believed to be caused by the stresses put on the rock by repeated expansions and contractions which induces fracturing parallel to the original chemical weathering processes probably play a more important role in deserts than was previously thought  the necessary moisture may be present in the form of dew or mist  ground water may be drawn to the surface by evaporation and the formation of salt crystals may dislodge rock particles as sand or disintegrate rocks by exfoliation  shallow caves are sometimes formed at the base of cliffs by this the desert mountains decay  large areas of shattered rock and rubble occur  the process continues and the end products are either dust or sand  dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder granites  limestone and there is a certain critical size  about 0.5  mm  below which further temperature-induced  weathering of rocks does not occur and this provides a minimum size for sand the mountains are eroded  more and more sand is created  at high wind speeds  sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along  a process known as saltation  the whirling airborne grains act as a sand blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the the sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields  or sand-seas,  or piled up in and dust storms are natural events that occur in arid regions where the land is not protected by a covering of vegetation  dust storms usually start in desert margins rather than the deserts themselves where the finer materials have already been blown away  as a steady wind begins to blow  fine particles lying on the exposed ground begin to vibrate  at greater wind speeds  some particles are lifted into the air stream  when they land  they strike other particles which may be jerked into the air in their turn  starting a chain reaction  once ejected  these particles move in one of three possible ways  depending on their size  shape and density  suspension  saltation or creep  suspension is only possible for particles less than 0.1  mm (0.004  in  in diameter  in a dust storm  these fine particles are lifted up and wafted aloft to heights of up to 6  km (3.7  mi   they reduce visibility and can remain in the atmosphere for days on end  conveyed by the trade winds for distances of up to 6,000  km (3,700  denser clouds of dust can be formed in stronger winds  moving across the land with a billowing leading edge  the sunlight can be obliterated and it may become as dark as night at ground in a study of a dust storm in china in 2001,  it was estimated that 6.5  million tons of dust were involved  covering an area of 134,000,000  km2  (52,000,000  sq mi   the mean particle size was 1.44  a much smaller scale  short-lived  phenomenon can occur in calm conditions when hot air near the ground rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler  low-pressure  air above forming a whirling column of particles  a dust occur with much less frequency than dust storms  they are often preceded by severe dust storms and occur when the wind velocity increases to a point where it can lift heavier particles  these grains of sand  up to about 0.5  mm (0.020  in  in diameter are jerked into the air but soon fall back to earth  ejecting other particles in the process  their weight prevents them from being airborne for long and most only travel a distance of a few meters  yards   the sand streams along above the surface of the ground like a fluid  often rising to heights of about 30  cm (12  in a really severe steady blow  2  m (6  ft 7  in  is about as high as the sand stream can rise as the largest sand grains do not become airborne at all  they are transported by creep  being rolled along the desert floor or performing short a sandstorm  the wind-blown  sand particles become electrically charged  such electric fields  which range in size up to 80  kv m  can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment  they are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and the electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground  the mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a negative charge when their diameter is under 250  μm and a positive one when they are over 500  take up about one third of the earth s land bottomlands may be salt-covered  flats  eolian processes are major factors in shaping desert landscapes  polar deserts  also seen as  cold deserts   have similar features  except the main form of precipitation is snow rather than rain  antarctica is the world s largest cold desert  composed of about 98%  thick continental ice sheet and 2%  barren rock   some of the barren rock is to be found in the so-called  dry valleys of antarctica that almost never get snow  which can have ice-encrusted  saline lakes that suggest evaporation far greater than the rare snowfall due to the strong katabatic winds that even evaporate ice deserts  both hot and cold  play a part in moderating the earth s temperature  this is because they reflect more of the incoming light and their albedo is higher than that of forests or the people think of deserts as consisting of extensive areas of billowing sand dunes because that is the way they are often depicted on tv and in but deserts do not always look like across the world  around 20%  of desert is sand  varying from only 2%  in north america to 30%  in australia and over 45%  in central where sand does occur  it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of sand sheet is a near-level,  firm expanse of partially consolidated particles in a layer that varies from a few centimeters to a few meters thick  the structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand  separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel  which are a single grain thick  these larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24  km h (15  mph   they form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow  the distance between their crests corresponds to the average length of jumps made by particles during saltation  the ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to dunes are accumulations of windblown sand piled up in mounds or ridges  they form downwind of copious sources of dry  loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle  as the wind blows  saltation and creep take place on the windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill  when they reach the crest  they cascade down the far side  the upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10°  to 20°  while the lee slope is around 32°,  the angle at which loose dry sand will slip  as this wind-induced  movement of sand grains takes place  the dune moves slowly across the surface of the dunes are sometimes solitary  but they are more often grouped together in dune fields  when these are extensive  they are known as sand seas or shape of the dune depends on the characteristics of the prevailing wind  barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface  and are crescent-shaped  with the concave side away from the wind  when there are two directions from which winds regularly blow  a series of long  linear dunes known as seif dunes may form  these also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction  transverse dunes run at a right angle to the prevailing wind direction  star dunes are formed by variable winds  and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point  they tend to grow vertically  they can reach a height of 500  m (1,600  ft   making them the tallest type of dune  rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes  found on the upwind edges of sand large part of the surface area of the world s deserts consists of flat  stone-covered  plains dominated by wind erosion  in  eolian deflation   the wind continually removes fine-grained  material  which becomes wind-blown  sand  this exposes coarser-grained  material  mainly pebbles with some larger stones or leaving a desert pavement  an area of land overlaid by closely packed smooth stones forming a tessellated mosaic  different theories exist as to how exactly the pavement is formed  it may be that after the sand and dust is blown away by the wind the stones jiggle themselves into place  alternatively  stones previously below ground may in some way work themselves to the surface  very little further erosion takes place after the formation of a pavement  and the ground becomes stable  evaporation brings moisture to the surface by capillary action and calcium salts may be precipitated  binding particles together to form a desert in time  bacteria that live on the surface of the stones accumulate a film of minerals and clay particles  forming a shiny brown coating known as desert non-sandy  deserts consist of exposed outcrops of bedrock  dry soils or aridisols  and a variety of landforms affected by flowing water  such as alluvial fans  sinks or playas  temporary or permanent lakes  and a hamada is a type of desert landscape consisting of a high rocky plateau where the sand has been removed by aeolian processes  other landforms include plains largely covered by gravels and angular boulders  from which the finer particles have been stripped by the wind  these are called  reg  in the western sahara   serir  in the eastern sahara   gibber plains  in australia and  saï  in central the tassili plateau in algeria is an impressive jumble of eroded sandstone outcrops  canyons  blocks  pinnacles  fissures  slabs and ravines  in some places the wind has carved holes or arches and in others it has created mushroom-like  pillars narrower at the base than the in the colorado plateau it is water that has been the eroding force  here the colorado river has cut its way over the millennia through the high desert floor creating a canyon that is over a mile (6,000  feet or 1,800  meters  deep in places  exposing strata that are over two billion year of the driest places on earth is the atacama it is virtually devoid of life because it is blocked from receiving precipitation by the andes mountains to the east and the chilean coast range to the west  the cold humboldt current and the anticyclone of the pacific are essential to keep the dry climate of the atacama  the average precipitation in the chilean region of antofagasta is just 1  mm (0.039  in  per year  some weather stations in the atacama have never received rain  evidence suggests that the atacama may not have had any significant rainfall from 1570  to 1971.  it is so arid that mountains that reach as high as 6,885  m (22,589  ft  are completely free of glaciers and  in the southern part from 25°s  to 27°s,  may have been glacier-free  throughout the quaternary  though permafrost extends down to an altitude of 4,400  m (14,400  ft  and is continuous above 5,600  m (18,400  nevertheless  there is some plant life in the atacama  in the form of specialist plants that obtain moisture from dew and the fogs that blow in from the rain falls in deserts  as it occasionally does  it is often with great violence  the desert surface is evidence of this with dry stream channels known as arroyos or wadis meandering across its surface  these can experience flash floods  becoming raging torrents with surprising rapidity after a storm that may be many kilometers away  most deserts are in basins with no drainage to the sea but some are crossed by exotic rivers sourced in mountain ranges or other high rainfall areas beyond their borders  the river nile  the colorado river and the yellow river do this  losing much of their water through evaporation as they pass through the desert and raising groundwater levels nearby  there may also be underground sources of water in deserts in the form of springs  aquifers  underground rivers or lakes  where these lie close to the surface  wells can be dug and oases may form where plant and animal life can the nubian sandstone aquifer system under the sahara desert is the largest known accumulation of fossil water  the great man-made  river is a scheme launched by libya s colonel gadaffi to tap this aquifer and supply water to coastal kharga oasis in egypt is 150  km (93  mi  long and is the largest oasis in the libyan desert  a lake occupied this depression in ancient times and thick deposits of sandy-clay  resulted  wells are dug to extract water from the porous sandstone that lies seepages may occur in the walls of canyons and pools may survive in deep shade near the dried up watercourse may form in basins where there is sufficient precipitation or meltwater from glaciers above  they are usually shallow and saline  and wind blowing over their surface can cause stress  moving the water over nearby low-lying  areas  when the lakes dry up  they leave a crust or hardpan behind  this area of deposited clay  silt or sand is known as a playa  the deserts of north america have more than one hundred playas  many of them relics of lake bonneville which covered parts of utah  nevada and idaho during the last ice age when the climate was colder and these include the great salt lake  utah lake  sevier lake and many dry lake beds  the smooth flat surfaces of playas have been used for attempted vehicle speed records at black rock desert and bonneville speedway and the united states air force uses rogers dry lake in the mojave desert as runways for aircraft and the space face severe challenges in arid environments  problems they need to solve include how to obtain enough water  how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce  photosynthesis is the key to plant growth  it can only take place during the day as energy from the sun is required  but during the day  many deserts become very hot  opening stomata to allow in the carbon dioxide necessary for the process causes evapotranspiration  and conservation of water is a top priority for desert vegetation  some plants have resolved this problem by adopting crassulacean acid metabolism  allowing them to open their stomata during the night to allow co2  to enter  and close them during the or by using c4  carbon desert plants have reduced the size of their leaves or abandoned them altogether  cacti are desert specialists and in most species the leaves have been dispensed with and the chlorophyll displaced into the trunks  the cellular structure of which has been modified to allow them to store water  when rain falls  the water is rapidly absorbed by the shallow roots and retained to allow them to survive until the next downpour  which may be months or years the giant saguaro cacti of the sonoran desert form  forests   providing shade for other plants and nesting places for desert birds  saguaro grow slowly but may live for up to two hundred years  the surface of the trunk is folded like a concertina  allowing it to expand  and a large specimen can hold eight tons of water after a good are present in both north and south america with a post-gondwana  origin  other xerophytic plants have developed similar strategies by a process known as convergent they limit water loss by reducing the size and number of stomata  by having waxy coatings and hairy or tiny leaves  some are deciduous  shedding their leaves in the driest season  and others curl their leaves up to reduce transpiration  others store water in succulent leaves or stems or in fleshy tubers  desert plants maximize water uptake by having shallow roots that spread widely  or by developing long taproots that reach down to deep rock strata for ground the saltbush in australia has succulent leaves and secretes salt crystals  enabling it to live in saline in common with cacti  many have developed spines to ward off browsing desert plants produce seed which lies dormant in the soil until sparked into growth by rainfall  when annuals  such plants grow with great rapidity and may flower and set seed within weeks  aiming to complete their development before the last vestige of water dries up  for perennial plants  reproduction is more likely to be successful if the seed germinates in a shaded position  but not so close to the parent plant as to be in competition with it  some seed will not germinate until it has been blown about on the desert floor to scarify the seed coat  the seed of the mesquite tree  which grows in deserts in the americas  is hard and fails to sprout even when planted carefully  when it has passed through the gut of a pronghorn it germinates readily  and the little pile of moist dung provides an excellent start to life well away from the parent the stems and leaves of some plants lower the surface velocity of sand-carrying  winds and protect the ground from erosion  even small fungi and microscopic plant organisms found on the soil surface (so-called  cryptobiotic soil  can be a vital link in preventing erosion and providing support for other living organisms  some plants  including the plantago lanceolata  have to reproduce via wind pollination due to living in the environment  cold deserts often have high concentrations of salt in the soil  grasses and low shrubs are the dominant vegetation here and the ground may be covered with lichens  most shrubs have spiny leaves and shed them in the coldest part of the adapted to live in deserts are called xerocoles  there is no evidence that body temperature of mammals and birds is adaptive to the different climates  either of great heat or cold  in fact  with a very few exceptions  their basal metabolic rate is determined by body size  irrespective of the climate in which they many desert animals  and plants  show especially clear evolutionary adaptations for water conservation or heat tolerance and so are often studied in comparative physiology  ecophysiology  and evolutionary physiology  one well-studied  example is the specializations of mammalian kidneys shown by desert-inhabiting  many examples of convergent evolution have been identified in desert organisms  including between cacti and euphorbia  kangaroo rats and jerboas  phrynosoma and moloch present a very challenging environment for animals  not only do they require food and water but they also need to keep their body temperature at a tolerable level  in many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals  they can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes  in hot deserts  gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated  desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights  in order to conserve energy  other desert birds run rather than fly  the cream-colored  courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs  stopping periodically to snatch up insects  like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged  by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary  the sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers  miles  away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily  some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface  the desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its and carbon dioxide are metabolic end products of oxidation of fats  proteins  and oxidising a gram of carbohydrate produces 0.60  grams of water  a gram of protein produces 0.41  grams of water  and a gram of fat produces 1.07  grams of making it possible for xerocoles to live with little or no access to drinking the kangaroo rat for example makes use of this water of metabolism and conserves water both by having a low basal metabolic rate and by remaining underground during the heat of the reducing loss of water through its skin and respiratory system when at herbivorous mammals obtain moisture from the plants they eat  species such as the addax dik-dik,  grant s gazelle and oryx are so efficient at doing this that they apparently never need to the camel is a superb example of a mammal adapted to desert life  it minimizes its water loss by producing concentrated urine and dry dung  and is able to lose 40%  of its body weight through water loss without dying of carnivores can obtain much of their water needs from the body fluids of their many other hot desert animals are nocturnal  seeking out shade during the day or dwelling underground in burrows  at depths of more than 50  cm (20  in   these remain at between 30  to 32  °c (86  to 90  °f  regardless of the external jerboas  desert rats  kangaroo rats and other small rodents emerge from their burrows at night and so do the foxes  coyotes  jackals and snakes that prey on them  kangaroos keep cool by increasing their respiration rate  panting  sweating and moistening the skin of their forelegs with mammals living in cold deserts have developed greater insulation through warmer body fur and insulating layers of fat beneath the skin  the arctic weasel has a metabolic rate that is two or three times as high as would be expected for an animal of its size  birds have avoided the problem of losing heat through their feet by not attempting to maintain them at the same temperature as the rest of their bodies  a form of adaptive the emperor penguin has dense plumage  a downy under layer  an air insulation layer next the skin and various thermoregulatory strategies to maintain its body temperature in one of the harshest environments on ectotherms  reptiles are unable to live in cold deserts but are well-suited  to hot ones  in the heat of the day in the sahara  the temperature can rise to 50  °c (122  °f   reptiles cannot survive at this temperature and lizards will be prostrated by heat at 45  °c (113  °f   they have few adaptations to desert life and are unable to cool themselves by sweating so they shelter during the heat of the day  in the first part of the night  as the ground radiates the heat absorbed during the day  they emerge and search for prey  lizards and snakes are the most numerous in arid regions and certain snakes have developed a novel method of locomotion that enables them to move sidewards and navigate high sand-dunes.  these include the horned viper of africa and the sidewinder of north america  evolutionarily distinct but with similar behavioural patterns because of convergent evolution  many desert reptiles are ambush predators and often bury themselves in the sand  waiting for prey to come within might seem unlikely desert-dwellers,  because of their need to keep their skins moist and their dependence on water for reproductive purposes  in fact  the few species that are found in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations  most of them are fossorial  spending the hot dry months aestivating in deep burrows  while there they shed their skins a number of times and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof cocoon to retain moisture  in the sonoran desert  couch s spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow  heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others  eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates  as the desert dries out  the adult toads rebury themselves  the juveniles stay on the surface for a while  feeding and growing  but soon dig themselves burrows  few make it to the water holding frog in australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain the desert rain frog of namibia is nocturnal and survives because of the damp sea fogs that roll in from the particularly arthropods  have successfully made their homes in the desert  flies  beetles  ants  termites  locusts  millipedes  scorpions and have hard cuticles which are impervious to water and many of them lay their eggs underground and their young develop away from the temperature extremes at the the saharan silver ant  cataglyphis bombycina  uses a heat shock protein in a novel way and forages in the open during brief forays in the heat of the the long-legged  darkling beetle in namibia stands on its front legs and raises its carapace to catch the morning mist as condensate  funnelling the water into its some arthropods make use of the ephemeral pools that form after rain and complete their life cycle in a matter of days  the desert shrimp does this  appearing  miraculously  in new-formed  puddles as the dormant eggs hatch  others  such as brine shrimps  fairy shrimps and tadpole shrimps  are cryptobiotic and can lose up to 92%  of their bodyweight  rehydrating as soon as it rains and their temporary pools have long made use of deserts as places to and more recently have started to exploit them for and energy deserts play a significant role in human culture with an extensive have been living in deserts for millennia  many  such as the bushmen in the kalahari  the aborigines in australia and various tribes of north american indians  were originally hunter-gatherers.  they developed skills in the manufacture and use of weapons  animal tracking  finding water  foraging for edible plants and using the things they found in their natural environment to supply their everyday needs  their self-sufficient  skills and knowledge were passed down through the generations by word of other cultures developed a nomadic way of life as herders of sheep  goats  cattle  camels  yaks  llamas or reindeer  they travelled over large areas with their herds  moving to new pastures as seasonal and erratic rainfall encouraged new plant growth  they took with them their tents made of cloth or skins draped over poles and their diet included milk  blood and sometimes desert nomads were also traders  the sahara is a very large expanse of land stretching from the atlantic rim to egypt  trade routes were developed linking the sahel in the south with the fertile mediterranean region to the north and large numbers of camels were used to carry valuable goods across the desert interior  the tuareg were traders and the goods transported traditionally included slaves  ivory and gold going northwards and salt going southwards  berbers with knowledge of the region were employed to guide the caravans between the various oases and several million slaves may have been taken northwards across the sahara between the 8th  and 18th  traditional means of overland transport declined with the advent of motor vehicles  shipping and air freight  but caravans still travel along routes between agadez and bilma and between timbuktu and taoudenni carrying salt from the interior to desert-edge  the rims of deserts  where more precipitation occurred and conditions were more suitable  some groups took to cultivating crops  this may have happened when drought caused the death of herd animals  forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation  with few inputs  they were at the mercy of the weather and may have lived at bare subsistence level  the land they cultivated reduced the area available to nomadic herders  causing disputes over land  the semi-arid  fringes of the desert have fragile soils which are at risk of erosion when exposed  as happened in the american dust bowl in the 1930s.  the grasses that held the soil in place were ploughed under  and a series of dry years caused crop failures  while enormous dust storms blew the topsoil away  half a million americans were forced to leave their land in this damage is being done today to the semi-arid  areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each desertification is caused by such factors as drought  climatic shifts  tillage for agriculture  overgrazing and deforestation  vegetation plays a major role in determining the composition of the soil  in many environments  the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation unprotected dry surfaces tend to be blown away by the wind or be washed away by flash floods  leaving infertile soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan  although overgrazing has historically been considered to be a cause of desertification  there is some evidence that wild and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and vegetation cover  and that their removal encourages erosive contain substantial mineral resources  sometimes over their entire surface  giving them their characteristic colors  for example  the red of many sand deserts comes from laterite geological processes in a desert climate can concentrate minerals into valuable deposits  leaching by ground water can extract ore minerals and redeposit them  according to the water table  in concentrated similarly  evaporation tends to concentrate minerals in desert lakes  creating dry lake beds or playas rich in minerals  evaporation can concentrate minerals as a variety of evaporite deposits  including gypsum  sodium nitrate  sodium chloride and evaporites are found in the usa s great basin desert  historically exploited by the "20-mule  teams  pulling carts of borax from death valley to the nearest a desert especially rich in mineral salts is the atacama desert  chile  where sodium nitrate has been mined for explosives and fertilizer since around other desert minerals are copper from chile  peru  and iran  and iron and uranium in australia  many other metals  salts and commercially valuable types of rock such as pumice are extracted from deserts around the and gas form on the bottom of shallow seas when micro-organisms  decompose under anoxic conditions and later become covered with sediment  many deserts were at one time the sites of shallow seas and others have had underlying hydrocarbon deposits transported to them by the movement of tectonic some major oilfields such as ghawar are found under the sands of saudi geologists believe that other oil deposits were formed by aeolian processes in ancient deserts as may be the case with some of the major american oil desert farming systems have long been established in north africa  irrigation being the key to success in an area where water stress is a limiting factor to growth  techniques that can be used include drip irrigation  the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises  once fertility has been built up  further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of it has been found that plant growth-promoting  bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil in the vicinity of the plants  a study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental a field trial in the sonoran desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially judean desert was farmed in the 7th  century bc during the iron age to supply food for desert native americans in the south western united states became agriculturalists around 600  ad when seeds and technologies became available from mexico  they used terracing techniques and grew gardens beside seeps  in moist areas at the foot of dunes  near streams providing flood irrigation and in areas irrigated by extensive specially built canals  the hohokam tribe constructed over 500  miles (800  km  of large canals and maintained them for centuries  an impressive feat of engineering  they grew maize  beans  squash and modern example of desert farming is the imperial valley in california  which has high temperatures and average rainfall of just 3  in (76  mm  per the economy is heavily based on agriculture and the land is irrigated through a network of canals and pipelines sourced entirely from the colorado river via the all-american  canal  the soil is deep and fertile  being part of the river s flood plains  and what would otherwise have been desert has been transformed into one of the most productive farming regions in california  other water from the river is piped to urban communities but all this has been at the expense of the river  which below the extraction sites no longer has any above-ground  flow during most of the year  another problem of growing crops in this way is the build-up  of salinity in the soil caused by evaporation of river the greening of the desert remains an aspiration and was at one time viewed as a future means for increasing food production for the world s growing population  this prospect has proved false as it disregarded the environmental damage caused elsewhere by the diversion of water for desert project are increasingly seen as sources for solar energy  partly due to low amounts of cloud cover  many successful solar power plants have been built in the mojave desert  these plants have a combined capacity of 354  megawatts  mw  making them the largest solar power installation in the large swaths of this desert are covered in including nine fields of solar collectors  the mojave solar park is currently under construction and will produce 280mw  when potential for generating solar energy from the sahara desert is huge  the highest found on the globe  professor david faiman of ben-gurion  university has stated that the technology now exists to supply all of the world s electricity needs from 10%  of the sahara desertec industrial initiative was a consortium seeking $560  billion to invest in north african solar and wind installations over the next forty years to supply electricity to europe via cable lines running under the mediterranean sea  european interest in the sahara desert stems from its two aspects  the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land  the sahara receives more sunshine per acre than any part of europe  the sahara desert also has the empty space totalling hundreds of square miles required to house fields of mirrors for solar negev desert  israel  and the surrounding area  including the arava valley  receive plenty of sunshine and are generally not arable  this has resulted in the construction of many solar david faiman has proposed that  giant  solar plants in the negev could supply all of israel s needs for arabs were probably the first organized force to conduct successful battles in the desert  by knowing back routes and the locations of oases and by utilizing camels  muslim arab forces were able to successfully overcome both roman and persian forces in the period 600  to 700  ad during the expansion of the islamic centuries later  both world wars saw fighting in the desert  in the first world war  the ottoman turks were engaged with the british regular army in a campaign that spanned the arabian peninsula  the turks were defeated by the british  who had the backing of irregular arab forces that were seeking to revolt against the turks in the hejaz  made famous in t  e  lawrence s book seven pillars of the second world war  the western desert campaign began in italian libya  warfare in the desert offered great scope for tacticians to use the large open spaces without the distractions of casualties among civilian populations  tanks and armoured vehicles were able to travel large distances unimpeded and land mines were laid in large numbers  however the size and harshness of the terrain meant that all supplies needed to be brought in from great distances  the victors in a battle would advance and their supply chain would necessarily become longer  while the defeated army could retreat  regroup and resupply  for these reasons  the front line moved back and forth through hundreds of kilometers as each side lost and regained its most easterly point was at el alamein in egypt  where the allies decisively defeated the axis forces in desert is generally thought of as a barren and empty landscape  it has been portrayed by writers  film-makers,  philosophers  artists and critics as a place of extremes  a metaphor for anything from death  war or religion to the primitive past or the desolate is an extensive literature on the subject of an early historical account is that of marco polo  c  1254–1324),  who travelled through central asia to china  crossing a number of deserts in his twenty four year some accounts give vivid descriptions of desert conditions  though often accounts of journeys across deserts are interwoven with reflection  as is the case in charles montagu doughty s major work  travels in arabia deserta antoine de saint-exupéry  described both his flying and the desert in wind  sand and and gertrude bell travelled extensively in the arabian desert in the early part of the 20th  century  becoming an expert on the subject  writing books and advising the british government on dealing with the another woman explorer was freya stark who travelled alone in the middle east  visiting turkey  arabia  yemen  syria  persia and afghanistan  writing over twenty books on her the german naturalist uwe george spent several years living in deserts  recording his experiences and research in his book  in the deserts of this american poet robert frost expressed his bleak thoughts in his poem  desert places  which ends with the stanza  they cannot scare me with their empty spaces   between stars -  on stars where no human race is    i have it in me so much nearer home   to scare myself with my own desert is the only planet in the solar system on which deserts have been identified  despite its low surface atmospheric pressure  only 1/100  of that of the earth   the patterns of atmospheric circulation on mars have formed a sea of circumpolar sand more than 5  million km² (1.9  million sq mi  in area  much larger than deserts on earth  the martian deserts principally consist of dunes in the form of half-moons  in flat areas near the permanent polar ice caps in the north of the planet  the smaller dune fields occupy the bottom of many of the craters situated in the martian polar examination of the surface of rocks by laser beamed from the mars exploration rover
