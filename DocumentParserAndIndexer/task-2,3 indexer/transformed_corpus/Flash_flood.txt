 a flash flood is a rapid flooding of geomorphic low-lying  areas  washes  rivers  dry lakes and basins  it may be caused by heavy rain associated with a severe thunderstorm  hurricane  tropical storm  or meltwater from ice or snow flowing over ice sheets or snowfields  flash floods may occur after the collapse of a natural ice or debris dam  or a human structure such as a man-made  dam  as occurred before the johnstown flood of 1889.  flash floods are distinguished from regular floods by a timescale of less than six the water that is temporarily available is often used by plants with rapid germination and short growth cycles and by specially adapted animal needed flash floods can occur under several types of conditions  flash flooding occurs when it rains rapidly on saturated soil or dry soil that has poor absorption ability  the runoff collects in gullies and streams and  as they join to form larger volumes  often forms a fast flowing front of water and debris flash floods most often neukt je in je kontjethe united states national weather service gives the advice  turn around  don t drown  for flash floods  that is  it recommends that people get out of the area of a flash flood  rather than trying to cross it  many people tend to underestimate the dangers of flash floods  what makes flash floods most dangerous is their sudden nature and fast-moving  water  a vehicle provides little to no protection against being swept away  it may make people overconfident and less likely to avoid the flash flood  more than half of the fatalities attributed to flash floods are people swept away in vehicles when trying to cross flooded as little as 2  feet (0.61  m  of water is enough to carry away most suv-sized  the u s  national weather service reported in 2005  that  using a national 30-year  average  more people die yearly in floods  127  on average  than by lightning (73),  tornadoes (65),  or hurricanes deserts  flash floods can be particularly deadly for several reasons  first  storms in arid regions are infrequent  but they can deliver an enormous amount of water in a very short time  second  these rains often fall on poorly absorbent and often clay-like  soil  which greatly increase the amount of runoff that rivers and other water channels have to handle  these regions tend not to have the infrastructure that wetter regions have to divert water from structures and roads  such as storm drains  culverts  and retention basins  either because of sparse population  poverty  or because residents believe the risk of flash floods is not high enough to justify the expense  in fact  in some areas  desert roads frequently cross dry river and creek beds without bridges  from the driver s perspective  there may be clear weather  when a river unexpectedly forms ahead of or around the vehicle in a matter of finally  the lack of regular rain to clear water channels may cause flash floods in deserts to be headed by large amounts of debris  such as rocks  branches  and logs deep slot canyons can be especially dangerous to hikers as they may be flooded by a storm that occurs on a mesa miles away  sweeps through the canyon  and makes it difficult to climb up and out of the way to avoid the flood
