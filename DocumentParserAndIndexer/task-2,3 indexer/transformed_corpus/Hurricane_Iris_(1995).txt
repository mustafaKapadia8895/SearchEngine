 hurricane iris was the ninth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1995  atlantic hurricane season  iris was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect the lesser antilles in a three-week  period  preceding the more destructive hurricanes luis and marilyn  it developed from a tropical wave to the east of the lesser antilles on august 22  and attained hurricane status within 30  hours  the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm before crossing the islands of the eastern caribbean from august 26  through august 28.  during that time  iris became one of four active tropical storms in the atlantic basin  earlier it had interacted with hurricane humberto  and beginning on august 30,  iris interacted with tropical storm karen  iris re-intensified  into a hurricane and attained peak sustained winds of 110  mph (175  km h  while moving slowly across the central atlantic  the hurricane accelerated to the north and absorbed a dissipating tropical depression karen on september 3.  iris weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical on september 4,  though its remnants reattained hurricane-force  winds before affecting western europe on september 7.as  a tropical storm  iris produced heavy rainfall across much of the leeward islands  in the southern lesser antilles  high waves caused coastal flooding in trinidad  while in martinique further north  significant amounts of precipitation led to flooding and landslides  the threat from the hurricane halted airplane evacuations on montserrat  which was being threatened by the eruption of the soufrière hills volcano  there were five deaths in association with iris—four in martinique  and one in guadeloupe a tropical wave exited western africa on august 16,  with a circulation emerging just south of dakar  senegal  it was the first of four consecutive waves that would later develop into tropical cyclones  as the system moved westward  thunderstorms diminished on august 18,  before they gradually redeveloped  at around 1200  utc  the national hurricane center  nhc  classified the system as tropical depression ten about 690  mi (1,110  km  east of the lesser around that time  the depression had a well-organized  area of convection and evident circulation  as confirmed by a nearby within six hours of developing  the depression had intensified into a tropical initially  tropical cyclone forecast models had difficulty predicting the future of the storm  due to uncertain interaction between it and tropical storm humberto to its in real-time,  the nhc upgraded the depression to tropical storm iris at 1500  utc on august or about 21  hours later than assessed in post-analysis.  the intensity was based on satellite intensity at that time  the storm had a ragged central dense overcast—a uniformly circular area of thunderstorms—as well as rainbands to the north and a hurricane hunters flight late on august 23  indicated that iris was significantly stronger  reporting 10–second  sustained winds of 106  mph (170  km h  at based on the reading  it is estimated iris attained hurricane status around 1800  utc that day  or about three hours after it was iris strengthened into a hurricane  it turned to the west-southwest  due to interaction with hurricane humberto  an upper-level  low north of puerto rico increased wind shear over the hurricane  which dislocated the center from the deep convection  as a result  iris weakened to tropical storm status on august 24  after being a hurricane for about 24  as the storm approached the lesser antilles  the thunderstorms decreased markedly and the cloud pattern became as late as august 25,  there was uncertainty whether iris would continue toward the islands or turn to the a new circulation became the dominant center as the storm continued westward  and iris brushed saint lucia early on august 26.  an approaching trough turned the storm to the northwest  bringing it near most of the lesser antilles  early on august 27,  iris weakened to an intensity of 40  mph (64  km h   although it immediately began restrengthening  later that day  the center made landfall on montserrat  anguilla  and barbuda with winds of over 60  mph (95  by that time  an eye began and the structure became better organized as wind shear august 28,  iris moved away from the lesser antilles  and at 1800  utc re-attained  hurricane status as it began a steady motion to the by that time  there was uncertainty in its future track due to the possible interactions among iris  humberto to the northeast  tropical storm karen to the southeast  and the remnants of tropical storm jerry to the in addition  after tropical storm luis formed on august 27,  there were four active tropical cyclones in the a few days later  there were three simultaneous hurricanes  which is a rare event  when luis attained hurricane on august 30,  iris turned to the northeast while it began interacting directly with tropical storm karen  over the next few days  the smaller tropical storm moved around the larger circulation of iris  potentially causing the hurricane to move iris  intensity did not change significantly during that time  and it maintained strong outflow but a weak eyewall  an eastward-moving  trough bypassed the storm to the north  causing the motion to become nearly a building ridge to the northeast caused iris to turn to a northwest drift on september 1.  by that time  the eye had become distinct and and at 0600  utc that day  iris attained peak winds of 110  mph (175  km h  to the southeast of reaching peak intensity  the hurricane began weakening due to increasing shear and cooler an approaching trough turned iris to the and early on september 3  the hurricane passed about 350  mi (560  km  east of that day  iris absorbed the dissipating tropical depression it accelerated to the northeast as it lost tropical characteristics  and after weakening to a tropical storm  iris transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september 4  to the southeast of newfoundland  the remnants turned to the moving in tandem with an extratropical storm to its on september 5,  the barometric pressure dropped by more than 24  millibars (0.71  inhg   which qualified as being classified as a meteorological the next day  the winds strengthened to and the storm maintained a track to the east due to a ridge weakening to the north  the pressure reached a minimum of 957  mb (28.3  inhg  early on september 7,  lower than while iris was that day  the storm weakened as it entered the english channel  and the extratropical remnants continued across western iris moved through the lesser antilles  tropical storm watches  and later warnings  were issued from barbados through the british virgin islands  the storm produced tropical storm force winds across the eastern caribbean  although the primary meteorological event occurred from heavy flooding prompted evacuations in communities in saint lucia  dominica  and saint vincent and the iris was the first of three storms in a three-week  period to affect the region  preceding the more destructive hurricanes luis and western trinidad  a feeder produced winds of 37  mph (60  km h  along the gulf of paria  the winds increased waves that caused coastal flooding and some damage to on martinique  iris produced gusts of 56  mph (90  km h   with torrential rainfall occurring on the island  a station in les trois-îlets  recorded 1.89  in (48  mm  in a 30  minute period  and the highest total on the island was 17.72  in (450  mm  at ducos  the rains caused mudslides that killed four including two after a house was swept off a cliff in le vauclin  flooding was reported across coastal areas of martinique  and heavy damage was reported in the southern city of le to the north of martinique  winds reached 43  mph (69  km h  on while the storm passed guadeloupe  it produced sustained winds of 45  mph (72  km h   with gusts to 65  mph (105  km h  on la there was one death on the island after a person drowned in a storm-flooded  to the northwest  the hurricane moved over causing additional problems on the island just weeks after the soufrière hills volcano began officials on the island closed the primary airport due to the storm  which prevented residents from evacuating from the island from the volcano further north  iris dropped 6  in (150  mm  of rain on antigua  which destroyed banana trees and caused flooding in low-lying  to uncertainties in iris  track  the government of bermuda issued a tropical storm watch on september 1.  this was downgraded on september 3  after the hurricane bypassed the later  after iris became extratropical  the storm produced winds of 45  mph (72  km h  at la rochelle on the atlantic coast of
