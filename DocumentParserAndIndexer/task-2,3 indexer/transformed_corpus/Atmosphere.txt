 an atmosphere  from greek ἀτμός  atmos   meaning  vapor   and σφαῖρα  sphaira   meaning is a layer of gases surrounding a planet or other material body  that is held in place by the gravity of that body  an atmosphere is more likely to be retained if the gravity it is subject to is high and the temperature of the atmosphere is low the atmosphere of earth is composed of nitrogen  about 78%),  oxygen  about 21%),  argon  about 0.9%)  with carbon dioxide and other gases in trace amounts  oxygen is used by most organisms for respiration  nitrogen is fixed by bacteria and lightning to produce ammonia used in the construction of nucleotides and amino acids  and carbon dioxide is used by plants  algae and cyanobacteria for photosynthesis  the atmosphere helps to protect living organisms from genetic damage by solar ultraviolet radiation  solar wind and cosmic rays  the current composition of the earth s atmosphere is the product of billions of years of biochemical modification of the paleoatmosphere by living organisms the term stellar atmosphere describes the outer region of a star and typically includes the portion above the opaque photosphere  stars with sufficiently low temperatures may have outer atmospheres with compound molecules atmospheric pressure at a particular location is the force per unit area perpendicular to a surface determined by the weight of the vertical column of atmosphere above that location  on earth  units of air pressure are based on the internationally recognized standard atmosphere  atm   which is defined as 101.325  kpa (760  torr or 14.696  psi   it is measured with a barometer atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude due to the diminishing mass of gas above  the height at which the pressure from an atmosphere declines by a factor of e  an irrational number with a value of 2.71828...)  is called the scale height and is denoted by h  for an atmosphere with a uniform temperature  the scale height is proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the product of the mean molecular mass of dry air and the local acceleration of gravity at that location  for such a model atmosphere  the pressure declines exponentially with increasing altitude  however  atmospheres are not uniform in temperature  so estimation of the atmospheric pressure at any particular altitude is more complex surface gravity differs significantly among the planets  for example  the large gravitational force of the giant planet jupiter retains light gases such as hydrogen and helium that escape from objects with lower gravity  secondly  the distance from the sun determines the energy available to heat atmospheric gas to the point where some fraction of its molecules  thermal motion exceed the planet s escape velocity  allowing those to escape a planet s gravitational grasp  thus  distant and cold titan  triton  and pluto are able to retain their atmospheres despite their relatively low gravities since a collection of gas molecules may be moving at a wide range of velocities  there will always be some fast enough to produce a slow leakage of gas into space  lighter molecules move faster than heavier ones with the same thermal kinetic energy  and so gases of low molecular weight are lost more rapidly than those of high molecular weight  it is thought that venus and mars may have lost much of their water when  after being photo dissociated into hydrogen and oxygen by solar ultraviolet  the hydrogen escaped  earth s magnetic field helps to prevent this  as  normally  the solar wind would greatly enhance the escape of hydrogen  however  over the past 3  billion years earth may have lost gases through the magnetic polar regions due to auroral activity  including a net 2%  of its atmospheric mechanisms that can cause atmosphere depletion are solar wind-induced  sputtering  impact erosion  weathering  and sequestration—sometimes referred to as  freezing out —into the regolith and polar caps atmospheres have dramatic effects on the surfaces of rocky bodies  objects that have no atmosphere  or that have only an exosphere  have terrain that is covered in craters  without an atmosphere  the planet has no protection from meteoroids  and all of them collide with the surface as meteorites and create craters most meteoroids burn up as meteors before hitting a planet s surface  when meteoroids do impact  the effects are often erased by the action of wind  as a result  craters are rare on objects with needed wind erosion is a significant factor in shaping the terrain of rocky planets with atmospheres  and over time can erase the effects of both craters and volcanoes  in addition  since liquids can not exist without pressure  an atmosphere allows liquid to be present at the surface  resulting in lakes  rivers and oceans  earth and titan are known to have liquids at their surface and terrain on the planet suggests that mars had liquid on its surface in the past a planet s initial atmospheric composition is related to the chemistry and temperature of the local solar nebula during planetary formation and the subsequent escape of interior gases  the original atmospheres started with the radially local rotating gases that collapsed to the spaced rings that formed the needed  they were then modified over time by various complex factors  resulting in quite different outcomes the atmospheres of the planets venus and mars are primarily composed of carbon dioxide  with small quantities of nitrogen  argon  oxygen and traces of other gases the atmospheric composition on earth is largely governed by the by-products  of the life that it sustains  dry air from earth s atmosphere contains 78.08%  nitrogen  20.95%  oxygen  0.93%  argon  0.04%  carbon dioxide  and traces of hydrogen  helium  and other  noble  gases  by volume   but generally a variable amount of water vapor is also present  on average about 1%  at sea level the low temperatures and higher gravity of the solar system s giant planets—jupiter  saturn  uranus and neptune—allow them more readily to retain gases with low molecular masses  these planets have hydrogen–helium atmospheres  with trace amounts of more complex compounds two satellites of the outer planets possess significant atmospheres  titan  a moon of saturn  and triton  a moon of neptune  have atmospheres mainly of nitrogen  when in the part of its orbit closest to the sun  pluto has an atmosphere of nitrogen and methane similar to triton s  but these gases are frozen when it is farther from the sun other bodies within the solar system have extremely thin atmospheres not in equilibrium  these include the moon  sodium gas   mercury  sodium gas   europa  oxygen   io  sulfur   and enceladus  water vapor  the first exoplanet whose atmospheric composition was determined is hd 209458b,  a gas giant with a close orbit around a star in the constellation pegasus  its atmosphere is heated to temperatures over 1,000  k  and is steadily escaping into space  hydrogen  oxygen  carbon and sulfur have been detected in the planet s inflated atmosphere consists of a number of layers that differ in properties such as composition  temperature and pressure  the lowest layer is the troposphere  which extends from the surface to the bottom of the stratosphere  three quarters of the atmosphere s mass resides within the troposphere  and is the layer within which the earth s terrestrial weather develops  the depth of this layer varies between 17  km at the equator to 7  km at the poles  the stratosphere  extending from the top of the troposphere to the bottom of the mesosphere  contains the ozone layer  the ozone layer ranges in altitude between 15  and 35  km  and is where most of the ultraviolet radiation from the sun is absorbed  the top of the mesosphere  ranges from 50  to 85  km  and is the layer wherein most meteors burn up  the thermosphere extends from 85  km to the base of the exosphere at 690  km and contains the ionosphere  a region where the atmosphere is ionised by incoming solar radiation  the ionosphere increases in thickness and moves closer to the earth during daylight and rises at night allowing certain frequencies of radio communication a greater range  the kármán line  located within the thermosphere at an altitude of 100  km  is commonly used to define the boundary between earth s atmosphere and outer space  the exosphere begins variously from about 690  to 1,000  km above the surface  where it interacts with the planet s magnetosphere  each of the layers has a different lapse rate  defining the rate of change in temperature with height other astronomical bodies such as these listed have known atmospheres the circulation of the atmosphere occurs due to thermal differences when convection becomes a more efficient transporter of heat than thermal radiation  on planets where the primary heat source is solar radiation  excess heat in the tropics is transported to higher latitudes  when a planet generates a significant amount of heat internally  such as is the case for jupiter  convection in the atmosphere can transport thermal energy from the higher temperature interior up to the surface from the perspective of a planetary geologist  the atmosphere acts to shape a planetary surface  wind picks up dust and other particles which  when they collide with the terrain  erode the relief and leave deposits  eolian processes   frost and precipitations  which depend on the atmospheric composition  also influence the relief  climate changes can influence a planet s geological history  conversely  studying the surface of the earth leads to an understanding of the atmosphere and climate of other planets for a meteorologist  the composition of the earth s atmosphere is a factor affecting the climate and its variations for a biologist or paleontologist  the earth s atmospheric composition is closely dependent on the appearance of the life and its evolution
