 the magdalenian  also madelenian  french  magdalénien  refers to one of the later cultures of the upper paleolithic in western europe  dating from around 17,000  to 12,000  years it is named after the type site of la madeleine  a rock shelter located in the vézère valley  commune of tursac  in the dordogne department of france originally termed l âge du renne  the age of the reindeer  by édouard lartet and henry christy  the first systematic excavators of the type site  in their publication of 1875,  the magdalenian is synonymous in many people s minds with reindeer hunters  although magdalenian sites also contain extensive evidence for the hunting of red deer  horses  and other large mammals present in europe toward the end of the last ice age  the culture was geographically widespread  and later magdalenian sites have been found from portugal in the west to poland in the east  it is the third epoch of gabriel de mortillet s cave chronology system  corresponding roughly to the late pleistocene the magdalenian epoch was a long one  represented by numerous stations  whose contents show progress in the arts and general culture  it was characterized by a cold and dry climate  the existence of humans in association with the reindeer  and the extinction of the mammoth  the use of bone and ivory for various implements  already begun in the preceding solutrian epoch  was much increased  and the period is essentially a bone period  the bone instruments are quite varied  spear-points,  harpoon-heads,  borers  hooks  and needles most remarkable is the evidence la madeleine affords of prehistoric art  numbers of bones  reindeer antlers  and animal teeth were found  with rude pictures carved or etched on them of seals  fishes  reindeer  mammoths  and other creatures  the best of these are a mammoth engraved on a fragment of its own – discuss  a dagger of reindeer antler  with a handle in form of a reindeer  a cave-bear  cut on a flat piece of schist  a seal on a bear s tooth  a fish drawn on a reindeer antler  and a complete picture  also on reindeer antler  showing horses  an aurochs  trees  and a snake biting a man s leg  the man is naked  which  together with the snake  suggests a warm climate in spite of the presence of the reindeer the fauna of the magdelenian epoch seems  indeed  to have included tigers and other tropical species side by side with reindeer  blue foxes  arctic hares  and other polar creatures  magdelenian humans appear to have been of low stature  dolichocephalic  with a low retreating forehead and prominent brow ridges the culture spans from approximately 17,000  to 12,000  bp  toward the end of the last ice age  the magdalenian tool culture is characterised by regular blade industries struck from carinated cores  typologically  the magdalenian is divided into six phases which are generally agreed to have chronological significance  the earliest phases are recognised by the varying proportion of blades and specific varieties of scrapers  the middle phases marked by the emergence of a microlithic component  particularly the distinctive denticulated microliths   and the later phases by the presence of uniserial  phase 5)  and biserial  harpoons   phase 6)  made of bone  antler  and is extensive debate about the precise nature of the earliest magdalenian assemblages  and it remains questionable whether the badegoulian culture is  in fact  the earliest phase of the magdalenian  similarly  finds from the forest of beauregard near paris often have been suggested as belonging to the earliest the earliest magdalenian sites are all found in france  the epigravettian is a similar culture appearing at the same time in italy  the balkans  moldavia  romania  and russia the later phases of the magdalenian are also synonymous with the human re-settlement  of north-western  europe after the last glacial maximum during the late glacial maximum  research in switzerland  southern and belgium has provided ams radiocarbon dating to support this  being hunter gatherers  magdalenians did not simply re-settle  permanently in north-west  europe  however  as they often followed herds and moved depending on seasons by the end of the magdalenian  the lithic technology shows a pronounced trend toward increased microlithisation  the bone harpoons and points have the most distinctive chronological markers within the typological sequence  as well as flint tools  the magdalenians are best known for their elaborate worked bone  antler  and ivory that served both functional and aesthetic purposes  including perforated batons  examples of magdalenian portable art include batons  figurines  and intricately engraved projectile points  as well as items of personal adornment including sea shells  perforated carnivore teeth  presumably necklaces   and fossils the sea shells and fossils found in magdalenian sites may be sourced to relatively precise areas of origin  and so have been used to support hypothesis of magdalenian hunter-gatherer  seasonal ranges  and perhaps trade routes  cave sites such as the world famous lascaux contain the best known examples of magdalenian cave art  the site of altamira in spain  with its extensive and varied forms of magdalenian mobiliary art has been suggested to be an agglomeration site where many small groups of magdalenian hunter-gatherers  northern spain and south-west  france this tool culture was superseded by the azilian culture  in northern europe it was followed by different variants of the tjongerian techno-complex.  it has been suggested that key late-glacial  sites in south-western  britain also may be attributed to the magdalenian  including the famous site of kent s cavern  although this remains open to debate besides la madeleine  the chief stations of the epoch are les eyzies  laugerie-basse,  and gorges d enfer in the dordogne  grotte du placard in charente and others in south-west  france
