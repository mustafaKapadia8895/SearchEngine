 tnt equivalent is a convention for expressing energy  typically used to describe the energy released in an explosion  the  ton of tnt  is a unit of energy defined by that convention to be 4.184  which is the approximate energy released in the detonation of a metric ton (1,000  kilograms or one megagram  of tnt  the convention intends to compare the destructiveness of an event with that of conventional explosive materials  of which tnt is a typical example  although other conventional explosives such as dynamite contain more energy the  kiloton  of tnt   is a unit of energy equal to 4.184  terajoules the  megaton  of tnt   is a unit of energy equal to 4.184  petajoules the kiloton and megaton of tnt have traditionally been used to describe the energy output  and hence the destructive power  of a nuclear weapon  the tnt equivalent appears in various nuclear weapon control treaties  and has been used to characterize the energy released in such other highly destructive events as an asteroid gram of tnt releases 2673â€“6702  j  joules  upon the energy liberated by one gram of tnt was arbitrarily defined as a matter of convention to be 4184  which is exactly one kilocalorie an explosive s energy is normally expressed as the thermodynamic work produced by its detonation  which for tnt has been accurately measured as 4686  j g from a large sample of air blast experiments  and theoretically calculated to be 4853  measured  pure heat output of a gram of tnt is only 2724  needed  but this is not the important value for explosive blast effect calculations alternative tnt equivalency can be calculated as a function of when in the detonation the value is measured and which property is being kiloton of tnt can be visualized as a cube of tnt 8.46  metres (27.8  ft  on a side.1  ton tnt equivalent is approximately the relative effectiveness factor  re factor   relates an explosive s demolition power to that of tnt  in units of the tnt equivalent kg  tnte kg   the re factor is the relative mass of tnt to which an explosive is equivalent  the greater the re  the more powerful the explosive this enables engineers to determine the proper masses of different explosives when applying blasting formulas developed specifically for tnt  for example  if a timber-cutting  formula calls for a charge of 1  kg of tnt  then based on octanitrocubane s re factor of 2.38,  it would take only 1.0/2.38   or 0.42)  kg of it to do the same job  using petn  engineers would need 1.0/1.66   or 0.60)  kg to obtain the same effects as 1  kg of tnt  with anfo or ammonium nitrate  they would require 1.0/0.74   or 1.35)  kg or 1.0/0.42   or 2.38)  kg  respectively    tbx  thermobaric explosives  or ebx  enhanced blast explosives   in a small  confined space  may have over twice the power of destruction  the total power of aluminized mixtures strictly depends on the condition of explosions
