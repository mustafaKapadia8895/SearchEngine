 the 1935  labor day hurricane was the most intense hurricane to make landfall in the united states on and the most intense atlantic hurricane until hurricane gilbert  the second tropical cyclone  second hurricane  and second major hurricane of the 1935  atlantic hurricane season  the labor day hurricane was the first of three category 5  hurricanes to strike the united states at that intensity during the 20th  century  the other two being 1969's  hurricane camille and 1992's  hurricane andrew   after forming as a weak tropical storm east of the bahamas on august 29,  it slowly proceeded westward and became a hurricane on september 1.on  long key  it struck about midway through the calm  the waters quickly receded after carving new channels connecting the bay with the ocean  however  gale force winds and high seas persisted into tuesday  preventing rescue efforts  the storm continued northwest along the florida west coast  weakening before its second landfall near cedar key  florida  on september 4.the  compact and intense hurricane caused extreme damage in the upper florida keys  as a storm surge of approximately 18  to 20  feet (5.5–6  meters  swept over the low-lying  islands  the hurricane s strong winds and the surge destroyed nearly all the structures between tavernier and marathon  the town of islamorada was obliterated  portions of the key west extension of the florida east coast railway were severely damaged or destroyed  the hurricane also caused additional damage in northwest florida  georgia  and the carolinas “the first indications of conditions favorable to the origin of this disturbance were noted during the last 2  or 3  days of august  to the eastward and northward of turks islands  but it was not until august 31  that a definite depression appeared near long island in the southeastern bahamas  and deepened rapidly as it moved westward  … hurricane intensity was doubtless reached by the developing disturbance near the south end of andros island on september “a broad recurve brought it to the florida keys late on september 2.  by that time it was of small diameter but of tremendous force  … there was a calm of forty minutes on lower matecumbe key and about fifty-five  minutes at the long key fishing camp  9:20  to 10:15  p m  the rate of progress of the hurricane was about ten miles an hour and the calm center must have been nine to ten miles in diameter  after leaving the keys  the storm skirted the florida gulf coast on a broad recurve  passed inland at cedar keys and finally left the continent near cape heavy rainfall spread in advance and magnified to the left of the track across the mid-atlantic  states  rainfall totals of 16.7  inches (420  mm  in easton  maryland  and 13.4  inches (340  mm  at atlantic city  new jersey  were the highest seen with the storm continued into “the north atlantic ocean  where  off southern greenland  it was lost on september 10  by merging with a cyclone of extratropical first recorded instance of an aircraft flown for the specific purpose of locating a hurricane occurred on the afternoon of september 2.  the weather bureau’s 1:30  pm placed the center of the hurricane at north latitude 23°  20’,  west longitude 80°  15’,  moving slowly westward  this was about 27  miles north of isabela de sagua  villa clara  cuba  and 145  miles east of havana  captain leonard povey of the cuban army air corps volunteered to investigate the threat to the capital  flying a curtis hawk ii  captain povey  an american expatriate who was the ceac s chief training officer  observed the storm north of its reported position but  flying an open-cockpit  biplane  opted not to fly into he later proposed an aerial hurricane nothing further came of this idea until june 1943  when colonel joe duckworth and lieutenant ralph o hair flew into a hurricane near galveston  labor day hurricane was the most intense storm ever known to have struck the united states  and any land areas in the western hemisphere   having the lowest sea level pressure ever recorded in the united states—a central pressure of 892  mbar (26.35  inhg —suggesting an intensity of between 162  kn and 164  kn (186.4  mph – 188.7  mph   the somewhat compensating effects of a slow (7  kn  8.1  mph  translational velocity along with an extremely tiny radius of maximum wind (5  nmi  9.3  miles  led to an analyzed intensity at landfall of 160  kt (184.1  mph  category 5).  this is the highest intensity for a u s  landfalling hurricane in hurdat2,  as 1969’s  hurricane camille has been recently reanalyzed to have the second highest landfalling intensity with 150  kn (172.6  of the lowest pressure were secured from three aneroid barometers  the values ranging from 26.75  to 26.98  inches  however  none of these barometers had previously been compared to standard  one of the barometers  owned by ivar olson  was shipped to the weather bureau in washington where it was tested in the instrument division  careful laboratory tests showed it to be an exceptionally responsive and reliable instrument and that the correct reading at the position of the needle indicated by mr  olson at the center of the storm was 26.35  inches  this is the world s lowest record of pressure at a land refers to maximum sustained wind speed upon striking land northeast storm were ordered displayed from fort pierce to fort myers in the september 1,  9:30  am weather bureau upon receipt of this advisory the u s  coast guard station  miami  fl  sent a plane along the coast to advise boaters and campers of the impending danger by dropping message blocks  a second flight was made sunday afternoon  all planes were placed in the hangar and its door closed at 10:00  am monday the 3:30  am advisory  september 2   labor day   predicted the disturbance  will probably pass through the florida straits monday  and cautioned  against high tides and gales florida keys and ships in the 1:30  pm advisory ordered hurricane for the key west which extended north to key at around 2:00  pm  fred ghent  assistant administrator  florida emergency relief administration  requested a special train to evacuate the veterans work camps located in the upper it departed miami at 4:25  pm  delayed by a draw bridge opening  obstructions across the track  poor visibility and the necessity to back the locomotive below homestead  so it could head out on the return the train finally arrived at the islamorada station on upper matecumbe key at about 8:20  pm  this coincided with an abrupt wind shift from northeast  florida bay  to southeast  atlantic ocean  and the arrival on the coast of the storm ships ran afoul of the storm   the danish motorship leise maersk was carried over alligator reef and grounded nearly 4  miles beyond  after being totally disabled by the wind and sea  with engine room this was just offshore of upper matecumbe key  no one died and the ship was salvaged on sept  20.   the american tanker pueblo drifted helplessly in the storm from 2  to 10  pm of september 2;  she went out of control near 24°40′n  80°25′w﻿    ﻿24.667°n  80.417°w﻿    24.667;  -80.417,  and was carried completely around the storm center  finding herself in 8  hours about 25  miles northeastward of her original position  and just barely able to claw off molasses however  the ship that made the headlines was the american steamship dixie out of new orleans  with a crew of 121  and 229  it ran aground on french reef  near key largo  without loss of life  it was re-floated  on september 19  and towed to new upper matecumbe key  near islamorada  an eleven-car  evacuation train encountered a powerful storm surge topped by cresting waves  eleven were swept from the tracks  leaving only the locomotive and tender upright and still on the rails  remarkably  everyone on the train the locomotive and tender were both barged back to miami several months later the hurricane left a path of near destruction in the upper keys  centered on what is today the village of islamorada  the eye of the storm passed a few miles to the southwest creating a calm of about 40  minutes duration over lower matecumbe and 55  minutes (9:20–10:15  pm  over long key  at camp #3  on lower matecumbe the surge arrived near the end of the calm with the wind close nearly every structure was demolished  and some bridges and railway embankments were washed away  the links—rail  road  and ferry boats—that chained the islands together were broken  the main transportation route linking the keys to mainland florida had been a single railroad line  the florida overseas railroad portion of the florida east coast railway  the islamorada area was devastated  although the hurricane s destructive path was narrower than most tropical cyclones  its eye was eight miles (13  km   across and the fiercest winds extended 15  miles (24  km   off the center  less than 1992's  hurricane andrew  which was also a relatively small and catastrophic category 5  hurricane  craig key  long key  and upper matecumbe and lower matecumbe keys suffered the worst  the storm caused wind and flood damage along the florida panhandle and into georgia  and significant damage to the tampa bay after the third day of the storm corpses swelled and split open in the subtropical heat  according to rescue workers  public health officials ordered plain wood coffins holding the dead to be stacked and burned in several locations  the national weather service estimated 408  deaths from the hurricane  bodies were recovered as far away as flamingo and cape sable on the southwest tip of the florida mainland the united states coast guard and other federal and state agencies organized evacuation and relief efforts  boats and airplanes carried injured survivors to miami  the railroad was never rebuilt  but temporary bridges and ferry landings were under construction as soon as materials arrived  on march 29,  1938,  the last gap in the overseas highway linking key west to the mainland was completed  the new highway incorporated the roadbed and surviving bridges of the railway three veterans’ work camps existed in the florida keys before the hurricane  #1  on windley key  #3  and #5  on lower matecumbe the camp payrolls for august 30  listed 695  they were employed in a project to complete the overseas highway connecting the mainland with key west  the camps  including 7  in florida and 4  in south carolina  were established by harry l  hopkins  director of the federal emergency relief administration  fera   in the autumn of 1934  the problem of transient veterans in washington dc “threatened … to become acute and did become acute in facilities in the capital were inadequate to handle the large numbers of veterans seeking president franklin d  roosevelt met with mr  hopkins and robert fechner  director of the civilian conservation corps  ccc  to discuss solutions  he “suggested the southern camp plan and approved the program worked out by mr  hopkins for their establishment and the va identified eligible fera offered grants to the states for their construction projects if they would accept the veterans as laborers  the state emergency relief administrations were responsible for the daily management of the in practice the state eras were very much the creatures of fera  to the extent of handpicking the that only two states participated was perhaps attributable to the then popular impression that the transient veterans were “diseased” bums and it was a characterization enthusiastically fed by the media  in august 1935  both time and the new york times published sensational on aug  15,  1935,  hopkins announced the termination of the veterans work program and closure of all the august 26  and 27,  1935,  one of the veterans  albert c  keith  wrote letters to both the president and eleanor roosevelt urging that the camps not be closed  keith was editor of the weekly camp paper  the key veteran news  he was emphatic that the veterans were being defamed and that their work program was actually a success story  rehabilitating many veterans for return to civilian life  the news published occasional reports from camp #2,  mullet key  st  petersburg  florida  at the entrance to tampa bay  this was the  colored  veterans camp  the keys camps were white only  in early august the colored veterans were transferred to the new camp #8  in gainesville  weather conditions on wednesday  september 4,  permitted the evacuation of survivors to begin  participating in the rescue wereon the evening of september 4,  1935,  brigadier general frank t  hines  va administrator  received a phone call from hyde park  new york  it was stephen early  the president’s press secretary  he had orders from the president who was very distressed by the news from florida  the va was to  1.  cooperate with fera in seeing that everything possible be done for those injured in the hurricane  2.  see that the bodies were properly cared for shipment home to relatives  and that those bodies for which shipment home was not requested be sent to arlington national cemetery  and  3.  conduct a very careful joint investigation with mr  hopkins’ organization  to determine whether there was any fault that would lie against anyone in the administration  hines’ representative in florida was to take full charge of the situation and all other organizations and agencies were ordered to president’s first order was straight forward and promptly executed  124  injured veterans were treated in miami area hospitals  9  of these died  56  were later transferred to va medical uninjured veterans were removed to camp foster in jacksonville and evaluated for transfer to the ccc  those declining transfer or deemed unemployable were paid off and given tickets all of the fera transient camps were closed in november in december 1935  fera itself was absorbed within the new wpa  also directed by second and third orders  however  were almost immediately compromised  at a news conference on september 5,  hopkins asserted that there was no negligence traceable to fera in the failed evacuation of the camps as the weather bureau advisories had given insufficient warning  he also dispatched his assistant  aubrey willis williams  to florida to coordinate fera efforts and to investigate the williams and hines’ assistant  colonel george e  ijams  both arrived in miami on september 6.  ijams concentrated on the dead  their collection  identification and proper this was to prove exceptionally difficult  bodies were scattered throughout the keys and their rapid decomposition created ghastly conditions  state and local health officials demanded a ban on all movement of bodies and their immediate burial or cremation in place  the next day governor sholtz so this was reluctantly agreed to by hines with the understanding that those buried would be later disinterred and shipped home or to arlington when permitted by the state health cremations began on saturday  september 7;  38  bodies were burned together at the collection point beside snake creek  over the next week 136  bodies were cremated on upper matecumbe key at 12  different locations  on lower matecumbe key 82  were burned at 20  sites  on numerous small keys in florida bay bodies were either burned or buried where found  this effort continued into november  123  bodies had been transported to miami before the embargo  these were processed at a temporary morgue staffed by fingerprint experts and 8  volunteer undertakers under tents at woodlawn park cemetery (3260  sw 8th  st  miami   the intention was to identify the remains and prepare them for burial or further shipment  with the embargo in force immediate burial of all the bodies at woodlawn was mandatory  fera purchased a plot in section 2a.  the va coordinated the ceremony with full military honors on september 109  bodies were buried in the fera plot  81  veterans  9  civilians and 19  unidentified some records claim 259  veterans were victims of the hurricane total  108  civilians and 162  veterans  cremated  of the rest total  55  civilians and 97  veterans buried total  163  civilians and 259  veterans the congressional record gives a report of 485  victims of the hurricane {257  veterans and 259  the record also breaks down 694  world war i veterans by name and their status as  survived died the florida emergency relief administration reported that as of november 19,  1935,  the total of dead stood at 423:  259  veterans and 164  civilians  these numbers are reflected on the veterans storm relief map  which see   by march 1,  1936,  62  additional bodies had been recovered bringing the total to 485:  257  veterans and 228  the discrepancy in veterans’ deaths resulted from the difficulty in identifying bodies  particularly those found months after the hurricane  and a question of definition  whether to count just those on the camp payrolls or to include others  not enrolled  who happened to be veterans  the veterans’ affairs administration  va  compiled its own list of veterans’ deaths  121  dead-positive  identification  90  missing  and 45  dead-identification  tentative  totaling 256.  five others are named in a footnote  one proved to be a misidentification of a previously listed veteran  two were state employees working at the camps  and two were unaffiliated veterans caught in the storm  this gives a total for all veterans of adding this to the florida emergency relief administration number for civilians gives a total of 488  for all deaths  12  of the dead were listed as hemingway visited the veteran s camp by boat after weathering the hurricane at his home in key west  he wrote about the devastation in a critical article titled  who killed the vets   for the new masses hemingway implied that the fera workers and families  who were unfamiliar with the risks of florida hurricane season  were unwitting victims of a system that appeared to lack concern for their welfare  from ernest hemingway s statement on the people  yachtsmen  fishermen such as president hoover and president roosevelt  do not come to the florida keys in hurricane months     there is a known danger to property  but veterans  especially the bonus-marching  variety of veterans  are not property  they are only human beings  unsuccessful human beings  and all they have to lose is their lives  they are doing coolie labor for a top wage of $45  a month and they have been put down on the florida keys where they can t make trouble  it is hurricane months  sure  but if anything comes up  you can always evacuate them  can t you    it is not necessary to go into the deaths of the civilians and their families since they were on the keys of their own free will  they made their living there  had property and knew the hazards involved  but the veterans had been sent there  they had no opportunity to leave  nor any protection against hurricanes  and they never had a chance for their lives  who sent nearly a thousand war veterans  many of them husky  hard-working  and simply out of luck  but many of them close to the border of pathological cases  to live in frame shacks on the florida keys in hurricane months in the same issue of the new masses appeared an editorial charging criminal negligence and a cartoon by russell t  limbach  captioned  an act of god  depicting burning a washington post editorial on sept  5,  titled ruin in the veterans  camps  stated the widely held opinion that the ″camps were havens of rest designed to keep bonus marchers away from washington    most of these veterans are drifters  psychopathic cases or habitual troublemakers    those who are nor physically or mentally handicapped have no claim whatsoever to special rewards in return for bonus meanwhile rushed to complete the investigation  he finished on sunday  september 8,  the day an elaborate memorial service and mass burial of hurricane victims  both coordinated by ijams  were held in ijams who had been too busy to participate in the investigation and had not questioned any of the 12  witnesses interrogated by williams  nonetheless signed the 15  page report to the that night williams released it to the miami press in a radio broadcast immediately following the memorial ceremony  ijams considered the timing unfortunate after receiving several critical telephone the report exonerated everyone involved and concluded  “to our mind the catastrophe must be characterized as an act of god and was by its very nature beyond the power of man or instruments at his disposal to foresee sufficiently far enough in advance to permit the taking of adequate precautions capable of preventing the death and desolation which early also found the publicity around the report  unfortunate   in a telegram to his colleague  assistant presidential secretary marvin h  mcintyre  early wrote that he had authorized hines to proceed with a  complete and exhaustive  joint investigation with hopkins  significantly hines was to  instruct his investigator that under no circumstances will any statement be made to the press until final report has been submitted to the hopkins gave similar instructions to his investigator  mcintyre also was involved in damage control  on sept  10,  1935,  the greater miami ministerial association wrote the president an angry letter labeling the report a  whitewash   mcintyre forwarded it to fera for a response  williams returned a draft for the president s signature on sept  25th  insisting the report was only preliminary and that the  final and detailed report     will be both thorough and assigned john abt  assistant general counsel for fera  to complete the investigation  on sept  11,  1935,  hines directed the skeptical and meticulous david w  kennamer to investigate the disaster  there was immediate friction between them  kennamer believed abt did not have an open mind and abt felt further investigation was working with harry w  farmer  another va investigator  kennamer completed his 2  volume report on october 30,  1935.  farmer added a third volume concerning the identification of the veterans  kennamer s report included 2,168  pages of 118  pages of and a 19  page general his findings differed substantially from those of williams  citing three officials of the florida emergency relief administration as negligent  administrator conrad van hyning  asst  administrator fred ghent and camp superintendent ray sheldon   in a response to abt s draft report to the ijams sided with hines and hopkins never agreed on a final report  and kennamer’s findings were suppressed  they remained so for might speculate that hines wished to avoid a public quarrel with hopkins  who had enjoyed roosevelt’s patronage since his term as new york governor  hines was a holdover from the hoover administration  such an internal dispute would embarrass the roosevelt administration at the time a vote on the adjusted compensation payment act  “bonus bill”  was upcoming  it passed on jan  27,  1936,  over the president’s also  1936  was a presidential election year  kennamer did appear at the house hearings in april 1936,  along with hines  ijams  williams and the 3  officials he pilloried in his report  he was not questioned about his controversial findings nor did he volunteer his november 1,  1935,  the american legion completed its own report on the hurricane  the legion s national commander  ray murphy  mailed a copy to president roosevelt  it concluded that    the blame for the loss of life can be placed on  inefficiency  indifference  and ignorance   inefficiency in the setup of the camps  indifference of someone in charge as to the safety of the men  ignorance of the real danger from a tropical hurricane  and these  i s  can be added together and they spell  murder at matacombe  committee early in its investigation noticed a tendency on the part of some to reflect on the character of the men who were veterans in the camps  several parties referred to them as  bums    drunkards    crazy men   "riff-raff"  and the like  they seem to think that  they got what was coming to them  how anyone could arrive at such a conclusion is impossible for us to determine if these men were  bums    drunkards    crazy men  etc  then it was all the more necessary that every precaution be taken to protect them  if they fell into this category they were subnormal men and should have been treated as such  if they were incapable of caring for themselves then the government should have placed them in hospitals and not have sent them to a wilderness in the high-seas  on a so called  rehabilitation program  williams prepared a response for the president stating   a final report  based upon the facts obtained in this investigation the va and fera

november 14,  1937,  with several hundred people hines had been invited to speak but he his attitude to the project was unenthusiastic  in a letter to williams on june 24,  1937,  regarding what to do with the many skeletons of veterans recently discovered in the keys  he wrote  ″it occurs to me that if a large memorial is erected adjacent to this highway at the place of the disaster it will be observed by all persons using the highway and will serve as a constant reminder of the unfortunate catastrophe which hines recommended the remains be buried at woodlawn  a frieze depicts palm trees

roosevelt s order that hines provide a burial with full military honors for every veteran not claimed by his family on february 18,  1939,  president roosevelt had the opportunity to see the memorial for himself  his motorcade passed through islamorada on the way to key west where he was to begin a visit with the battle fleet on maneuvers  but there is no record that he made a stop  no mention in newspaper the president’s daily or in a press held during a lunch stop at the ccc camp on west summerland key  renamed scout key in 2010).  this omission is puzzling in that he had sent a telegram to

anthologized in 1990:
