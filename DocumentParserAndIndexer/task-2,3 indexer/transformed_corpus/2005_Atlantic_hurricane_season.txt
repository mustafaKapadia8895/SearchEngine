 the 2005  atlantic hurricane season was the most active atlantic hurricane season in recorded history  shattering numerous records  the impact of the season was widespread and ruinous with an estimated 3,913  deaths and damage of about $158.9  billion  the second-costliest  on record  of the storms that made landfall  five of the season s seven major hurricanes—dennis  emily  katrina  rita  and wilma—were responsible for most of the destruction  stan was the most destructive storm that was not a major hurricane  the mexican states of quintana roo and yucatán and the us states of florida and louisiana were each struck twice by major hurricanes  cuba  the bahamas  haiti  mississippi  texas  alabama  and tamaulipas were each struck once and in each case brushed by at least one more  the most catastrophic effects of the season were felt on the united states  gulf coast  where a 30  ft (10  m  storm surge from hurricane katrina caused devastating flooding that destroyed most structures on the mississippi coastline  subsequent levee failures in new orleans  louisiana caused by the storm crippled the city  furthermore  hurricane stan combined with an extratropical system to cause deadly mudslides across central america  with guatemala being hardest-hit.the  2005  season was the first to observe more tropical storms and hurricanes in the atlantic than the west pacific  on average  the latter experiences 26  tropical storms while the atlantic only averages 12.  this event was repeated in the 2010  season  however  the 2010  typhoon season broke the record for the fewest storms observed in a single year  while the 2005  typhoon season featured near average activity the season officially began on june 1,  2005,  and lasted until november 30,  although it effectively persisted into january 2006  due to continued storm activity  a record twenty-eight  tropical and subtropical storms formed  of which a record fifteen became hurricanes  of these  a record-tying  seven strengthened into major hurricanes  a record-tying  five became category 4  hurricanes and a record four reached category 5  strength  the highest categorization for hurricanes on the saffir-simpson  hurricane scale  among these category 5  storms were hurricanes katrina and wilma  respectively the second costliest and the most intense  by lowest pressure  atlantic hurricanes on record  this season was also notable because the list of storm names was used up and six greek letter names had to be used forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert william m  gray and his associates at colorado state university  csu   and separately by forecasters with the u s  government s national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa   prior to and during the 2005  season  gray issued four forecasts  each time increasing the predicted level of activity  the noaa issued two forecasts  one shortly before the season and one two months into the season  drastically increasing the predicted level of activity in the second release  nonetheless  all forecasts fell far short of the actual activity of the season on december 3,  2004,  gray s team issued its first extended-range  forecast for the 2005  season  predicting a slightly above-average  season  additionally  the team predicted a greatly increased chance of a major hurricane striking the east coast of the united states and the florida peninsula  though the forecast predicted above-average  activity  the level predicted was significantly less than the 2004  on april 1,  2005,  after confirming that el niño conditions would not develop  gray and his team revised the december forecast upward  expecting 13  tropical storms instead of 11  and seven hurricanes instead of six  in addition  the chance of a storm impacting the united states was raised on may 16,  2005,  16  days before the season began  noaa issued its outlook for the 2005  season  forecasting a 70%  chance of above-normal  activity  the accumulated cyclone energy  ace  value for the season was predicted to be 120–190%  of the median ace of 87.5  × 104  shortly thereafter  on may 31,  the day before the season officially began  gray s team revised its april forecast upwards to 15  named storms  8  hurricanes  and 4  major august 2,  after an extraordinarily active early season  the noaa released an updated outlook on the remainder of the season  significantly raising the expected level of activity to numbers about double those of a normal season  the ace value was now forecast to be 180  to 270%  of the median  the noaa also noted a higher than normal confidence in the forecast of above-normal  on august 5,  2005,  gray and his associates followed suit and issued their updated forecast  it was consistent with noaa s although neither the noaa nor gray had ever forecast such high levels of activity  even the midseason outlooks fell far short of the actual level of activity  the actual ace would prove to be 248  × 104  — 277%  of the median on june 8,  nearly two months earlier than when the 2004  season started  tropical storm arlene formed in the western caribbean  crossing cuba before making landfall on the florida panhandle on june 11.  arlene caused only moderate damage  although one swimmer was caught in a riptide and drowned in miami beach  storm bret formed in the bay of campeche on june 28  and made landfall in veracruz the next morning  the storm damaged hundreds of homes and caused flooding which killed two cindy formed in the gulf of mexico on july 4.  originally thought to be a tropical storm  cindy made landfall in louisiana on july 5  as a minimal hurricane  dropping up to five in (130  mm  of rain  spawning several tornadoes  flooding some coastal areas including coden  alabama  and killing three people  cindy was upgraded to a hurricane in the post-storm  july 5,  hurricane dennis formed in the eastern caribbean  it crossed grenada before intensifying into a category 4  hurricane  the strongest ever recorded in july with a pressure of 930  mbar  hpa   dennis struck cuba at full force  then made a final landfall on the florida panhandle  the hurricane killed 89  people  mostly in haiti  and caused $4–$6  billion (2005  usd  $4.91  billion – $7.36  billion 2017  usd  in damage in cuba and the united thereafter  hurricane emily formed in the atlantic on july 11.  it entered the caribbean sea and quickly intensified to a category 4  storm  breaking dennis s record for july intensity when its pressure reached 929  mbar  hpa   emily then briefly reached category 5  intensity—the earliest such storm ever recorded in the atlantic  emily crossed the yucatán peninsula at category 4  strength before hitting tamaulipas at category 3  strength  emily killed at least 14  people over the course of its path  an estimated $400  million (2005  usd  $491  million 2017  usd  in damage was storm franklin formed off the bahamas on july 18.  the storm moved northeast and became extratropical off the coast of atlantic canada without ever having threatened storm gert followed soon after on july 24.  gert struck veracruz near where emily had hit a few days before  roughly 1,000  people were evacuated for fear of flooding  but no damage or deaths were july  august also got off to a fast start  tropical storm harvey formed southwest of bermuda on august 3.  harvey dropped some rain on bermuda as it moved to the northeast  it became extratropical on august 8  in the open atlantic tropical depression that would become hurricane irene formed west of the cape verde islands on august 4.  the system moved west and north and did not reach hurricane strength until august 14,  at which point it became the second cape verde-type  hurricane of the season  irene turned northeast and briefly reached category 2  status before weakening and becoming extratropical on august 18.  it never posed a threat to depression ten formed east of the lesser antilles on august 13.  the system dissipated the next day  its remnants soon merged with another system and eventually contributed to the formation of hurricane storm jose followed  forming in the bay of campeche on august 22.  it strengthened rapidly but quickly reached the coast and made landfall in the mexican state of veracruz on august 23,  preventing further strengthening  jose forced 25,000  people to evacuate their homes in veracruz and killed six people in the state of oaxaca  two more were reported in all  damage in mexico amounted to $45  million (2005  usd  $55.2  million 2017  katrina formed in mid-august  over the bahamas  it became a tropical storm on august 24  and reached hurricane intensity before making landfall in south florida as a minimal hurricane  a few hours later  the storm entered the gulf of mexico and intensified rapidly into a category 5  hurricane while crossing the loop current on august 28.  katrina made landfall shortly after 06:00  cst on august 29  near the mouth of the mississippi river as an extremely large category 3  hurricane  category 5-level  storm surges  as the storm had weakened only in the previous several hours  caused catastrophic damage along the coastlines of louisiana  mississippi  and alabama  within hours  levees separating lake pontchartrain from new orleans  louisiana were breached by the surge  ultimately flooding about 80%  of the city  wind damage was reported well inland  impeding relief efforts  katrina is estimated to be responsible for at least $108  billion (2005  usd  $132  billion in 2017  usd  in damage  breaking hurricane andrew s record in 1992  and making it the costliest natural disaster in u s  history until harvey surpassed it in 2017.  it was the deadliest u s  hurricane since the 1928  okeechobee hurricane  killing at least 1,836  people  the 1900  galveston hurricane remains the deadliest natural disaster in united states history  with a death toll of approximately august 24,  a vigorous tropical wave developed off the coast of africa which eventually spawned an area of low pressure  the low gradually became better organized and was designated tropical depression thirteen on august 28,  about midway between the lesser antilles and africa  however  northerly wind shear prevented the depression from strengthening and it degenerated into a broad low-pressure  area the next day  after traveling rapidly towards the north the low regenerated into a tropical depression and shortly after was declared tropical storm lee on august 31.  lee was only briefly a tropical storm before it weakened back to a tropical depression  the depression degenerated into a broad low-pressure  area again before being absorbed by a cold front on september maria led off the month of september  and formed into a tropical storm well east of the leeward islands on september 2.  maria reached its peak as a category 3  hurricane on september 5,  turning northeast and weakening before becoming extratropical on september 10.  unusually  this extratropical storm strengthened as it moved toward iceland  its remnants struck norway where one person was killed in a nate formed southwest of bermuda on september 5  and moved northeast as it strengthened into a strong category 1  hurricane  nate became extratropical on september 10;  the storm never approached land  although it did interfere with canadian naval vessels en route to the gulf coast to help in katrina relief ophelia formed as a tropical depression in the bahamas on september 6  and almost immediately made landfall on grand bahama  it became a tropical storm off the coast of florida before strengthening into a large category 1  storm and raking a long stretch of the southern north carolina coast with heavy winds and storm surge on september 12  and september 13.  the hurricane s eye never made landfall and moved back out to sea before becoming extratropical on september 17  and striking atlantic canada  total damage estimates were around $70  million (2005  philippe formed east of the leeward islands on september 17.  it moved northwards  reaching category 1  intensity before weakening and dissipating on september 23.  no landmasses were affected  although bermuda s lowest pressure of september was recorded after philippe passed near the rita formed as a tropical storm over the turks and caicos islands on september 18.  the storm reached category 2  intensity as it moved south of the florida keys on september 20.  rapid intensification ensued as rita moved into the gulf of mexico  and rita became a category 5  hurricane on september 21,  becoming the third  now fourth  most intense hurricane ever recorded in the atlantic basin  rita made landfall near the texas-louisiana  border on september 24.  major flooding was reported in port arthur and beaumont  texas  while cameron and calcasieu parishes in louisiana were devastated  offshore oil platforms throughout rita s path also suffered significant damage  six people are confirmed dead from rita s direct effects  and total damage from the storm is estimated at about $10  billion (2005  usd  $12.3  billion 2017  usd   one hundred and thirteen indirect deaths were reported  mostly from the exodus from houston  texas and surrounding depression nineteen formed west of the cape verde islands on september 30  but dissipated on october 2  without having threatened stan was the first october storm  reaching tropical storm status on october 2  just before crossing the yucatán peninsula  in the bay of campeche  stan briefly reached hurricane strength before making landfall south of veracruz  veracruz  on october 4.  stan was a part of a large system of rainstorms  which dropped torrential rainfall that caused catastrophic flooding and mudslides over southern mexico and central america  well over 1,000  total deaths were caused by the flooding  of which 80–100  are directly attributed to initially unnoticed unnamed subtropical storm was discovered by the nhc during the postseason analysis  this short-lived  subtropical storm formed on october 4  south of the azores and was absorbed by an extratropical low the next day  after passing over those storm tammy led a brief existence before making landfall in northeastern florida on october 5.  tammy dropped heavy rains over portions of the southeast united states before merging with a frontal system that would eventually cause the northeast u s  flooding of october depression twenty-two  formed southeast of bermuda on october 8.  it dissipated the next day  although its remnants approached new england and contributed to the northeast u s  flooding of october vince formed over unfavorably cold water in the east atlantic near the madeira islands on october 8  as a subtropical storm  this hurricane was first recorded by the nhc on october 9  when it became tropical  and shortly thereafter  it briefly strengthened into a hurricane  the storm made an even more unusual landfall in spain on october 11,  making it the first tropical cyclone to impact spain since the 1842  spain wilma formed on october 17  in the western caribbean southwest of jamaica and rapidly strengthened  on october 19  it became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the atlantic basin  with 185  mph (295  km h  winds and a central pressure of 882  millibars (26.0  inhg   it then moved slowly and struck quintana roo on october 22  as a category 4  hurricane  causing very heavy damage to cancún and cozumel  likewise  after emerging into the gulf of mexico  wilma sharply changed directions and passed north of cuba before striking southern florida on the 24th  as a category 3  storm  then moving into the atlantic ocean and becoming extratropical  wilma is directly credited with 23  deaths  total damage is estimated at around $29  billion (2005  usd  $35.6  billion 2017  usd   mostly in the united states  mexico  and storm alpha formed in the eastern caribbean on october 22  and crossed hispaniola  causing major flooding before merging with wilma  a total of 42  people are reported dead from the storm in haiti and the dominican beta formed in the southern caribbean on october 26  and strengthened into a category 3  hurricane before making landfall in the colombian islands of san andrés   providencia and in nicaragua on october as of 2012,  hurricane beta was responsible for nine fatalities and more than $15.5  million in damage across four countries tropical activity declined very slowly as the season wound down  tropical storm gamma initially formed on november 15  in the central caribbean  and degenerated into a tropical wave before reforming  although the storm dissipated on november 20  after having made landfall in northern honduras  rainfall from gamma caused 41  deaths in honduras and storm delta formed in the eastern atlantic on november 23;  it approached but never attained hurricane strength  delta became extratropical on november 28  shortly before striking the canary islands at full force  causing seven deaths and toppling el dedo de dios  a famous land formation on gran epsilon formed as a tropical storm on november 29  in a hostile environment in the middle of the atlantic  it reached hurricane strength on december 2  and defied forecasting by persisting for over a week before storm zeta became the final storm of the season when it formed on december 30,  six hours short of tying the record of hurricane alice of 1954  as the latest-forming  named storm in a season  zeta dissipated on january 6,  2006,  having become the longest-lived  january tropical cyclone in atlantic basin storms of the season were extraordinarily damaging and were responsible for significant loss of life  total damage is estimated to be about $159.2  billion (2005  us    and an estimated 2,067  people were confirmed dead  however  due to uncertainties in the death toll caused by stan  the death toll from the season could be as high as 4,000  hardest-hit  area was the united states gulf coast from eastern texas to the florida panhandle  first to strike the area was hurricane dennis  which caused $2.23  billion in damage along the florida hurricane katrina caused catastrophic damage to the gulf coast  devastating a long stretch of coast along louisiana  mississippi  and alabama with a 30-foot  (9  m  storm surge  wind damage was reported well inland  slowing down recovery efforts  storm surge also breached levees in the city of new orleans  louisiana  flooding about 80%  of the city  total damage has been estimated at $108  billion  and at least 1,836  people were killed by the storm  katrina is the second costliest hurricane in u s  history  surpassing 1992's  hurricane andrew  and the deadliest hurricane in the u s  since hurricane rita struck near the same area  re-flooded  new orleans  though to a far less degree than katrina   and caused extensive damage along the coastlines of louisiana and texas  total damage is estimated at about $12  tropical storm arlene and hurricane cindy also struck the gulf coast but caused much lighter mexican state of quintana roo was also heavily hit  suffering billions of dollars in damage when hurricanes emily and wilma both made landfall between cozumel and cancún  wilma was particularly devastating  lashing the area with major hurricane-force  winds for over a full day  and was possibly the most damaging hurricane in mexican caused widespread heavy damage in south florida  causing $20.6  billion in damage total in the united hurricanes katrina and rita had struck the same area earlier  causing lesser  but still significant  damage  and tropical storm arlene killed one person caught in a rip hurricane dennis also brushed the area on its track october the remnants of tropical storm tammy and subtropical depression twenty-two  met over the northeastern united states  causing intense north carolina suffered some damage from the slow-moving  hurricane ophelia  damage from that storm were originally estimated at $1.6  billion  but finalized at only $70  million  the remainder of the atlantic coast escaped the major storms  although some regions were affected by the remnants of several storms  including katrina  ophelia  tammy  subtropical depression twenty-two,  and mexico  including veracruz and tamaulipas  was struck repeatedly  hurricane emily struck tamaulipas directly  causing severe damage  tropical storms bret  gert  and jose also made landfall in the area but caused minimal damage  although they did cause 12  mexico  along with portions of central america  suffered heavy flooding and mudslides from hurricane stan and nearby nontropical rains  over 1,600  people were confirmed dead in total  with some towns completely wiped out  though most of these deaths were not directly related to the hurricane  central america also suffered flooding from tropical storm gamma and hurricane wilma  and nicaragua was struck directly by hurricane beta  gamma caused $13–18  million (2005  usd  in damage to crops  no damage figures are available for any of the other island of hispaniola escaped the worst storms  however  at least 89  people were killed in haiti from the effects of hurricanes dennis and wilma and tropical storm alpha  the leeward islands were generally spared all the although dennis and emily caused significant damage in the windward was struck by hurricane dennis at peak strength  causing $1.4  billion in damage  it was the worst hurricane to hit cuba in over 40  years  some areas of cuba also suffered heavy damage from hurricanes rita and impacts were felt in europe and nearby islands from four storms  hurricane maria intensified and affected northern europe as a vicious extratropical storm  while hurricane vince maintained tropical characteristics onto the iberian peninsula as a weak tropical depression  tropical storm delta struck the canary islands just after becoming extratropical  causing extensive damage before reaching morocco as a weak extratropical system  in addition  the azores were affected by the unnamed subtropical storm at its peak strength  eight people were killed by those storms  and significant damage was reported as a result of maria and delta  although no figures are damage had far-reaching  economic consequences due to vulnerability of both oil extracting and refining capacity in the gulf of mexico  storms led to speculative spikes in the price of crude oil whereas  the damage to refinery capacity in the united states caused gasoline to soar to record prices  even adjusted for inflation   governments in europe and the united states tapped strategic reserves of gasoline and petroleum  and shortages were reported in the days after katrina in areas heavily dependent on the gulf of mexico for refined gasoline  even weeks after the storm  prices remained elevated as the shortage in production remained over 1  million barrels (160,000  m3)  per damaged wells in the western gulf of mexico which were primarily exploratory  leading to concerns that future production would be damped for some time to come  additionally  as the storm churned in the gulf  forecasters predicted that it would strike houston  texas  the location of many major oil refineries that survived katrina  leading to additional spikes in oil prices before the predictions changed  in georgia  governor sonny perdue declared  snow days  on september 26  and september 27,  2005,  at all georgia public schools to conserve fuel for school buses in anticipation of rita s impact  however  as the storm veered away from houston shortly before landfall  damage to refining capacity was not as great as in multiple countries was hard hit by extremely heavy rains from severe storms during the season  early in the season  hurricane dennis caused significant damage to various citrus and vegetable crops in cuba  though the damage was not in central america  hurricane stan and associated nontropical storms dropped upwards of 20  inches (500  mm  of rain  causing  in addition to severe flash floods and mud slides  heavy damage to crops  especially to the banana and coffee crops  which were nearly ready to be harvested  this caused significant economic disruption in guatemala and surrounding nations  as the rural economies are highly dependent on the coffee and banana when hurricane beta struck nicaragua later in the season  it also caused heavy damage to the banana crop  but the harvests had already ended  mitigating economic also had significant political consequences  as president george w  bush  louisiana governor kathleen blanco  and new orleans mayor ray nagin all came under heavy criticism for what were considered sluggish or inappropriate responses to hurricane katrina  on december 14,  2005,  congressional hearings began to investigate whether these claims had any merit  in addition  michael brown  head of the united states federal emergency management agency  fema   was forced to resign from his post after the organization came under fire for what was perceived as an insufficient response to number of storms that formed in 2005  exhibited unusual behavior and challenged forecasters  ability to make correct predictions  hurricane vince formed farther northeast in the atlantic than any other tropical cyclone on record at the time—only 2009's  grace has formed farther north—and then unexpectedly reached hurricane strength over waters considered too cold to support a hurricane wilma became the fastest-intensifying  hurricane on record  and later strengthened unexpectedly in the face of strong wind tropical storm delta  hurricane epsilon and tropical storm zeta all formed over the cold waters of the late-season  eastern atlantic  much like hurricane vince  though at lower latitudes   all three persisted in the face of heavy wind shear  and epsilon managed to reach hurricane strength over waters well below the temperatures previously thought necessary for hurricane formation  epsilon became the longest-lasting  december while zeta became the longest-lasting  storm in 2005  season broke numerous records for tropical cyclone though it might not actually be the most active season in history  since records before 1944  are the season 28  storms formed (27  named and one unnamed   surpassing almost all records for storm formation in the atlantic  more tropical storms  hurricanes  major hurricanes and category 5  hurricanes formed during the season than in any previously recorded atlantic season the season was the first season to use  v  and  w  names  and when the season ran out of official alphabetical names after the use of wilma  forecasters resorted to using letters from the greek alphabet for the first time  although alpha and delta had been used for subtropical storms in the 1970s).almost  every storm in 2005  set a record for early formation  of the twenty-eight  storms which formed  twenty-two  of them qualified as the earliest-forming  storm of that number  starting with hurricane dennis  almost every storm was such   the record set by dennis was later broken by debby in 2012,  which was again broken in 2016  with needed  the season s activity was reflected with a very high cumulative accumulated cyclone energy  ace  rating of 250.  this total ranks it as the second-most  active season on record  with only the 1933  season having a higher ace ace is  broadly speaking  a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed  so storms that last a long time  as well as particularly strong hurricanes  have high aces  ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34  knots (39  mph  63  km h  or tropical storm strength  although officially  subtropical cyclones are excluded from the the figure above includes

 inhg  minimum pressure  shattering the 17-year-old  record set by hurricane hurricanes emily  katrina and rita also attained category 5  intensity  and hurricanes rita and katrina became the fourth-  and sixth-most  intense recorded atlantic storms  respectively  hurricane emily was not originally recorded as a category 5  storm  but it was upgraded into the post-storm  status by the national hurricane the 2005  season is the only season on record with four category 5  storms on the saffir-simpson  hurricane scale  the previous record was only two  in addition  hurricane dennis reached category 4  status  tying the record set by the 1999  season with five category 4  storms in july  hurricane dennis became the strongest storm to form prior to august and the earliest category 4  storm to form in the when hurricane emily reached category 5  intensity later in the month  the 2005  season became the only season to have two hurricanes reach category 4  intensity before the end of july  emily also broke dennis s nine-day-old  record for the strongest storm on record before august  emily was also the first category 5  hurricane ever recorded in july and the earliest by nearly three weeks  beating hurricane allen   the high level of activity and strength was reflected in the accumulated cyclone energy value at the end of july  at 63  it was the highest ever additionally  seven storms formed before the end of july  breaking the record of five set in the 1887,  1933,  1936,  1959,  1966,  and 1995  seasons  five of those storms formed during july  also a new needed

second-strongest  hurricane ever recorded in the month of december  only hurricane nicole of 1998  was needed when tropical storm zeta formed on december 30,  it came second only to hurricane alice  also december 30,  1954,  but later in the day  as the latest ever that the last storm of the season formed  zeta also became only the second storm  after alice  to persist through the end of the year and still be active at the start of the needed the following is a list of names used for tropical storms and hurricanes that formed in the north atlantic in 2005.this  was the same list used for the 1999  season  with the exceptions of franklin and lee  which replaced floyd and lenny  the names not retired from this list were used again in the 2011  atlantic hurricane season  storms were named

alpha and delta had been previously used in 1972  for two subtropical storms  but this is the first time they have been used in this way   this season used fifteen previously unused names  the most ever in an atlantic season  additionally  a subtropical storm that formed in early october was not recognized as such at the time and so did not receive a name  vince and wilma were the first named  v
