 wind shear  or windshear   sometimes referred to as wind gradient  is a difference in wind speed and or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere  atmospheric wind shear is normally described as either vertical or horizontal wind shear  vertical wind shear is a change in wind speed or direction with change in altitude  horizontal wind shear is a change in wind speed with change in lateral position for a given shear is a microscale meteorological phenomenon occurring over a very small distance  but it can be associated with mesoscale or synoptic scale weather features such as squall lines and cold fronts  it is commonly observed near microbursts and downbursts caused by thunderstorms  fronts  areas of locally higher low-level  winds referred to as low level jets  near mountains  radiation inversions that occur due to clear skies and calm winds  buildings  wind turbines  and sailboats  wind shear has significant effects on control of an aircraft effect  and it has been a sole or contributing cause of many aircraft accidents wind shear is sometimes experienced by pedestrians at ground level when walking across a plaza towards a tower block and suddenly encountering a strong wind stream that is flowing around the base of the tower sound movement through the atmosphere is affected by wind shear  which can bend the wave front  causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not  or vice versa  strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development  but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into longer life cycles which can then produce severe weather  the thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed at different heights are dependent on horizontal temperature differences  and explains the existence of the jet shear refers to the variation of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances  airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30  knots (15  m s  for light aircraft  and near 45  knots (22  m s  for airliners at flight vertical speed changes greater than 4.9  knots (2.5  m s  also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft  low level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during take off and landing in disastrous ways  and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear  headwind loss in excess of 30  the rationale for this additional caution includes  (1)  microburst intensity can double in a minute or less  (2)  the winds can shift to excessive cross wind  (3)  40-50  knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude  operations  and (4)  several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45  knot microbursts  wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms  the additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear weather situations where shear is observed include weather fronts are boundaries between two masses of air of different densities  or different temperature and moisture properties  which normally are convergence zones in the wind field and are the principal cause of significant weather  within surface weather analyses  they are depicted using various colored lines and symbols  the air masses usually differ in temperature and may also differ in humidity  wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries  cold fronts feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather  and may be preceded by squall lines and dry lines  cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts  when a front becomes stationary  it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed  known as a shear line  though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant  in the tropics  tropical waves move from east to west across the atlantic and eastern pacific basins  directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves  as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis  horizontal wind shear can also occur along local land breeze and sea breeze magnitude of winds offshore are nearly double the wind speed observed onshore  this is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters  sometimes  there are even directional differences  particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore during daylight wind is a meteorological term not referring to an actual wind  but a difference in the geostrophic wind between two pressure levels p 1    displaystyle p_{1}}  and p 0    displaystyle p_{0}}    with p 1    p 0    displaystyle p_{1}<p_{0}}    in essence  wind shear  it is only present in an atmosphere with horizontal changes in temperature  or in an ocean with horizontal gradients of density   i e  baroclinicity  in a barotropic atmosphere  where temperature is uniform  the geostrophic wind is independent of height  the name stems from the fact that this wind flows around areas of low  and high  temperature in the same manner as the geostrophic wind flows around areas of low  and high  thermal wind equation iswhere the ϕ x   displaystyle  phi   x   are geopotential height fields with ϕ 1    ϕ 0    displaystyle  phi _{1}>\phi  _{0}}    f   displaystyle f  is the coriolis parameter  and k   displaystyle  mathbf  k    is the upward-pointing  unit vector in the vertical direction  the thermal wind equation does not determine the wind in the tropics  since f   displaystyle f  is small or zero  such as near the equator  the equation reduces to stating that ∇   ϕ 1  − ϕ 0      displaystyle  nabla   phi _{1}-\phi  _{0})}  is equation basically describes the existence of the jet stream  a westerly current of air with maximum wind speeds close to the tropopause which is  even though other factors are also important  the result of the temperature contrast between equator and pole tropical cyclones are basically heat engines that are fueled by the temperature gradient between the warm tropical ocean surface and the colder upper atmosphere  tropical cyclone development requires relatively low values of vertical wind shear so that their warm core can remain above their surface circulation center  thereby promoting intensification  vertical wind shear tears up the  machinery  of the heat engine causing it to break down  strongly sheared tropical cyclones weaken as the upper circulation is blown away from the low level center the vertical wind shear in a tropical cyclone s environment is very important  when the wind shear is weak  the storms that are part of the cyclone grow vertically  and the latent heat from condensation is released into the air directly above the storm  aiding in development  when there is stronger wind shear  this means that the storms become more slanted and the latent heat release is dispersed over a much larger area thunderstorms  which can spawn tornadoes and hailstorms  require wind shear to organize the storm in such a way as to maintain the thunderstorm for a longer period of time  this occurs as the storm s inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled  outflow  an increasing nocturnal  or overnight  low level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical wind shear through the troposphere  thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions  which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm  moist air and kills the atmospheric effect of surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise near the surface of the earth blowing inward across isobars  lines of equal pressure   when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the earth s this layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer  sometimes the ekman layer  and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night  daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation  or solar heating  radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear  these wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft  and is most emphasized at night in gliding  wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider  wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches  also known as winch launches or wire launches  if the wind gradient is significant or sudden  or both  and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude  the indicated airspeed will increase  possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed  the pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the landing  wind shear is also a hazard  particularly when the winds are strong  as the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing  airspeed decreases while sink rate increases  and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact  the pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for shear is also a hazard for aircraft making steep turns near the ground  it is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan  which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle  the different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing  causing a loss of control shear or wind gradients are a threat to parachutists  particularly to base jumping and wingsuit flying  skydivers have been pushed off of their course by sudden shifts in wind direction and speed  and have collided with bridges  cliffsides  trees  other skydivers  the ground  and other needed  skydivers routinely make adjustments to the position of their open canopies to compensate for changes in direction while making landings to prevent accidents such as canopy collisions and canopy inversion soaring related to wind shear  also called dynamic soaring  is a technique used by soaring birds like albatrosses  who can maintain flight without wing flapping  if the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude  a bird can climb into the wind gradient  trading ground speed for height  while maintaining by then turning downwind  and diving through the wind gradient  they can also gain it has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions wind shear can also create wave  this occurs when an atmospheric inversion separates two layers with a marked difference in wind direction  if the wind encounters distortions in the inversion layer caused by thermals coming up from below  it will create significant shear waves that can be used for outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three-dimensional  wind velocity just above ground level  initially  this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed  which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear  as the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft  the localized headwind diminishes  reducing the aircraft s airspeed and increasing its sink rate  then  when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft  the headwind becomes a tailwind  reducing lift generated by the wings  and leaving the aircraft in a low-power,  low-speed  descent  this can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact as the result of the accidents in the 1970s  and 1980s,  most notably following the 1985  crash of delta air lines flight 191,  in 1988  the u s  federal aviation administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board  wind shear detection systems by 1993.  between 1964  and 1985,  wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26  major civil transport aircraft accidents in the u s  that led to 620  deaths and 200  since 1995,  the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years  due to the mandated on-board  detection as well as the addition of doppler weather radar units on the ground needed  the installation of high-resolution  terminal doppler weather radar stations at many u s  airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear shear affects sailboats in motion by presenting a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast  the effect of low level wind shear can be factored into the selection of sail twist in the sail design  but this can be difficult to predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions  sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low level wind shear  for example using a boom shear can have a pronounced effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere  where waves can be  bent  by refraction phenomenon  the audibility of sounds from distant sources  such as thunder or gunshots  is very dependent on the amount of shear  the result of these differing sound levels is key in noise pollution considerations  for example from roadway noise and aircraft noise  and must be considered in the design of noise this phenomenon was first applied to the field of noise pollution study in the 1960s,  contributing to the design of urban highways as well as noise speed of sound varies with temperature  since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude  sound is refracted upward  away from listeners on the ground  creating an acoustic shadow at some distance from the in the 1862,  during the american civil war battle of iuka  an acoustic shadow  believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind  kept two divisions of union soldiers out of the because they could not hear the sounds of battle only six miles engineering is a field of engineering devoted to the analysis of wind effects on the natural and built environment  it includes strong winds which may cause discomfort as well as extreme winds such as tornadoes  hurricanes and storms which may cause widespread destruction  wind engineering draws upon meteorology  aerodynamics and a number of specialist engineering disciplines  the tools used include climate models  atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels and numerical models  it involves  among other topics  how wind impacting buildings must be accounted for in turbines are affected by wind shear  vertical wind-speed  profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those at the top of blade travel  and this in turn affects the turbine this low level wind shear can create a large bending moment in the shaft of a two bladed turbine when the blades are the reduced wind shear over water means shorter and less expensive wind turbine towers can be used in shallow
