 in greek mythology  the titans  greek  τιτάν  titán  plural  τiτᾶνες  titânes  and titanesses  or titanides  greek  τιτανίς  titanís  plural  τιτανίδες  titanídes  were members of the second generation of divine beings  descending from the primordial deities and preceding the olympian deities  based on mount othrys  the titans most famously included the first twelve children of the primordial gaia  mother earth  and uranus  father sky   they were giant deities of incredible strength  who ruled during the legendary golden age  and also comprised the first pantheon of greek deities the first twelve titans comprised the females mnemosyne  tethys  theia  phoebe  rhea  and themis and the males oceanus  hyperion  coeus  cronus  crius  and iapetus a second set of titans consisted of hyperion s children helios  selene  and eos  coeus  children lelantos  leto  and asteria  iapetus  sons atlas  prometheus  epimetheus  and menoetius  oceanus  daughter metis  and crius  sons astraeus  pallas  and perses like cronus overthrowing his father uranus  the titans were overthrown by cronus s children  zeus  hades  poseidon  hestia  hera and demeter   in the titanomachy  or  war of the titans    the greeks may have borrowed this mytheme from the ancient near of the classical age knew several poems about the war between the olympians and titans  the dominant one  and the only one that has survived  was in the theogony attributed to hesiod  a lost epic  titanomachia  attributed to the legendary blind thracian bard thamyris  was mentioned in passing in an essay on music that was once attributed to plutarch  the titans also played a prominent role in the poems attributed to orpheus  although only scraps of the orphic narratives survive  they show interesting differences with the hesiodic tradition the classical greek myths of the titanomachy fall into a class of similar myths throughout europe and the near east concerning a war in heaven  where one generation or group of gods largely opposes the dominant one  sometimes the elders are supplanted  and sometimes the rebels lose and are either cast out of power entirely or incorporated into the pantheon  other examples might include the wars of the æsir with the vanir in scandinavian mythology  the babylonian epic enuma elish  the hittite  kingship in heaven  narrative  the obscure generational conflict in ugaritic fragments  virabhadra s conquest of the early vedic gods  and the rebellion of lucifer in christianity  the titanomachy lasted for ten the titans were imprisoned in tartarus after the war had ended  tartarus is said to be the deepest part of the underworld and the place where the evilest beings are tortured for all eternity hesiod does not have the last word on the titans  surviving fragments of poetry ascribed to orpheus preserve some variations on the myth  in such text  zeus does not simply set upon his father violently  instead  rhea spreads out a banquet for cronus so that he becomes drunk upon fermented honey  rather than being consigned to tartarus  cronus is dragged – still drunk – to the cave of nyx  night   where he continues to dream throughout eternity another myth concerning the titans that is not in hesiod revolves around dionysus  at some point in his reign  zeus decides to give up the throne in favor of the infant dionysus  who like the infant zeus  is guarded by the kouretes  the titans decide to slay the child and claim the throne for themselves  they paint their faces white with gypsum  distract dionysus with toys  then dismember him and boil and roast his limbs  zeus  enraged  slays the titans with his thunderbolt  athena preserves the heart in a gypsum doll  out of which a new dionysus is made  this story is told by the poets callimachus and nonnus  who call this dionysus  zagreus   and in a number of orphic texts  which do not one iteration of this story  of the late antique neoplatonist philosopher olympiodorus  recounted in his commentary of plato s affirms that humanity sprang up out of the fatty smoke of the burning titan corpses  pindar  plato  and oppian refer offhandedly to the  titanic nature  of humans  according to them  the body is the titanic part  while soul is the divine part of humans  other early writers imply that humanity was born out of the malevolent blood shed by the titans in their war against zeus  some scholars consider that olympiodorus  report  the only surviving explicit expression of this mythic connection  embodied a tradition that dated to the bronze age  while radcliffe edmonds has suggested an element of innovative allegorized improvisation to suit olympiodorus  19th-  and 20th-century  scholars  including jane ellen harrison  have argued that an initiatory or shamanic ritual underlies the myth of the dismemberment and cannibalism of dionysus by the she also asserts that the word  titan  comes from the greek τίτανος  signifying white  earth  clay  or gypsum   and that the titans were  white clay men   or men covered by white clay or gypsum dust in their martin litchfield west also asserts this in relation to shamanistic initiatory rites of early greek religious connects the word with τιτώ  a now-obscure  word for other scholars connect the word to the greek verb τείνω   teino   to stretch   through an epic variation τιταίνω and τίσις  titaino and tisis   retribution  and  vengeance    hesiod appears to share that view when he narrates but their father  great ouranos  called them titans by surname  rebuking his sons  whom he had begotten himself  for he said they had  strained   τιταίνοντας  titainontas  in their wickedness to perform a mighty deed  and at some later time there would be  vengeance   τίσιν  tisin  for this the planet saturn is named for the roman equivalent of the titan cronus  saturn s largest moon  titan  is named after the titans generally  and the other moons of saturn are named after individual titans  specifically tethys  phoebe  rhea  hyperion  and iapetus  astronomer pickering claimed to discover another a moon of saturn which he named themis  but this discovery was never confirmed  and the name themis was given to an asteroid  24  themis  asteroid 57  mnemosyne was also named for a titan a proto-planet  theia is hypothesized to have been involved in a collision in the early solar system  forming the earth s moon
