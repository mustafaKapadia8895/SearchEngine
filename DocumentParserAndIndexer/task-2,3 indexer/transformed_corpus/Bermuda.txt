whom the islands are named  he claimed the islands for the spanish empire  bermúdez never landed on the islands  but made two visits to the archipelago  of which he created a recognisable map

believed to have released pigs there  which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time european settlement began  in 1609,  the english virginia company  which had established jamestown in virginia two years earlier  permanently settled bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane  when the crew and passengers of the sea venture steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent its sinking  then landed ashore the island was administered as an extension of virginia by the company until 1614.  its spin-off,  the somers isles company  took over in 1615  and managed the colony until 1684.  at that time  the company s charter was revoked  and the english crown took over administration  the islands became a british colony following the 1707  unification of the parliaments of

trees to bermuda  coconut palms are found on bermuda  making it the northernmost location for the natural growth of this species  however  the climate is usually too cool to allow the palms to properly set fruit the only indigenous mammals of bermuda are five species of bats  all of which are also found in the eastern united states  lasionycteris noctivagans  lasiurus borealis  lasiurus

question whether it should be classified as a land vertebrate to compete with the skink s unique status bermuda s 2010  census put bermuda s population at 64,237  and  with an area of 53.2  km2  (20.5  sq mi   it has a calculated population density of 1207/km².the  racial makeup of bermuda as recorded by the 2010  census  was 54%  black  31%  white  8%  multiracial  4%  asian  and 4%  other races  although these numbers are based on self-identification,  and the majority of those who answered  black  have any mixture of black  white and indigenous american native-born  bermudians made up 67%  of the population  compared to 29%  non-natives.the  island experienced large-scale  immigration over the 20th  century  especially after the second world war  bermuda has a diverse population including both those with relatively deep roots in bermuda extending back for centuries  and newer communities whose ancestry results from recent immigration  especially from britain  north america  the west indies  and the portuguese atlantic islands  especially the azores   although these groups are steadily merging  about 46%  of the population identified themselves with bermudian ancestry in 2010,  which was a decrease from the 51%  who did so in the 2000  census  those identifying with british ancestry dropped by 1%  to 11%   although those born in britain remain the largest non-native  group at 3,942  persons   the number of people born in canada declined by 13%.  those who reported west indian ancestry were 13%.  the number of people born in the west indies actually increased by 538.  a significant segment of the population is of portuguese ancestry (10%),  the result of immigration over the past 160  of whom 79%  have residency status the deeper ancestral demography of bermuda s population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries  there is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white bermudians  other than those characterising recent immigrant communities  in the 17th  century  this was not so  for the first hundred years of settlement  white protestants of english heritage were the distinct majority  with white minorities of irish  the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been gaelic  and scots sent to bermuda after the english invasions of their homelands that followed the english civil war  non-white  minorities included spanish-speaking,  free  indentured  blacks from the west indies  black chattel slaves primarily captured from spanish and portuguese ships by bermudian privateers  and native americans  primarily from the algonquian and other tribes of the atlantic seaboard  but possibly from as far away as mexico  by the 19th  century  the white ethnically-english  bermudians had lost their numerical advantage  despite the banning of the importation of irish  and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them  the merging of the various minority groups  along with some of the white english  had resulted in a new demographic group   coloured   which term  in bermuda  referred to anyone not wholly of european ancestry  bermudians  gaining a slight majority  any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic  most of those historically described as  coloured  are today described as  black   or  of african heritage   which obscures their non-african  heritage  those previously described as  coloured  who were not of african ancestry had been very few  though the numbers of south asians  particularly  is now growing  the number of persons born in asian countries doubled between the 2000  and the 2010  censuses   blacks have remained in the majority  with new white immigration from portugal  britain and elsewhere countered by black immigration from the west indies bermuda s modern black population contains more than one demographic group  although the number of residents born in africa is very small  it has tripled between 2000  and 2010   this group also includes non-blacks).  the majority of blacks in bermuda can be termed  bermudian blacks   whose ancestry dates back centuries between the 17th  century and the end of slavery in 1834,  bermuda s black population was self-sustaining,  with its growth resulting largely from natural expansion  this contrasts to the enslaved blacks of the plantation colonies  who were subjected to conditions so harsh as to drop their birth rate below the death rate  and slaveholders in the west indies found it necessary to continue importing more enslaved blacks from africa until the end of slavery  the same had been true for the native americans that the africans had replaced on the new world plantations   the indigenous populations of many west indian islands  and much of the south-east  of what is now the united states that had survived the 16th-  and 17th-century  epidemics of european-introduced  diseases then became the victims of large-scale  slave raiding  with much of the region completely depopulated  when the supply of indigenous slaves ran out  the slaveholders looked to africa  the ancestry of bermuda s black population is distinguished from that of the british west indian black population in two ways  first  the higher degree of european and native american admixture  secondly  the source of the african ancestry in the british west indian islands  and also in the united states   the majority of enslaved blacks brought across the atlantic came from west africa  roughly between modern senegal and ghana   very little of bermuda s original black emigration came from this area  the first blacks to arrive in bermuda in any numbers were free blacks from spanish-speaking  areas of the west indies  and most of the remainder were recently enslaved africans captured from the spanish and portuguese  as spain and portugal sourced most of their slaves from south-west  africa  the portuguese through ports in modern-day  angola  the spanish purchased most of their african slaves from portuguese traders  and from arabs whose slave trading was centred in zanzibar   genetic studies have consequently shown that the african ancestry of black bermudians  other than those resulting from recent immigration from the british west indian islands  is largely from a band across southern africa  from angola to mozambique  which is similar to what is revealed in latin america  but distinctly different from the blacks of the west indies and the united states most of bermuda s black population trace some of their ancestry to native americans  although awareness of this is largely limited to st david s islanders and most who have such ancestry are unaware of it  during the colonial period  hundreds of native americans were shipped to bermuda  the best-known  examples were the algonquian peoples who were exiled from the southern new england colonies and sold into slavery in the 17th  century  notably in the aftermaths of the pequot and king philip s wars today several thousand expatriate workers  principally from britain  canada  the west indies  south africa and the us  reside in bermuda  they are primarily engaged in specialised professions such as accounting  finance  and insurance  others are employed in various trades  such as hotels  restaurants  construction  and landscaping services  of the total workforce of 38,947  persons in 2005,  government employment figures stated that 11,223  (29%)  were predominant language on bermuda is bermudian english  it exhibits characteristics of british  west indian  and american english  perhaps most interesting is its closeness to acrolectal english compared to other varieties in the west indies british english spellings and conventions are used in print media and formal written is also spoken in this is owing to immigration from portugal

the 17th  century  and became part of the dominant british culture  english is the primary and official language  due to 160  years of immigration from portuguese atlantic islands  primarily the

of immigration from the west indies was sustained throughout the 20th  century  the more recent arrivals have primarily come from english-speaking  countries  also bringing aspects of their cultures  this new infusion of west indians has both accelerated social and political change  and diversified bermuda s culture the first notable  and historically important  book credited to a bermudian was

his books at the turn of the 19th  and 20th  centuries  in the 20th  century  numerous books were written and published locally  though few were directed at a wider market than bermuda   the latter consisted primarily of scholarly works rather than creative writing   the novelist brian burland (1931–  2010)  achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally  more recently  angela barry has won critical recognition for her published fiction bermuda s proximity to the united states  as well as its origin as part of virginia  means that many aspects of us culture are reflected in  or incorporated into  bermudian culture  many non-bermudian  writers have also made bermuda their home  or have had homes here  including a  j  cronin and f  van wyck mason  who wrote on bermudian subjects actors such as ernest trimingham  oona o neill  earl cameron  diana dill  lena headey  will kempe  and most famously  michael douglas and catherine zeta-jones,  grew up here or have lived here as adults  other native or resident film and television figures in bermuda include producer arthur rankin  jr   and michael frith  an author and puppeteer most well known for his work on the muppets franchise west indian musicians introduced calypso music when bermuda s tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post-second  world war aviation  while calypso appealed more to the visitors than to the locals  reggae has been embraced by many bermudians since the 1970s  with the influx of jamaican immigrants bermuda s early literature consisted of non-bermudian  writers commenting on the island  these included john smith s the generall historie of virginia  new-england,  and the summer isles (1624),  and edmund waller s poem   battle of the

fresh meat and water  legends arose of spirits and devils  now thought to have stemmed from the calls of raucous birds  most likely the bermuda petrel  or cahow  and the loud noise heard at night from wild hogs  combined with the frequent storm-wracked  conditions and the dangerous reefs  the archipelago became known as the isle of devils  neither spain nor portugal attempted to settle it for the next century  the island is believed to have been visited frequently  but not settled  after the failure of the first two english colonies in virginia  a more determined effort was initiated by king james i of england  who granted a royal charter to the virginia company it established a colony at jamestown  virginia  in 1607.  two years later  a flotilla of seven ships left england under the company s admiral  sir george somers  and the new governor of jamestown  sir thomas gates  with several hundred settlers  food and supplies to relieve the colony of somers had previous experience sailing with both sir francis drake and sir walter raleigh  the flotilla was broken up by a storm  as the flagship  the sea venture  was taking on water  somers drove it onto bermuda s reef and gained the shores safely with smaller boats – all 150  passengers and a dog survived   william shakespeare s play the tempest  in which the character ariel refers to the "still-vex'd  bermoothes  (i.ii.229),  is thought to have been inspired by william strachey s account of this they stayed 10  months  starting a new settlement and building two small ships to sail to jamestown  the group of islands were claimed for the english crown  and the charter of the virginia company was later extended to include them in 1610,  all but three of the survivors of the sea venture sailed on to jamestown  among them was john rolfe  whose wife and child died and were buried in bermuda  later in jamestown he married pocahontas  a daughter of the powerful powhatan  leader of a large confederation of about 30  algonquian-speaking  tribes in coastal virginia  in 1612,  the english began intentional settlement of bermuda with the arrival of the ship plough  st  george s was settled that year and designated as bermuda s first capital  it is the oldest continually inhabited english town in the new 1615,  the colony was passed to a new company  the somers isles company  named after the admiral who saved his passengers from the sea many virginian place names refer to the archipelago  such as bermuda city  and bermuda hundred  the first english coins to circulate in north america were struck in bermuda because of its limited land area  bermuda has had difficulty with over-population.  in the first two centuries of settlement  it relied on steady human emigration to keep the population needed  before the american revolution more than ten thousand bermudians  over half of the total population through the years  gradually emigrated  primarily to the southern united states  as great britain displaced spain as the dominant european imperial power  it opened up more land for colonial development  a steady trickle of outward migration continued  with seafaring the only real industry in the early decades  by the end of the 18th  century  at least a third of the island s manpower was at sea at any one time the archipelago s limited land area and resources led to the creation of what may be the earliest conservation laws of the new world  in 1616  and 1620  acts were passed banning the hunting of certain birds and young 1649,  the english civil war was in its seventh year and king charles i was beheaded in whitehall  london  in bermuda  related tensions resulted in civil war on the island  it was ended by militias  the majority of colonists developed a strong sense of devotion to the crown  dissenters  such as puritans and independents  were pushed to settle the bahamas under william bermuda and virginia  as well as antigua and barbados were  however  the subjects of an act of the rump parliament which was essentially a declaration of war  an act prohibiting trade with barbados  virginia  bermuda and antego  specified that due punishment inflicted upon the said delinquents  do declare all and every the said persons in barbada s  antego  bermuda s and virginia  that have contrived  abetted  aided or assisted those horrid rebellions  or have since willingly joyned with them  to be notorious robbers and traitors  and such as by the law of nations are not to be permitted any maner of commerce or traffique with any people whatsoever  and do forbid to all maner of persons

oath the royalist colonies were also threatened with invasion  the government of bermuda eventually reached an agreement with the parliamentarians in england which left the status quo in bermuda in the 17th  century  the somers isles company suppressed shipbuilding  as it needed bermudians to farm in order for it to generate income from the land  agricultural production met with limited success  however  due to limited areas available for cultivation  high alkalinity of the soil  and the depletion of the soil quality that resulted from excessive farming  the bermuda cedar boxes used to ship tobacco to england were reportedly worth more than their needed  the colony of virginia far surpassed bermuda in both quality and quantity of tobacco produced  bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th  century  but the somers isles company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture  this interference led to the islanders demanding  and receiving  the revocation of the company s charter in 1684,  and the company was dissolved bermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding  replanting farmland with the native juniper  juniperus bermudiana  called bermuda cedar  trees that grew thickly over the entire island  establishing effective control over the turks islands  bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade  it became the world s largest and remained the cornerstone of bermuda s economy for the next century bermudian sailors and merchants relied on more than the export of salt  however  they vigorously pursued whaling  privateering  and the merchant trade  vessels sailed the normal shipping routes  but were required to engage an enemy vessel no matter the size or strength  as a result  many ships were needed the bermuda sloop became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability  and was soon adapted for service with the royal navy  the bermuda sloop hms pickle carried despatches of the victory at trafalgar  and news of the death of admiral nelson  to england american independence led to great changes for bermuda  prior to the war  with no useful landmass or natural resources  bermuda was largely ignored and left to its own devices by the london government  by being so deeply involved in trade  bermuda merchants and financiers had played roles out of proportion to the colony s size in relation to the development of the triangle trade  and the trans-atlantic  english and british empires its people were settlers and founders of new colonies  especially in the american south  its merchant fleet and a web of expatriate bermudian merchants dominated trade through a number of american atlantic seaboard ports and the west indies  bermudians fished for cod on the grand banks off newfoundland  and were involved in the lumber industry in central america  most importantly  they dominated the north american salt trade with de facto control of the turks islands the close economic  family  and historical ties ensured bermudians were strongly sympathetic with the rebels at the start of the war  they supplied the rebels illegally with ships  salt and gunpowder  as the war progressed  economic realities caused bermudians to seize opportunities  they turned to privateering against the americans the end of the war  however  was to cause profound change in bermuda  though some of those changes would take decades to crystallise  following the war  with the buildup of naval and military forces in bermuda  the primary leg of the bermudian economy became defence infrastructure  even after tourism began later in the 19th  century  bermuda remained  in the eyes of london  a base more than a colony  the crown strengthened its political and economic ties to bermuda  and the colony s independence on the world stage was diminished the war had removed bermuda s primary trading partners  the american colonies  from the empire  and dealt a harsh blow to bermuda s merchant shipping trade  this also suffered due to the deforestation of bermuda  as well as the advent of metal ships and steam propulsion  for which it did not have raw materials  during the course of the following war of 1812,  the primary market for bermuda s salt disappeared as the americans developed their own sources  control of the turks had passed to the bahamas in 1819.by  the end of the 19th  century  except for naval and military facilities  bermuda was considered a quiet  rustic backwater  it had been superseded in the development of the english-speaking  atlantic world after the american revolution  the royal navy began improving the harbours  in 1811,  it started building the large dockyard on ireland island  in the west of the chain  to serve as its principal naval base guarding the western atlantic ocean shipping lanes  to guard it  the british army built up a large bermuda garrison  and heavily fortified the archipelago during the war of 1812  between britain and the united states  the british attacks on washington  d c  and the chesapeake were planned and launched from bermuda  where the headquarters of the royal navy s north american station had recently been moved from halifax  nova scotia in 1816,  james arnold  the son of benedict arnold  fortified bermuda s royal naval dockyard against possible us today  the national museum of bermuda  which incorporates bermuda s maritime museum  occupies the keep of the royal naval dockyard  including the commissioner s house  and exhibits artifacts of the base s military history as a result of
