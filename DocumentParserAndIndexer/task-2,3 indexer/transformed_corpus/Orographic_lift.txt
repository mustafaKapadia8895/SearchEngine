 orographic lift occurs when an air mass is forced from a low elevation to a higher elevation as it moves over rising terrain  as the air mass gains altitude it quickly cools down adiabatically  which can raise the relative humidity to 100%  and create clouds and  under the right conditions  precipitation precipitation induced by orographic lift occurs in many places throughout the world  examples include the highest precipitation amounts are found slightly upwind from the prevailing winds at the crests of mountain ranges  where they relieve and therefore the upward lifting is greatest  as the air descends the lee side of the mountain  it warms and dries  creating a rain shadow  on the lee side of the mountains  sometimes as little as 15  miles (25  km  away from high precipitation zones  annual precipitation can be as low as 8  inches (200  mm  per where this effect is observed include downslope winds occur on the leeward side of mountain barriers when a stable air mass is carried over the mountain by strong winds that increase in strength with height  moisture is removed and latent heat released as the air mass is orographically lifted  as the air mass descends  it is compression heated  the warm foehn wind  locally known as the chinook wind  bergwind or diablo wind or nor wester depending on the region  provide examples of this type of wind  and are driven in part by latent heat released by orographic-lifting-induced  precipitation a similar class of winds  the sirocco  the bora and santa ana winds  are examples where orographic lifting has limited effect since there is limited moisture to remove in the saharan or other air masses  the sirocco  bora and santa ana are driven primarily by  adiabatic  compression heating as air flows over mountain barriers  orographic lift can create a variety of cloud effects
