 the tropopause is the boundary in the earth s atmosphere between the troposphere and the stratosphere  it is a thermodynamic gradient stratification layer  marking the end of troposphere going upward from the surface  it is the point where air ceases to cool with height  and becomes almost completely dry  more formally  the tropopause is the region of the atmosphere where the environmental lapse rate changes from positive  as it behaves in the troposphere  to the stratospheric negative one  following is the exact definition used by the world meteorological organization the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere  where an abrupt change in lapse rate usually occurs  it is defined as the lowest level at which the lapse rate decreases to 2  °c km or less  provided that the average lapse rate between this level and all higher levels within 2  km does not exceed 2  tropopause as defined above renders as a first-order  discontinuity surface  that is  temperature as a function of height varies continuously through the atmosphere but the temperature gradient does troposphere is one of the lowest layers of the earth s atmosphere  it is located right above the planetary boundary layer  and is the layer in which most weather phenomena take place  the troposphere extends upwards from right above the boundary layer  and ranges in height from an average of 9  km (5.6  mi  30,000  ft  at the poles  to 17  km (11  mi  56,000  ft  at the in the absence of inversions and not considering moisture  the temperature lapse rate for this layer is 6.5  °c per kilometer  on average  according to the u s  standard a measurement of both the tropospheric and the stratospheric lapse rates helps identifying the location of the tropopause  since temperature increases with height in the stratosphere  and hence the lapse rate becomes negative  the tropopause location coincides with the lowest point at which the lapse rate falls below a prescribed threshold since the tropopause responds to the average temperature of the entire layer that lies underneath it  it is at its peak levels over the equator  and reaches minimum heights over the poles  on account of this  the coolest layer in the atmosphere lies at about 17  km over the equator  due to the variation in starting height  the tropopause extremes are referred to as the equatorial tropopause and the polar tropopause given that the lapse rate is not a conservative quantity when the tropopause is considered for stratosphere-troposphere  exchanges studies  there exists an alternative definition named dynamic it is formed with the aid of potential vorticity  which is defined as the product of the isentropic density  i e  the density that arises from using potential temperature as the vertical coordinate  and the absolute vorticity  given that this quantity attains quite different values for the troposphere and the instead of using the vertical temperature gradient as the defining variable  the dynamic tropopause surface is expressed in potential vorticity units 1]  given that the absolute vorticity is positive in the northern hemisphere and negative in the southern hemisphere  the threshold value should be taken as positive north of the equator and negative south of theoretically  to define a global tropopause in this way  the two surfaces arising from the positive and negative thresholds need to be matched near the equator using another type of surface such as a constant potential temperature surface  nevertheless  the dynamic tropopause is useless at equatorial latitudes because the isentropes are almost for the extratropical tropopause in the northern hemisphere the wmo established a value of 1.5  but greater values ranging between 2  and 3.5  pvu have been traditionally is also possible to define the tropopause in terms of chemical for example  the lower stratosphere has much higher ozone concentrations than the upper troposphere  but much lower water vapor concentrations  so appropriate cutoffs can be used the tropopause is not a  hard  boundary  vigorous thunderstorms  for example  particularly those of tropical origin  will overshoot into the lower stratosphere and undergo a brief (hour-order  or less  low-frequency  vertical such oscillation sets up a low-frequency  atmospheric gravity wave capable of affecting both atmospheric and oceanic currents in the needed most commercial aircraft are flown in the lower stratosphere  just above the tropopause  where clouds are usually absent  as also are significant weather
