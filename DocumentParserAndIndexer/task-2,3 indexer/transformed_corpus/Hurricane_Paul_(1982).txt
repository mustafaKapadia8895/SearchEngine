 hurricane paul was a particularly deadly and destructive pacific hurricane which killed a total of 1,696  people and caused $1.156  billion in damage  the sixteenth named storm and tenth hurricane of the 1982  pacific hurricane season  paul developed as a tropical depression just offshore central america on september 18.  the depression briefly moved inland two days later just before heading westward out to sea  the storm changed little in strength for several days until september 25,  when it slowly intensified into a tropical storm  two days later  paul attained hurricane status  and further strengthened to category 2  intensity after turning northward  the hurricane then accelerated toward the northeast  reaching peak winds of 110  mph (175  km h   paul made landfall over baja california sur on september 29,  and subsequently moved ashore in sinaloa  mexico the next day prior to making landfall near the el salvador–guatemala border as a tropical depression  the precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall over nicaragua  which later spread into el salvador and guatemala  many rivers in the region burst their banks after five days of rainfall  causing severe flooding and multiple mudslides  throughout central america  at least 1,432  people were killed  with most of the fatalities occurring in el salvador and guatemala  another 225  deaths were attributed to floods from the depression in southern mexico  in addition  paul was responsible for moderate damage and 24  fatalities in northwestern mexico  where it made landfall at hurricane strength the precursor disturbance to paul originated from an area of low barometric pressure and disorganized thunderstorms  which was first noted near the pacific coast of nicaragua on september 15.  several days later  satellite imagery indicated it had developed a center of cyclonic circulation  on 1800  utc september 20,  the eastern pacific hurricane center initiated advisories on the system and classified it as tropical depression twenty-two.  at that time  it was located 200  mi (320  km  west of managua  nicaragua and supported winds of 35  mph (50  km h   the depression turned northward in response to a weak steering flow between two high pressure systems—one near cabo san lucas and the other west of central america  it then moved inland near the el salvador–guatemala border  and dissipated the influence of a persistent stationary trough near california  the remains of the depression retraced westward back over the open waters of the pacific  advisories on the system were resumed late on september 20.  though it was reconsidered a tropical cyclone  its wind circulation was poorly defined  the depression again degenerated into an open trough at 0000  utc september 22.  its forward motion remained relatively unchanged for several days  and by september 24  the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone  after briefly drifting northward  the system began tracking toward the west-northwest.  it gradually organized into a tropical storm at 0000  utc september 25.  since it was then situated over favorable sea surface temperatures between 28  °c (82  °f  and 29  °c (84  °f   paul underwent a phase of rapid intensification  this allowed it to reach category 1  hurricane strength on the saffir-simpson  hurricane wind scale  sshws  just two days after its becoming a hurricane  paul turned to the north and continued to as the storm neared baja california sur  it reached category 2  an upper-level  trough forced the hurricane to accelerate towards the northeast  at which point it had reached peak wind speeds of 110  mph (180  km h   from 1800  to 2100  utc on september 29,  the eye of the hurricane made landfall along baja california sur  moving ashore less than 100  mi (160  km  south of la paz near san josé del cabo  after weakening slightly inland  paul briefly reemerged over water and subsequently made its final landfall near los mochis  sinaloa with winds of 100  mph (165  tropical cyclone advisories were discontinued shortly though exact information on the storm after it moved inland is unavailable due to a lack of data completion
