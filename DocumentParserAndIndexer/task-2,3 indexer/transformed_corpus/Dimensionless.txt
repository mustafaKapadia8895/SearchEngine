 in dimensional analysis  a dimensionless quantity is a quantity to which no physical dimension is applicable  it is also known as a bare number or a quantity of dimension and the corresponding unit of measurement in the si is one  or 1)  and it is not explicitly shown  dimensionless quantities are widely used in many fields  such as mathematics  physics  engineering  and economics  by contrast  examples of quantities with dimensions are length  time  and speed  which are measured in dimensional units  such as metre  second and metre per second quantities having dimension 1,  habitually called dimensionless quantities  regularly occur in sciences  and are formally treated within the field of dimensional analysis  in the nineteenth century  french mathematician joseph fourier and scottish physicist james clerk maxwell led significant developments in the modern concepts of dimension and unit  later work by british physicists osborne reynolds and lord rayleigh contributed to the understanding of dimensionless numbers in physics  building on rayleigh s method of dimensional analysis  edgar buckingham proved the π theorem  independent of french mathematician joseph bertrand s previous work  to formalize the nature of these quantities  numerous other dimensionless numbers  mostly ratios  were coined in the early 1900s,  particularly in the areas of fluid mechanics and heat transfer  measuring ratios in the  derived  unit db  decibel  finds widespread use nowadays  in the early 2000s,  the international committee for weights and measures discussed naming the unit of 1  as the  uno   but the idea of just introducing a new si-name  for 1  was pure numbers are dimensionless quantities  for example 1,  i  π  e  and units of number such as the dozen  gross  googol  and avogadro s number may also be considered dimensionless dimensionless quantities are often obtained as ratios of quantities that are not dimensionless  but whose dimensions cancel out in the mathematical examples include calculating slopes or unit conversion factors  a more complex example of such a ratio is engineering strain  a measure of physical deformation defined as a change in length divided by the initial length  since both quantities have the dimension length  their ratio is dimensionless  another set of examples is mass fractions or mole fractions often written using parts-per  notation such as ppm    10−6),  ppb    10−9),  and ppt    10−12),  or more confusingly as ratios of two identical units  kg kg or mol mol   for example  alcohol by volume  which characterizes the concentration of ethanol in an alcoholic beverage  could be written as ml   100  ml other common proportions are percentages      0.01),  ‰    0.001)  and angle units such as radians  degrees and grads  in statistics the coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and is used to measure the dispersion in the data the buckingham π theorem indicates that validity of the laws of physics does not depend on a specific unit system  a statement of this theorem is that any physical law can be expressed as an identity involving only dimensionless combinations  ratios or products  of the variables linked by the law  e  g   pressure and volume are linked by boyle s law – they are inversely proportional   if the dimensionless combinations  values changed with the systems of units  then the equation would not be an identity  and buckingham s theorem would not hold another consequence of the theorem is that the functional dependence between a certain number  say  n  of variables can be reduced by the number  say  k  of independent dimensions occurring in those variables to give a set of p   n − k independent  dimensionless quantities  for the purposes of the experimenter  different systems that share the same description by dimensionless quantity are equivalent to demonstrate the application of the π theorem  consider the power consumption of a stirrer with a given shape  the power  p  in dimensions · l2/t3],  is a function of the density  ρ and the viscosity of the fluid to be stirred  μ · t    as well as the size of the stirrer given by its diameter  d and the angular speed of the stirrer  n therefore  we have a total of n   5  variables representing our example  those n   5  variables are built up from k   3  fundamental dimensions  the length  l  si units  m   time  t  s   and mass  m  kg  according to the π-theorem,  the n   5  variables can be reduced by the k   3  dimensions to form p   n − k   5  − 3    2  independent dimensionless numbers  these quantities are r e   ρ n d 2  μ   displaystyle  mathrm  re     frac   rho nd^{2}}{\mu        commonly named the reynolds number which describes the fluid flow regime  and n p   p ρ n 3  d 5    displaystyle n   mathrm  p      frac  p   rho n^{3}d^{5}}}}    the power number  which is the dimensionless description of the stirrer certain fundamental physical constants  such as the speed of light in a vacuum  the universal gravitational constant  planck s constant and boltzmann s constant can be normalized to 1  if appropriate units for time  length  mass  charge  and temperature are chosen  the resulting system of units is known as the natural units  however  not all physical constants can be normalized in this fashion  for example  the values of the following constants are independent of the system of units and must be determined often uses dimensionless quantities to simplify the characterization of systems with multiple interacting physical phenomena  these may be found by applying the buckingham π theorem or otherwise may emerge from making partial differential equations unitless by the process of nondimensionalization  engineering  economics  and other fields often extend these ideas in design and analysis of the relevant systems
