 blombos cave is an archaeological site located in blombosfontein nature reserve  about 300  km east of cape town on the southern cape coastline  south africa  the cave contains middle stone age deposits currently dated at between c  100,000  and 70,000  years before present  bp   and a late stone age sequence dated at between 2000  and 300  years the cave site was first excavated in 1991  and field work has been conducted there on a regular basis since 1997  – and is excavations at blombos cave have yielded important new information on the behavioural evolution of modern humans  the archaeological record from this cave site has been central in the ongoing debate on the cognitive and cultural origin of early humans and to the current understanding of when and where key behavioural innovations emerged among homo sapiens in southern africa during the late archaeological material and faunal remains recovered from the middle stone age phase in blombos cave – dated to ca  100,000–70,000  years bp – are considered to represent greater ecological niche adaptation  a more diverse set of subsistence and procurements strategies  adoption of multi-step  technology and manufacture of composite tools  stylistic elaboration  increased economic and social organisation and occurrence of symbolically mediated behaviour the most informative archaeological material from blombos cave includes engraved engraved ochre processing marine shell refined bone and stone and a broad range of terrestrial and marine faunal remains  including shellfish  birds  tortoise and ostrich egg shell and mammals of various these findings  together with subsequent re-analysis  and excavation of other middle stone age sites in southern africa  have resulted in a paradigm shift with regard to the understanding of the timing and location of the development of modern human behaviour on 29  may 2015  heritage western cape formally protected the site as a provincial heritage cave was first excavated in 1991–1992  as a part of professor christopher s  henshilwood’s (1995)  doctoral at the university of cambridge  holocene archaeology of the coastal garcia state forest  southern cape  south africa  blombos cave was originally one of nine holocene later stone age sites that henshilwood excavated and it was first given the acronym gsf8   garcia state forest  site no  8).  in 1997  gsf8  was renamed blombos cave and given its current acronym  from 1999  to 2011  in total ten field seasons  each six weeks long  have been carried out at the cave site from the initial excavations conducted in the early 1990s,  the blombos cave project has adopted and established new and innovative research agendas in the study of southern african prehistory  while henshilwood’s initial  doctoral research was directed towards the more recent later stone age occupation levels  the focus since 1997  has been on the middle stone age sequence  the blombos cave project has since then developed academically  economically and administratively  from being a local and small-scale  test excavation to becoming an international  full scale  high-technological  archaeological project  in 2010–2015  the cave site is the focus of the multi-disciplinary,  pan-continental  research program tracsymbols the tracsymbols project is led by professor christopher s  henshilwood based at the department of archaeology  history  cultural studies and at the university of bergen and the university of the witwatersrand  south africa  together with professor francesco d’errico from the university of bordeaux 1,  france  the aim of tracsymbols project is to examine how key behavioural innovations emerged among homo sapiens and homo neanderthalensis in southern africa and europe respectively  and to explore whether and how environmental variability influenced this development between 180,000  – 25,000  years ago  primarily by combining archaeological results  original multi‐proxy palaeoenvironmental data and climatic simulations for two continents the cave is situated in a south-facing  cliff face 34.5  meter above sea level  ca  100  meters from the present day shore line  the cave formation is set in calcretes of the wankoe formation  and the geological setting indicates that the cave was formed by wave action sometime during the interior of blombos cave comprises a single main chamber  and the entire  accessible  interior cave floor is about 39m²  behind the drip line  west of the cave s main chamber  anthropogenic deposit extends inwardly 3-5  meter  in this area  however  the cave ceiling lowers to a point where it falls in level with the surface  preventing access to the deposit beneath  in the area north-east  of the main chamber  deposit expands into a low laying ante-chamber  of unknown extent due to the sand filling it  by the end of the 2011  field season about 19.5m²  of interior cave has been dug during the blombos cave excavations blombos cave s outer talus forms a gently sloping platform of about 23m²  that extends 4-5  meter southwards  before the terrain abruptly drops down towards shoreline that lies some 34,5  meters below the cave entrance  the talus  which primarily consists of middle stone age deposit  rock fall and unconsolidated sediments  is stabilised by an area of large  exposed blocks (14m²).  at some stage -  and in between the prehistoric occupation of the cave site -  these blocks have fallen down from the rock face above  effectively preventing site erosion and allowing sediments to stabilize and accumulate in front of the cave s drip line calcium carbonate (caco3)  rich ground water seeps in from the cave roof and percolates through the interior sediments  resulting in an alkaline environment with good preservation conditions  the excavated middle stone age deposit in blombos cave consists of aeolian (wind-borne)  dune sand  blown in through the cave entrance  and roof spall from the cave ceiling  intermixed with these sandy matrixes are decomposed marine and terrestrial faunal remains  fish  shell fish  egg shell and animal bones  and organic material large combustion features  small basin-shaped  hearths and carbonized horizons are recorded throughout the whole msa the excavation started at blombos cave in 1992  the cave entrance was partially sealed by dune sand  and about 20  cm of sterile aeolian deposit covered the interior later stone age deposit  underneath the aeolian sand surface  seven main phases of occupation have been identified in the 2.5-3  meter deep blombos cave stratigraphic sequence  three in the later stone age (l1-l3)  and four in the middle stone age (m1,  upper m2,  lower m2  and m3).  these phases are further divided into finer lenses and sub-lenses,  most of them less than 10  cm thick  the later stone age and middle stone age levels are separated by a 5–50  cm thick  sterile unit named ‘hiatus’ or ‘dun’  the hiatus consists of yellow aeolian sand that blew into the cave at about 68,000-70,000  years bp  and shows little disturbance from the overlying later stone age units humans have briefly and sporadically occupied blombos cave throughout the middle stone age (101,000-70,000  years bp  and in the latter parts of the later stone age (2,000–300  years bp   the occupational hiatus between ca  68,000  and 2,000  years bp  combined with the geological evidence  indicates that the cave site was sealed off by aeolian sand during this period the cave entrance appear to have reopened during the mid-holocene  transgression  c  4,000–3000  years ago   when high sea levels eroded away most of the dune  remnants of this eroded calcarenite dune are still visible in the surrounding coastal landscape the later stone age sequence has been radiocarbon dated to 2000–290  years while the middle stone age sequence is dated to ca  101,000-70,000  years ago through a number of methods  including  thermo-luminescence  optically stimulated luminescence uranium-thorium  series and electron spin resonance the lowest levels of the m3  phase has a preliminary age of >130,000  years ago  while the unexcavated sediments below these levels remains undated  june 2013).the  hiatus level  dun  composed of undisturbed aeolian sand overlying the m1  phase is dated by osl to 69,000  ± 5,000  and 70,000  ± 5000  years bp  while osl ages ranging from 74,900  ± 4,300  to 72,500  ± 4,600  years bp have been obtained for the upper part of the m1  phase  i e  the units associated with the still bay jacobs et al  consider the still bay sequence at blombos cave  with 95%  confidence  to have begun only after 75,500  years bp and ended 67,800  years ago  lasting no longer than 6,600  the true age of the still bay has been debated  and ages presented by jacobs et al  2013  has been challenged on methodological grounds  see next paragraphs   tl ages for the m1  phase are 74,000  ± 5,000  and 78,000  ± 6,000  years lower layers in the m2  phase  layer cg  cgaa  cgab  cgac  have been dated to between 78,900  ± 5,900  and 78,800  ± 5,600  years the upper levels of the m3  phase are dated to ca  100,000  years ago  coinciding with the high sea-level  stand during marine isotope stage  mis  a preliminary age of >130,000  years bp is attributed to the lower m3  phase  the lowest excavated level at the site  critical remarks were in 2013  raised towards the luminescence-based  middle stone age chronology established by jacobs et al  2008  on methodological grounds related to errors in the manipulation of the luminescence data and estimation of uncertainties in the dose rates  the middle stone age chronology for blombos cave derived from optically stimulated luminescence  osl  is  nonetheless  consistent with the ages obtained through alternative methods  tl  esr  u th   and remains uncontested the most extensive and well documented sample of so-called  ‘still bay points’ in southern african comes from the still bay sequence in blombos still bay points are the fossiles directeurs of the still bay techno-complex,  and they conform to bifacially worked stone points  popularly referred to as "lance-heads",   laurel leaf-shaped"  or  willow leaf-shaped"  stone still bay points have bifacially retouched sides  are elliptic to lanceolate shaped and most often they have two pointed apices since the excavation in blombos cave began more than 500  points or point fragments have been recovered  of which 352  have been described in the dominant raw material used for still bay point production in blombos cave is silcrete (72%),  followed by quartzite (15%)  and quartz (13%).  whereas the quartzite and quartz raw material is easily available in close vicinity to the cave  the exact source for silcrete has not been established  it is speculated that it may come from outcrops in riversdale or albertinia – some 30  km away – or from now underwater ca  90%  of the still bay points recovered from blombos cave have been classified as  production rejects   and preliminary analysis of the lithic material from the ‘cc’ unit suggests that the majority of the lithic debitage are by-products  of bifacial point villa et al  (2009:458)  conclude that  blombos was a workshop in the sense that the making of points was a primary – though not exclusive – activity at the manufacture sequence of still bay points has been divided into four main production while hard hammer and direct percussion was used in the initial reduction phase  phase 1),  followed by soft hammer and marginal percussion  phase 2),  pressure flaking was only used during the final retouch phase (3),  and a few points were also reworked by hard hammer percussion  phase 4)     for the moment  the still bay points from blombos cave represent some of the earliest evidence for pressure flaking  a technique more common in considerably more recent lithic experimental replication by mourre et al  2010  and microscopic study of still bay points from blombos cave indicates that some silcrete blanks were deliberately heat-treated,  before pressure flaking was employed in the final reduction sequence  and thus improving the silcrete’s flaking has been argued that the bifacial points were hafted and used primarily as spear or knives or both some researchers have suggested that the seeming concern for the appearance of the finished point may represent evidence for social and stylistic elaboration during the still bay points may have served as tools with symbolic values attached to them – perhaps used as markers of identity – and integrated in social exchange similar to the ones observed högberg and larsson 2011  hypothesise that blanks and unfinished still bay points were purposely left behind in hollow rock shelter  perhaps for being used at a later stage or as an act of solidarity with other hunter-gatherer  – an iron-rich  mineral – is regularly found at stone age sites throughout southern africa  and has also been recovered from the middle stone age levels in blombos more than 8,000  pieces of ochre-like  material  of which more than 1500  are ≥10mm  in length  have been recovered from the middle stone age levels of blombos cave  many of them show use-wear  traces from intentional use and processing some of these recovered ochre pieces have been deliberately engraved or incised and it is argued that they represent a kind of early abstract or symbolic depiction and is arguably among the most complex and clearly formed of objects claimed to be early abstract 2002  the recovery of two finely engraved ochre pieces – both deriving from the still bay units (m1  phase  – was reported in science the surfaces of both pieces were intentionally modified by scraping and grinding  and the engraved pattern formed a distinct cross-hatched  design in combination with parallel incised lines  in 2009,  six additional pieces of engraved ochre – this time recovered from entire middle stone age sequence dated to between 70,000  and 100,000  years old – were comparable geometric designs have also been observed on an engraved bone fragment from blombos cave m1  phase engraved ochre has also been reported from other middle stone age sites  such as klein wonderwerk and klasies river cave arguably  these engraved pieces of ochre represent – together with the engraved ostrich egg shells from – the earliest forms of abstract representation and conventional design tradition hitherto recorded geometric or iconographic representations have traditionally been archaeological categories associated with modern human behaviour and cognitive complexity evidence for abstract representations is well documented in europe after 40,000  years ago  and for a long time it was therefore thought that the earliest form of art originated the evidence from blombos cave – and from sites like klasies river  diepkloof rock shelter  klein kliphuis and wonderwerk cave – implies that abstract representations were made in southern africa at least 30,000  years earlier than in europe and that stylistic elaboration and symbolic traditions were common in southern africa 70,000–100,000  years the incised ochre pieces recovered from blombos cave and various other middle stone age sites indicates that there was a spatial and temporal continuity in the production and use of conventional symbols in the region yet  recent studies also demonstrate that the mere occurrence of ochre in msa contexts cannot be limited to a symbolic interpretation alone  but its use may also have served some functional role  e g  as an ingredient in mastic  skin protection against sun or insects  as soft-hammers  for delicate knapping  as a hide preservative or as 2008  an ochre processing workshop consisting of two toolkits was uncovered in the 100,000-year-old  levels at blombos cave  south analysis shows that a liquefied pigment-rich  mixture was produced and stored in the shells of two haliotis midae  abalone   and that ochre  bone  charcoal  grindstones and hammer-stones  also formed a composite part of the toolkits  as both toolkits were left in situ  and as there are few other archaeological remains in the same layer  it seems the site was used primarily as a workshop and was abandoned shortly after the pigment-rich  compounds were made  dune sand then blew into the cave from the outside  encapsulated the toolkits and by happenstance ensured their preservation before the next occupants arrived  possibly several decades or centuries later the application or use of the compound is not self-evident.  no resins or wax were detected that might indicate it was an adhesive for hafting  possible uses could include painting a surface in order to decorate or protect it  or to create a design  the recovery of these toolkits at blombos cave nevertheless adds evidence for early technological and behavioural developments associated with middle stone age humans  it documents the first known instance for the deliberate planning  production and curation of a pigmented compound and for the use of a container  evidence for the complexity of the task includes procuring and combining raw materials from various sources  implying they had a mental template of the process they would follow   possibly using pyrotechnology to facilitate fat extraction from bone  using a probable recipe to produce the compound  and the use of shell containers for mixing and storage for later use  an elementary knowledge of chemistry and the ability for long-term  planning suggests conceptual and cognitive abilities previously unknown for this time and serves as a benchmark during the early evolution of the technological and cognitive abilities of homo sapiens in southern africa formal bone tools are relatively rare artefacts to find at msa at blombos cave several bone tools  including awls and bone points  have been recovered from both the later stone age and middle stone age sequence  more than thirty bone tools  e g  awls and polished bone points  have been attributed to the still bay the awls that have been recovered are primarily made on long-bone  shaft fragments  are shaped by scraping and may have been used to pierce through soft material -  such as leather – or shell some of the bone points  which may have been used as projectile points and hafted  were besides being scraped also carefully polished in the final production phase of the tool  it has been questioned whether the polish have improved the bone tools’ functionality  and it has been hypothesized the polish might represent a technique applied deliberately to primarily enhance the bone points’ aesthetic quality and to give them ‘added the polished bone points may have formed part of a material culture exchange system amongst groups to maintain or even enhance social relations  perhaps similar to the stone point exchange systems observed the behavioural and evolutionary significance of prehistoric bone shaping is  however  not entirely clear and has been – and still is – critically examined and discussed by addition to conventional bone tools  a modified bone fragment marked with eight parallel lines has also been recovered from the still bay the bone incisions do not look like ordinary butchery marks  microscopic analysis shows that the incisions most likely represent a deliberately engraved pattern made with a stone tool  and it may be comparable with the geometric design observed on the engraved pieces of ochre more than 70  marine shell beads of the sea snail species nassarius kraussianus have been found in the m1  and upper m2  phases at blombos the beads are exclusively confined to the still bay occupation units  and the majority have been found in the m1  phase  it has been argued that the marine shells were deliberately pierced through the aperture  probably with a bone tool  thus creating of a small-sized  contextual information  morphometric  technological and use-wear  analysis of the blombos cave beads  alongside experimental reproduction of wear patterns  show that the nassarius kraussianus shells were strung  perhaps on cord or sinew and worn as a personal ornament  a cluster of 24  perforated nassarius kraussianus has been recovered from one of the still bay units and strengthens this interpretation  as it appears that these shells originated from a single beadwork  beside the deliberate perforation of the nassarius shells  repeated rubbing of the beads against one another and against the cord  have resulted in discrete use wear facets on each bead that are not observed on these shells in their natural environment  these use-wear  patterns are the principal factor that defines the shells as beads  also  the consistency in shell size and colour indicates that the nassarius shells were carefully selected  ochre has been detected inside some of the shell beads  implicating that they were subject to deliberate or indirect use of ochre as a colouring agent the wearing and display of personal ornaments during the still bay phase was not idiosyncratic  in-depth  analyses of the blombos cave shell beads deriving from various levels and squares within the site demonstrate chronological regularities and variability  in terms of manufacture  stringing method and design of the bead discrete groups of beads with wear patterns and colouring specific to that group have been recovered  a patterning that suggests that at least a number of individuals may have worn beads  perhaps on their person or attached to clothing or other artifacts  thus  the blombos cave beads may document one of the first examples where changes in complex social conventions directly can be traced through distinct variations in the production and use of symbolic material culture over time the shell beads also provide insights into technological and behavioral aspects of the humans living in the still bay phase  including the ability to drill  the use of cord or gut for threading and the probable tying of knots to secure the beads  a comprehension of self-awareness  or self-recognition  is implied by the wearing of beads or other personal ornaments and was likely an important factor in cognitive evolution that was selected for long before the introduction of beads  further  syntactical language would have been essential for the sharing and transmission of the symbolic meaning of personal ornaments within and between groups and also over generations  as is also suggested for the engraved ochre pieces until recently  the first use of personal ornaments was thought to occur with the arrival of homo sapiens in europe  some 40,000  years most academics now believes that marine shells were used as beads in the near east  north africa  and sub-saharan  africa at least 30,000  years earlier than their first use in europe  besides blombos cave  there are a number of african and middle east sites that all have yielded strong evidence for the early use of personal ornaments  skul and qafzeh  oued djebbana  grotte des pigeons  rhafas  ifri n ammar and contrebandiers  skeletal remains have been found in blombos cave and the amount of other types of recovered human material from the middle stone age units amounts only to seven the crown diameters of at least some of these teeth are morphometric  modern  in terms of tooth size reduction  implying that the humans occupying blombos cave were anatomically modern  this conclusion is supported by similar evidence from a nearby archaeological site  klasies river  that dates to a similar time blombos cave a great variety of terrestrial and marine faunal remains are consistently found throughout the later stone age and middle stone age the faunal record from blombos cave shows that middle stone age people practiced a subsistence strategy that included a very broad range of animals  this means they were able to hunt large animals  such as eland  but also gathered  collected or trapped small animals such as tortoises  hyraxes and dune mole rats  they also brought seal  dolphin and probably whale meat back to the cave  the latter two were almost certainly scavenged from beach wash-ups,  but seals may have been speared or clubbed the faunal remains recovered include specifically  shellfish  birds  tortoise and ostrich egg shell and mammals of various the amount of shell fish recovered from the various middle stone age units show that people were regularly collecting them at the shore and bringing them back to the cave for consumption  common species include the giant periwinkle  turbo sarmaticus   limpets  patella spp   and brown mussels  perna perna  species variations may  with larger sample sizes  inform us of past changes in ocean palaeo-temperatures.  in terms of kilograms of shell fish per cubic meter  kg m³   still bay is the middle stone age phase in blombos cave where shellfish are found in least abundance (17.5  kg m³   and they seem to have been more intensively exploited in the earlier occupation phases  the changes observed in shellfish procurement through the various msa phases may relate to fluctuating climatic conditions and changing sea levels  which have altered the cave’s proximity to the coastline and affected the sea level remains are present  but not abundant  in all phases at blombos fish are more abundant in the later stone age but a wider range of species are present in the middle stone age sequence  chemical analysis of fish bone from the later stone age and middle stone age levels  using the carbon nitrogen method  confirms the antiquity of the middle stone age specimens  most of the species present are not known to wash up after cold water upwelling events  hence scavenging of wash-ups  was not the primary source of fish  no artefacts that appear to be obvious fishing equipment have been found  but the range and sizes of species present indicate that a number of methods must have been employed  these may have included  baited hooks  spearing and tidal traps where the same fish species have survived in both later stone age and middle stone age levels  analysis of relative bone element occurrence show a significant deficit in the middle stone age  in other words  age-related  taphonomic processes have resulted in the loss of many fish bones  and it is likely that more fish were originally deposited in the middle stone age levels than have been recovered through archaeological excavations  fish are seldom reported from other southern african msa sites  and by implication  it was thought that middle stone age people were incapable of exploiting coastal resources efficiently  the evidence for fishing at blombos cave and klasies river contradicts this huge variety of faunal and the shell fish remains recovered from all parts of the blombos cave middle stone age sequence demonstrate that people during this period practiced a diverse set of subsistence and procurements strategies and were able to effectively hunt  trap and collect coastal  as well as terrestrial  resources  the subsistence behaviour inferred from the faunal assemblages can hardly be distinguished from the remains and behaviour seen in more recent later stone age contexts thus  the overall subsistence pattern at blombos cave signifies that no clear distinction can be made between later stone age and middle stone age subsistence behaviour at the of past environmental change are typically defined by marine oxygen isotope stages  mis  that are derived from oxygen isotope signals in planktonic foraminifera found in marine cores  the climatic fluctuations documented from mis 6  through to mis 3  spans the duration of the southern african msa  these stages are therefore most pertinent  in the archaeological context  environmental proxies typically come from a broad range of sources such as microfauna  macrofauna  fossil pollen  dune sediments and speleothems  in recent years  there has been a growing interest in improving our understanding of the environments in which msa peoples lived and interacted with each other this is because aspects of msa behaviours related to artefact production  subsistence  pigment use and migration patterns are increasingly being linked to periods of climatic  and by extension environmental change a link  if any  between msa lifeways and the environmental context in which msa behaviours developed is while some researchers argue for links between extreme climate change and social change there is some the differing views regarding the role of past environmental change on middle stone age people is also complicated by the wide range of climate proxies which can be interpreted at varying spatial and temporal the aim of current research efforts focusing on msa environments is therefore two-fold.  firstly  improving the temporal resolution of proxies by applying suitable dating methods such as radiocarbon  uranium-series,  luminescence  etc  secondly and most importantly  is to refine the available proxy database so that ambiguous and often  conflicting interpretations can be re-assessed  as new information emerges  in light of this  two key studies have emerged  jacobs and who evaluate and synthesise the dates for the still bay and howiesons poort periods across southern africa and who addresses the issues about mis 4  environments and the role of climate forcing during this period  a current synthesis of environmental proxy evidence associated with mis 4  indicates that the still bay and howiesons poort occurred during relatively humid it is however not clear what environmental conditions during earlier periods of the msa  i e  msa i  ii  iii   msa 2)  were like  these early msa periods are broadly correlated with mis 6  and mis 5   b  c  d  e  but have not been investigated in any detail blombos cave was declared a provincial heritage site by heritage western cape on the 29  may 2015  in terms of section 27  of the national heritage resources this gives the site grade ii status and provides it with protection under south african heritage law also in 2015,  the south african government submitted a proposal to add the cave to the list of world heritage sites and it has been placed on the unesco list of tentative sites as a potential future  serial nomination  together with pinnacle point  sibudu cave  klasies river caves  border cave and diepkloof rock
