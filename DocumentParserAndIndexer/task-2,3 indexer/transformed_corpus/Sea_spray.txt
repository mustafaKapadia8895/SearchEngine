 sea spray refers to aerosol particles that are formed directly from the ocean  mostly by ejection into the atmosphere by bursting bubbles at the air-sea  salt aerosol  ssa  contains both inorganic salts and organic matter from the it is thought that the amount of organic matter transferred to ssa depends on microbiological the organic matter in sea spray can contain dissolved organic or even microbes themselves  like bacteria and spray is largely responsible for corrosion of metallic objects near the coastline  as the salts accelerate the corrosion process in the presence of abundant atmospheric oxygen and moisture  salts do not dissolve in air directly  but are suspended as fine particulates  or dissolved in microscopic airborne water droplets the salt spray test is the notable measure of material endurance  particularly if the material will be used outdoors and must perform in a mechanical load bearing or otherwise critical role  these results are often of great interest to the marine industries  whose products may suffer extreme acceleration of corrosion and subsequent failure due to the salt water environment
