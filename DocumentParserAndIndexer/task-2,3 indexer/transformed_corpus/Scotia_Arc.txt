 the scotia arc is the island arc system forming the north  east and south border of the scotia sea  the northern border  the north scotia ridge  comprises  from west to east  isla de los estados at the tip of tierra del fuego  the burdwood  davis  and aurora banks  the shag  south georgia island and clerke rocks  the eastern border comprises the volcanic south sandwich islands flanked by the south sandwich trench  the southern border  the south scotia ridge   east to west  comprises herdman  discovery  bruce  pirie  and jane banks  the south orkney islands and elephant island  the bransfield strait  finally  separates the arc from the south shetland islands and james ross island flanking the tip of the antarctic scotia arc surrounds the small scotia and south sandwich the arc is formed by continental fragments that once formed a land bridge between south america and antarctica  once part of the subduction margin that still forms the andes  an ancestral arc  which formed a separate subduction system  broke through this land bridge and started to form the scotia sea by eastward back-arc  extension driven by subduction of the south american plate  also located east of the scotia today  the scotia arc forms a discontinuous link between south america and antarctica and an important barrier between the pacific and atlantic oceans  and therefore for the antarctic circumpolar formation of the scotia arc was initiated by an acceleration in south america s westward migration in the mid-cretaceous  (120  to 83  million years ago  ma  which led to the uplift of the fuegan andes and the then adjacent and embryonic north scotia ridge  the uplift of the ridge initiated the eastward migration of the south georgia microcontinent from tierra del fuego towards its current location  in the late cretaceous south america started to move west relative to changed in the region between the late cretaceous and oligocene (90-30  ma  except for the subduction of the phoenix plate on the pacific margin of the land bridge that still connected south america and antarctica — what would become the drake passage was at this time a cusp on the pacific side of the land late paleocene to the early eocene (55  ma  saw rift basin formation in the fuegan andes which led to crustal extension  the first sign of separation between the two continents and the formation of the south scotia sea and south scotia ridge  spreading in the west scotia sea led to the further lengthening of the north scotia ridge and south georgia moving further east  spreading in the west scotia sea finally led to the rifting of the south orkney microcontinent from the tip of the antarctic peninsula  this event initiated the south scotia banks of the south scotia ridge are made of continental crust that rifted off the land bridge 40-30  ma  the banks on the northern central scotia sea  on the other hand  are volcanic constructs overlaying an oceanic basement parts of which is the spreading centre of the separation between south america and spreading in the west scotia sea continued until 6.6-5.9  ma  the oldest volcanic activity in central and eastern scotia sea  i e  the first signs of a volcanic arc  has been dated to 28.5  ma  the south sandwich islands fore-arc  originated in the central scotia sea and was translated eastward by the back-arc  spreading centre in the east scotia sea  i e  the east scotia ridge  south georgia s eastward migration ended about 9  ma when the microcontinent collided with the northeast georgia rise large igneous province on the south american plate north-east  of south georgia  a submerged equivalent to the current south sandwich arc was relocated westward by the same spreading centre  after  and probably because of  the collision  the east scotia sea spreading centre split the ancestral south sandwich arc leaving a remnant arc under the central scotia sea  the collision also produced the rugged allardyce range on south georgia  making the 3,000  m (9,800  ft)-high  range three times higher than the conjugate rocks on navarino island in tierra del driving mechanism behind the formation of the arc  as proposed by alvarez is a mantle return-flow  from the pacific to the 57°30′s  40°00′w﻿    ﻿57.500°s  40.000°w﻿    -57.500;  -40.000
