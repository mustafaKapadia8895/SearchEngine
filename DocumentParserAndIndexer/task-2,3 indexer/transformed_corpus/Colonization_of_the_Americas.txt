 the european colonization of the americas describes the history of the settlement and establishment of control of the continents of the americas by various european powers  starting in either the 10th  or 11th  century  when west norse sailors explored and briefly settled on the shores of present-day  canada  according to icelandic sagas  violent conflicts with the indigenous population ultimately led to the norse abandoning those colonization began in 1492,  when a spanish expedition headed by the genoese explorer christopher columbus sailed west to find a new trade route to the far east but inadvertently landed in what came to be known to europeans as the  new world   running aground on the northern part of hispaniola on 5  december 1492,  which the taino people had inhabited since the 7th  century  the site became the first european settlement in the americas  european conquest  large-scale  exploration and colonization soon followed  columbus s first two voyages (1492–93)  reached the bahamas and various caribbean islands  including hispaniola  puerto rico and cuba  in 1498,  sailing from bristol on behalf of england  john cabot landed on the north american coast  and a year later  columbus s third voyage reached the south american coast  as the sponsor of christopher columbus s voyages  spain was the first european power to settle and colonize the largest areas  from north america and the caribbean to the southern tip of south america other powers such as france also founded colonies in the americas  in eastern north america  a number of caribbean islands and small coastal parts of south america  portugal colonized brazil  tried colonizing the eastern coasts of present-day  canada and settled for extended periods northwest  on the east bank  of the river plate  the age of exploration was the beginning of territorial expansion for several european countries  europe had been preoccupied with internal wars and was slowly recovering from the loss of population caused by the black death  thus the rapid rate at which it grew in wealth and power was unforeseeable in the early 15th  most of the western hemisphere came under the control of european governments  leading to changes to its landscape  population  and plant and animal life  in the 19th  century over 50  million people left europe for the the post-1492  era is known as the period of the columbian exchange  a dramatically widespread exchange of animals  plants  culture  human populations  including slaves   ideas and communicable disease between the american and afro-eurasian  hemispheres following columbus s voyages to the americas norse journeys to greenland and canada are supported by historical and archaeological a norse colony in greenland was established in the late 10th  century  and lasted until the mid 15th  century  with court and parliament assemblies  þing  taking place at brattahlíð and a bishop located at the remains of a norse settlement at l anse aux meadows in newfoundland  canada  were discovered in 1960  and were dated to around the year 1000   carbon dating estimate 990–1050  l anse aux meadows is the only site widely accepted as evidence of pre-columbian  trans-oceanic  contact  it was named a world heritage site by unesco in it is also notable for its possible connection with the attempted colony of vinland  established by leif erikson around the same period or  more broadly  with the west norse colonization of the explorations and conquests were made by the spanish and the portuguese immediately following their own final reconquest of iberia in 1492.  in the 1494  treaty of tordesillas  ratified by the pope  these two kingdoms divided the entire non-european  world into two areas of exploration and colonization  with a north to south boundary that cut through the atlantic ocean and the eastern part of present-day  brazil  based on this treaty and on early claims by spanish explorer vasco núñez de balboa  discoverer of the pacific ocean in 1513,  the spanish conquered large territories in north  central and south america spanish conquistador hernán cortés took over the aztec kingdom and francisco pizarro conquered the inca empire  as a result  by the mid-16th  century  the spanish crown had gained control of much of western south america  central america and southern north america  in addition to its earlier caribbean territories  over this same timeframe  portugal claimed lands in north america  canada  and colonized much of eastern south america  naming it santa cruz and brazil other european nations soon disputed the terms of the treaty of tordesillas  england and france attempted to plant colonies in the americas in the 16th  century  but these failed  england and france succeeded in establishing permanent colonies in the following century  along with the dutch republic  some of these were on caribbean islands  which had often already been conquered by the spanish or depopulated by disease  while others were in eastern north america  which had not been colonized by spain north of florida early european possessions in north america included spanish florida  spanish new mexico  the english colonies of virginia  with its north atlantic offshoot  bermuda  and new england  the french colonies of acadia and canada  the swedish colony of new sweden  and the dutch new netherland  in the 18th  century  denmark–norway revived its former colonies in greenland  while the russian empire gained a foothold in alaska  denmark-norway  would later make several claims in the caribbean  starting in the 1600s.as  more nations gained an interest in the colonization of the americas  competition for territory became increasingly fierce  colonists often faced the threat of attacks from neighboring colonies  as well as from indigenous tribes and pirates the first phase of well-financed  european activity in the americas began with the atlantic ocean crossings of christopher columbus (1492–1504),  sponsored by spain  whose original attempt was to find a new route to india and china  known as  the indies   he was followed by other explorers such as john cabot  who was sponsored by england and reached newfoundland  pedro álvares cabral reached brazil and claimed it for portugal amerigo vespucci  working for portugal in voyages from 1497  to 1513,  established that columbus had reached a new set of continents  cartographers still use a latinized version of his first name  america  for the two continents  other explorers included giovanni da verrazzano  sponsored by france in 1524;  the portuguese joão vaz corte-real  in newfoundland  joão fernandes lavrador  gaspar and miguel corte-real  and joão álvares fagundes  in newfoundland  greenland  labrador  and nova scotia  from 1498  to 1502,  and in 1520);  jacques cartier (1491–1557),  henry hudson (1560s–1611),  and samuel de champlain (1567–1635),  who explored the region of canada he reestablished as new france in 1513,  vasco núñez de balboa crossed the isthmus of panama and led the first european expedition to see the pacific ocean from the west coast of the new world  in an action with enduring historical import  balboa claimed the pacific ocean and all the lands adjoining it for the spanish crown  it was 1517  before another expedition  from cuba  visited central america  landing on the coast of yucatán in search of slaves these explorations were followed  notably in the case of spain  by a phase of conquest  the spaniards  having just finished the reconquista of spain from muslim rule  were the first to colonize the americas  applying the same model of governing their european holdings to their territories of the new world ten years after columbus s discovery  the administration of hispaniola was given to nicolás de ovando of the order of alcántara  founded during the reconquista  as in the iberian peninsula  the inhabitants of hispaniola were given new landmasters  while religious orders handled the local administration  progressively the encomienda system  which granted tribute  access to indigenous labor and taxation  to european settlers  was set in place a relatively common misconception is that a small number of conquistadores conquered vast territories  aided only by disease epidemics and their powerful caballeros  in fact  recent archaeological excavations have suggested a vast spanish-indian  alliance numbering in the hundreds of hernán cortés eventually conquered mexico with the help of tlaxcala in 1519–1521,  while the conquest of the incas was carried out by some 40,000  incan renegades led by francisco pizarro in between 1532  and 1535.over  the 1st  century and a half after columbus s voyages  the native population of the americas plummeted by an estimated 80%   from around 50  million in 1492  to eight million in mostly by outbreaks of old world diseases in 1532,  charles v  holy roman emperor sent a vice-king  to mexico  antonio de mendoza  in order to prevent cortes  independentist drives  who definitively returned to spain in 1540.  two years later  charles v signed the new laws  which replaced the laws of burgos of 1512)  prohibiting slavery and the repartimientos  but also claiming as his own all the american lands and all of the indigenous people as his own subjects when in may 1493,  the pope alexander vi issued the inter caetera bull granting the new lands to the kingdom of spain  he requested in exchange an evangelization of the people  thus  during columbus s second voyage  benedictine friars accompanied him  along with twelve other priests  as slavery was prohibited between christians  and could only be imposed in non-christian  prisoners of war or on men already sold as slaves  the debate on christianization was particularly acute during the 16th  century  in 1537,  the papal bull sublimis deus definitively recognized that native americans possessed souls  thus prohibiting their enslavement  without putting an end to the debate  some claimed that a native who had rebelled and then been captured could be enslaved nonetheless later  the valladolid debate between the dominican priest bartolomé de las casas and another dominican philosopher juan ginés de sepúlveda was held  with the former arguing that native americans were beings doted with souls  as all other human beings  while the latter argued to the contrary and justified their enslavement the process of christianization was at first violent  when the first franciscans arrived in mexico in 1524,  they burned the places dedicated to pagan cult  alienating much of the local in the 1530s,  they began to adapt christian practices to local customs  including the building of new churches on the sites of ancient places of worship  leading to a mix of old world christianity with local the spanish roman catholic church  needing the natives  labor and cooperation  evangelized in quechua  nahuatl  guaraní and other native american languages  contributing to the expansion of these indigenous languages and equipping some of them with writing systems  one of the first primitive schools for native americans was founded by fray pedro de gante in 1523.to  reward their troops  the conquistadores often allotted indian towns to their troops and officers  black african slaves were introduced to substitute for native american labor in some locations—including the west indies  where the indigenous population was nearing extinction on many islands during this time  the portuguese gradually switched from an initial plan of establishing trading posts to extensive colonization of what is now brazil  they imported millions of slaves to run their plantations  the portuguese and spanish royal governments expected to rule these settlements and collect at least 20%  of all treasure found  the quinto real collected by the casa de contratación   in addition to collecting all the taxes they could  by the late 16th  century american silver accounted for one-fifth  of spain s total in the 16th  century perhaps 240,000  europeans entered american by the spanish riches from colonies founded upon the conquest of the aztecs  incas  and other large native american populations in the 16th  century  the first englishmen to settle permanently in america hoped for some of the same rich discoveries when they established their first permanent settlement in jamestown  virginia in 1607.  they were sponsored by common stock companies such as the chartered virginia company financed by wealthy englishmen who exaggerated the economic potential of this new land  the main purpose of this colony was the hope of finding took strong leaders  like john smith  to convince the colonists of jamestown that searching for gold was not taking care of their immediate needs for food and shelter and the biblical principle that  he who will not work shall not eat   see 2  thessalonians 3).  the lack of food security leading to extremely high mortality rate was quite distressing and cause for despair among the colonists  to support the colony  numerous supply missions were organized  tobacco later became a cash crop  with the work of john rolfe and others  for export and the sustaining economic driver of virginia and the neighboring colony of maryland from the beginning of virginia s settlements in 1587  until the 1680s,  the main source of labor and a large portion of the immigrants were indentured servants looking for new life in the overseas colonies  during the 17th  century  indentured servants constituted three-quarters  of all european immigrants to the chesapeake region  most of the indentured servants were teenagers from england with poor economic prospects at home  their fathers signed the papers that gave them free passage to america and an unpaid job until they became of age  they were given food  clothing  housing and taught farming or household skills  american landowners were in need of laborers and were willing to pay for a laborer’s passage to america if they served them for several years  by selling passage for five to seven years worth of work they could then start out on their own in many of the migrants from england died in the first few advantage also prompted the darien scheme  an ill-fated  venture by the kingdom of scotland to settle the isthmus of panama in the late 1690s.  the darien scheme aimed to control trade through that part of the world and thereby promote scotland into a world trading power  however  it was doomed by poor planning  short provisions  weak leadership  lack of demand for trade goods  and devastating the failure of the darien scheme was one of the factors that led the kingdom of scotland into the act of union 1707  with the kingdom of england creating the united kingdom of great britain and giving scotland commercial access to english  now british  the french colonial regions  the focus of economy was on sugar plantations in caribbean  in canada the fur trade with the natives was important  about 16,000  french men and women became colonizers  the great majority became subsistence farmers along the st  lawrence river  with a favorable disease environment and plenty of land and food  their numbers grew exponentially to 65,000  by 1760.  their colony was taken over by britain in 1760,  but social  religious  legal  cultural and economic changes were few in a society that clung tightly to its recently formed catholics were the first major religious group to immigrate to the new world  as settlers in the colonies of portugal and spain  and later  france  belonged to that faith  english and dutch colonies  on the other hand  tended to be more religiously diverse  settlers to these colonies included anglicans  dutch calvinists  english puritans and other nonconformists  english catholics  scottish presbyterians  french huguenots  german and swedish lutherans  as well as quakers  mennonites  amish  moravians and jews of various nationalities many groups of colonists went to the americas searching for the right to practice their religion without persecution  the protestant reformation of the 16th  century broke the unity of western christendom and led to the formation of numerous new religious sects  which often faced persecution by governmental authorities  in england  many people came to question the organization of the church of england by the end of the 16th  century  one of the primary manifestations of this was the puritan movement  which sought to  purify  the existing church of england of its many residual catholic rites that they believed had no mention in the bible a strong believer in the notion of rule by divine right  charles i  king of england and scotland  persecuted religious dissenters  waves of repression led to the migration of about 20,000  puritans to new england between 1629  and 1642,  where they founded multiple colonies  later in the century  the new pennsylvania colony was given to william penn in settlement of a debt the king owed his father  its government was set up by william penn in about 1682  to become primarily a refuge for persecuted english quakers  but others were welcomed  baptists  quakers  german and swiss protestants and anabaptists flocked to pennsylvania  the lure of cheap land  religious freedom and the right to improve themselves with their own hand was very was a common practice in the americas prior to the arrival of europeans  as different american indian groups captured and held other tribes  members as many of these captives were forced to undergo human sacrifice in amerindian civilizations such as the aztecs  in response to some enslavement of natives in the caribbean during the early years  the spanish crown passed a series of laws prohibiting slavery as early as 1512.  a new stricter set of laws was passed in 1542,  called the new laws of the indies for the good treatment and preservation of indians  or simply new laws  these were created to prevent the exploitation of the indigenous peoples by the encomenderos or landowners  by strictly limiting their power and this helped curb indian slavery considerably  though not completely  later  with the arrival of other european colonial powers in the new world  the enslavement of native populations increased  as these empires lacked legislation against slavery until decades later  the population of indigenous peoples declined  mostly from european diseases  but also from forced exploitation and atrocities   later  native workers were replaced by africans imported through a large commercial slave trade by the 18th  century  the overwhelming number of black slaves was such that amerindian slavery was less commonly used  africans  who were taken aboard slave ships to the americas  were primarily obtained from their african homelands by coastal tribes who captured and sold them  europeans traded for slaves with the slave capturers of the local native african tribes in exchange for rum  guns  gunpowder  and other manufactures the total slave trade to islands in the caribbean  brazil  mexico and to the united states is estimated to have involved 12  million the vast majority of these slaves went to sugar colonies in the caribbean and to brazil  where life expectancy was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished  at most about 600,000  african slaves were imported into the u s   or 5%  of the 12  million slaves brought across from life expectancy was much higher in the u s   because of better food  less disease  lighter work loads  and better medical care  so the numbers grew rapidly by excesses of births over deaths  reaching 4  million by the 1860  census  from 1770  until 1860,  the rate of natural growth of north american slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in europe  and was nearly twice as rapid as that of imported to the thirteen colonies united states by time european lifestyle included a long history of sharing close quarters with domesticated animals such as cows  pigs  sheep  goats  horses  dogs and various domesticated fowl  from which many diseases originally stemmed  thus  in contrast to the indigenous people  europeans had developed a richer endowment of the large-scale  contact with europeans after 1492  introduced novel germs to the indigenous people of the americas epidemics of smallpox (1518,  1521,  1525,  1558,  1589),  typhus (1546),  influenza (1558),  diphtheria (1614)  and measles (1618)  swept the americas subsequent to european killing between 10  million and 100  people  up to 95%  of the indigenous population of the the cultural and political instability attending these losses appears to have been of substantial aid in the efforts of various colonists in new england and massachusetts to acquire control over the great wealth in land and resources of which indigenous societies had customarily made diseases yielded human mortality of an unquestionably enormous gravity and scale – and this has profoundly confused efforts to determine its full extent with any true precision  estimates of the pre-columbian  population of the americas vary tremendously others have argued that significant variations in population size over pre-columbian  history are reason to view higher-end  estimates with caution  such estimates may reflect historical population maxima  while indigenous populations may have been at a level somewhat below these maxima or in a moment of decline in the period just prior to contact with europeans  indigenous populations hit their ultimate lows in most areas of the americas in the early 20th  century  in a number of cases  growth has differences between the colonies played a large determinant in the types of political and economic systems that later developed  in their paper on institutions and long-run  growth  economists daron acemoğlu  simon johnson  and james a  robinson argue that certain natural endowments gave rise to distinct colonial policies promoting either smallholder or coerced labor densely settled populations  for example  were more easily exploitable and profitable as slave labor  in these regions  landowning elites were economically incentivized to develop forced labor arrangements such as the peru mit a system or argentinian latifundias without regard for democratic norms  french and british colonial leaders  conversely  were incentivized to develop capitalist markets  property rights  and democratic institutions in response to natural environments that supported smallholder production over forced labor james mahoney  a professor at northwestern university  proposes that colonial policy choices made at critical junctures regarding land ownership in coffee-rich  central america fostered enduring path dependent coffee economies in guatemala and el salvador  for example  were centralized around large plantations that operated under coercive labor systems  by the 19th  century  their political structures were largely authoritarian and militarized  in colombia and costa rica  conversely  liberal reforms were enacted at critical junctures to expand commercial agriculture  and they ultimately raised the bargaining power of the middle class  both nations eventually developed more democratic and egalitarian institutions than their highly concentrated landowning counterparts in 2007,  the smithsonian institution national museum of american history and the virginia historical society  vhs  co-organized  a traveling exhibition to recount the strategic alliances and violent conflict between european empires  english  spanish  french  and the native people living in north america  the exhibition was presented in three languages and with multiple perspectives  artifacts on display included rare surviving native and european artifacts  maps  documents  and ceremonial objects from museums and royal collections on both sides of the atlantic  the exhibition opened in richmond  virginia on march 17,  2007,  and closed at the smithsonian international gallery on october 31,  2009.the  related online exhibition explores the international origins of the societies of canada and the united states and commemorates the 400th  anniversary of three lasting settlements in jamestown (1607),  québec (1608),  and santa fe (1609).  the site is accessible in three
