 aristotle greek  ἀριστοτέλης  pronounced aristotélēs  384–322  was an ancient greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of stagira  chalkidice  on the northern periphery of classical greece  his father  nicomachus  died when aristotle was a child  whereafter proxenus of atarneus became his at seventeen or eighteen years of age  he joined plato s academy in and remained there until the age of thirty-seven   c  347  bc   his writings cover many subjects – including physics  biology  zoology  metaphysics  logic  ethics  aesthetics  poetry  theater  music  rhetoric  linguistics  politics and government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of western philosophy  shortly after plato died  aristotle left athens and  at the request of philip ii of macedon  tutored alexander the great beginning in 343  alexander the great gave aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies  he established a library in the lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books  which were written on papyrus the fact that aristotle was a pupil of plato contributed to his former views of platonism  but  following plato s death  aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from platonism to he believed all peoples  concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception  aristotle s views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works aristotle s views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship  their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance  and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics  some of aristotle s zoological observations  such as on the hectocotyl  reproductive  arm of the octopus  were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th  century  his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic  which was incorporated in the late 19th  century into modern formal logic in metaphysics  aristotelianism profoundly influenced jewish and islamic philosophical and theological thought during the middle ages and continues to influence christian theology  especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church  aristotle was well known among medieval muslim scholars  and has been revered as  the first teacher   arabic  المعلم الأول‎‎  his ethics  though always influential  gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics  all aspects of aristotle s philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today  though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues – cicero described his literary style as  a river of – it is thought that only around a third of his original output has whose name means  the best was born in 384  bc in stagira  chalcidice  about 55  km (34  miles  east of modern-day  his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon  aristotle was orphaned at a young age  although there is little information on aristotle s childhood  he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace  making his first connections with the macedonian the age of seventeen or eighteen  aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at plato s he remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving athens in 348/47  bc  the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academy s direction after control passed to plato s nephew speusippus  although it is possible that he feared anti-macedonian  sentiments and left before plato then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor  there  he traveled with theophrastus to the island of lesbos  where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island  aristotle married pythias  either hermias s adoptive daughter or niece  she bore him a daughter  whom they also named pythias  soon after hermias  death  aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander in 343  was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon  during that time he gave lessons not only to alexander  but also to two other future kings  ptolemy and aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric  in one famous example  he counsels alexander to be  a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians  to look after the former as after friends and relatives  and to deal with the latter as with beasts or 335  bc  aristotle had returned to athens  establishing his own school there known as the lyceum  aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years  while in athens  his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira  who bore him a son whom he named after his father  nicomachus  according to the suda  he also had an eromenos  palaephatus of period in athens  between 335  and 323  bc  is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived  those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not  for the most part  intended for widespread publication  they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students  his most important treatises include physics  metaphysics  nicomachean ethics  politics  de anima  on the soul  and poetics aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time  but made significant contributions to most of them  in physical science  aristotle studied anatomy  astronomy  embryology  geography  geology  meteorology  physics and zoology  in philosophy  he wrote on aesthetics  ethics  government  metaphysics  politics  economics  psychology  rhetoric and theology  he also studied education  foreign customs  literature and poetry  his combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of greek knowledge near the end of his life  alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexander s relationship with persia and persians  a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexander s death  but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the alexander s death  anti-macedonian  sentiment in athens was rekindled  in 322  bc  demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for prompting him to flee to his mother s family estate in chalcis  on euboea  at which occasion he was said to have stated   i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against – a reference to athens s prior trial and execution of socrates  he died on euboea of natural causes later that same year  having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his walston argues that the tomb of aristotle is located on the sacred way between chalcis and eretria and to have contained two styluses  a pen  a signet-ring  and some terra-cottas  as well as what is supposed to be the earthly remains of aristotle in the form of some skull general  the details of the life of aristotle are not well-established.  the biographies of aristotle written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient authenticity disputedwith the prior analytics  aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until 19th  century advances in mathematical kant stated in the critique of pure reason  preface to the second edition  1787)  that with aristotle logic reached its completion aristotle  says that  on the subject of reasoning  he  had nothing else on an earlier date to speak however  plato reports that syntax was devised before him  by prodicus of ceos  who was concerned by the correct use of words  logic seems to have emerged from dialectics  the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like reductio ad absurdum in their discussions  but never truly understood the logical implications  even plato had difficulties with logic  although he had a reasonable conception of a deductive system  he could never actually construct one  thus he relied instead on his believed that deduction would simply follow from premises  hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion would logically follow  consequently  plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial  he never succeeded in devising such a method  but his best attempt was published in his book sophist  where he introduced his division we today call aristotelian logic  aristotle himself would have labeled  analytics   the term  logic  he reserved to mean dialectics  most of aristotle s work is probably not in its original form  because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers  the logical works of aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st  century ce the order of the books  or the teachings from which they are composed  is not certain  but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle s writings  it goes from the basics  the analysis of simple terms in the categories  the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation  to the study of more complex forms  namely  syllogisms  in the analytics  and dialectics  in the topics and sophistical refutations   the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu  the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning  there is one volume of aristotle s concerning logic not found in the organon  namely the fourth book of his teacher plato  aristotle s philosophy aims at the universal  aristotle s ontology  however  finds the universal in particular things  which he calls the essence of things  while in plato s ontology  the universal exists apart from particular things  and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar  for aristotle  therefore  epistemology is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences  while for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms  or ideas  and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these  for aristotle   form  still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is  instantiated  in a particular substance  see universals and particulars  below   in a certain sense  aristotle s method is both inductive and deductive  while plato s is essentially deductive from a priori aristotle s terminology   natural philosophy  is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world  and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics  biology and other natural sciences  in modern times  the scope of philosophy has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries  such as ethics and metaphysics  in which logic plays a major role  today s philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method  in contrast  aristotle s philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry in the larger sense of the word  aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning  which he also would describe as  science   note  however  that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term  scientific method   for aristotle   all science  dianoia  is either practical  poetical or theoretical   metaphysics 1025b25).  by practical science  he means ethics and politics  by poetical science  he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts  by theoretical science  he means physics  mathematics and logic  or  analytics   is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy  the divisions of aristotelian philosophy would consist of  (1)  logic  (2)  theoretical philosophy  including metaphysics  physics and mathematics  (3)  practical philosophy and (4)  poetical philosophy in the period between his two stays in athens  between his times at the academy and the lyceum  aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today  in fact  most of aristotle s life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science  aristotle s metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics  he did  however  perform original research in the natural sciences  e g   botany  zoology  physics  astronomy  chemistry  meteorology  and several other sciences aristotle s writings on science are largely qualitative  as opposed to quantitative  beginning in the 16th  century  scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences  and aristotle s work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate  his failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass  velocity  force and temperature  he had a conception of speed and temperature  but no quantitative understanding of them  which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices  like clocks and thermometers his writings provide an account of many scientific observations  a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors  for example  in his history of animals he claimed that human males have more teeth than in a similar vein  john philoponus  and later galileo  showed by simple experiments that aristotle s theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is on the other hand  aristotle refuted democritus s claim that the milky way was made up of  those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun s rays   pointing out  correctly  even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time  that  given  current astronomical demonstrations  that  the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun  then     the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of also had some scientific blind spots  he posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the metaphysics  which was widely accepted up until the 16th  century  from the 3rd  century to the 16th  century  the dominant view held that the earth was the rotational center of the universe because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by european thinkers during and after the renaissance  these thinkers often took aristotle s erroneous positions as given  which held back science in this however  aristotle s scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields  for instance  he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia  moreover  he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants as quoted from charles lyell s principles of geology he refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on  and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages  he instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up  and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized  he points to the growth of the nilotic delta since the time of homer  to the shallowing of the palus maeotis within sixty years from his own time     he alludes     to the upheaving of one of the eolian islands  previous to a volcanic eruption  the changes of the earth  he says  are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives  that they are overlooked  and the migrations of people after great catastrophes  and their removal to other regions  cause the event to be forgotten aristotle proposed a fifth element  aether  in addition to the four proposed earlier by empedocles each of the four earthly elements has its natural place  all that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe  i e   the center of the earth  water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center  air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere  fire tends toward the lunar sphere  in which the moon orbits   when elements are moved out of their natural place  they naturally move back towards it  this is  natural motion  – motion requiring no extrinsic cause  so  for example  in water  earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up  in air  rain falls and flame rises  outside all the other spheres  the heavenly  fifth element  manifested in the stars and planets  moves in the perfection of circles aristotle defined motion as the actuality of a potentiality as aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally  that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential  as a transition toward a potentially possible state  because actuality and potentiality are normally opposites in aristotle  other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous  or that the addition of the  as such  to the definition is critical to understanding suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors  his name aitia is traditionally translated as  cause   but it does not always refer to temporal sequence  it might be better translated as  explanation   but the traditional rendering will be employed here additionally  things can be causes of one another  causing each other reciprocally  as hard work causes fitness and vice versa  although not in the same way or function  the one is as the beginning of change  the other as the goal   thus aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect   moreover  aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects  its presence and absence may result in different outcomes  simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event  our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino  because it cannot fall of its own accord aristotle marked two modes of causation  proper  prior  causation and accidental  chance  causation  all causes  both proper and incidental  can be spoken of as actual or potential  and as generic or particular  the same language refers to the effects of causes  so that actual effects are assigned to operating causes  generic effects to generic causes  and particular effects to particular causes aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day  the second oldest written evidence of a camera obscura  after mozi c  400  bc  can be found in aristotle s documentation of such a device in 350  bc in problemata  aristotle s apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole  or aperture  to allow for sunlight to enter  aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was  the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object  in modern cameras  this is analogous to the diaphragm  aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased  the image was to aristotle  spontaneity and chance are causes of some things  distinguishable from other types of cause  chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things  it is  from what is spontaneous   but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance   for a better understanding of aristotle s conception of  chance  it might be better to think of  coincidence   something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place  but with the result of another thing  not intended  taking place for example  a person seeks donations  that person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum  however  if the person seeking the donations met the person donating  not for the purpose of collecting donations  but for some other purpose  aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance  it must be unusual that something happens by chance  in other words  if something happens all or most of the time  we cannot say that it is by chance there is also more specific kind of chance  which aristotle names  luck   that can only apply to human beings  because it is in the sphere of moral actions  according to aristotle  luck must involve choice  and thus deliberation   and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice   what is not capable of action cannot do anything by defines metaphysics as  the knowledge of immaterial being   or of  being in the highest degree of abstraction   he refers to metaphysics as  first philosophy   as well as  the theologic science  aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence  ousia  in his metaphysics  book vii   and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form  in book viii  he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum  or the stuff of which it is composed  for example  the matter of a house is the bricks  stones  timbers etc   or whatever constitutes the potential house  while the form of the substance is the actual house  namely  covering for bodies and chattels  or any other differentia  see also predicables  that let us define something as a house  the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter  and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the regard to the change  kinesis  and its causes now  as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption 319b–320a,  he distinguishes the coming to be from the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property  in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality  dynamis  and actuality  entelecheia  in association with the matter and the form referring to potentiality  this is what a thing is capable of doing  or being acted upon  if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else  for example  the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially  dynamei  plant  and if is not prevented by something  it will become a plant  potentially beings can either  act   poiein  or  be acted upon   paschein   which can be either innate or learned  for example  the eyes possess the potentiality of sight  innate – being acted upon   while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning  exercise – acting  actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality  because the end  telos  is the principle of every change  and for the sake of the end exists potentiality  therefore actuality is the end  referring then to our previous example  we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do for that for the sake of which a thing is  is its principle  and the becoming is for the sake of the end  and the actuality is the end  and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired  for animals do not see in order that they may have sight  but they have sight that they may summary  the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities  which is also a final cause or end  then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula  in time and in substantiality with this definition of the particular substance  i e   matter and form   aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings  for example   what is it that makes a man one   since  according to plato there are two ideas  animal and biped  how then is man a unity  however  according to aristotle  the potential being  matter  and the actual one  form  are one and the same predecessor  plato  argued that all things have a universal form  which could be either a property or a relation to other things  when we look at an apple  for example  we see an apple  and we can also analyze a form of an apple  in this distinction  there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple  moreover  we can place an apple next to a book  so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things  for example  it is possible that there is no particular good in existence  but  good  is still a proper universal form  bertrand russell is a 20th-century  philosopher who agreed with plato on the existence of  uninstantiated universals  aristotle disagreed with plato on this point  arguing that all universals are instantiated  aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things  according to aristotle  if a universal exists  either as a particular or a relation  then there must have been  must be currently  or must be in the future  something on which the universal can be predicated  consequently  according to aristotle  if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time  then it does not exist in addition  aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals  as plato spoke of the world of the forms  a location where all universal forms subsist  aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated  so  according to aristotle  the form of apple exists within each apple  rather than in the world of the forms in aristotelian science  especially in biology  things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others  which contain error and superstition  he dissected animals but not humans  his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail  aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of lesbos  and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas  the works that reflect this research  the history of animals  generation of animals  movement of animals  and parts of animals  contain some observations and interpretations  along with sundry myths and mistakes  the most striking passages are about the sea-life  visible from observation on lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen  his observations on catfish  electric fish  torpedo  and angler-fish  are detailed  as is his writing on cephalopods  namely  octopus  sepia  cuttlefish  and the paper nautilus  argonauta argo   his description of the hectocotyl arm  used in sexual reproduction  was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th  century  he separated the aquatic mammals from fish  and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called selachē  greek for example of his methods  including dissection and observation  comes from the generation of animals  where he describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to discover the sequence in which visible organs are gave accurate descriptions of the four-chambered  fore-stomachs  of ruminants  and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark mustelus distinguished about 500  species of birds  mammals and what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates  aristotle called  animals with blood  and  animals without blood   animals with blood were divided into live-bearing   mammals   and egg-bearing   birds and fish   invertebrates   animals without blood   are insects  crustacea  divided into non-shelled  – cephalopods – and shelled  and testacea  molluscs  aristotle believed that intellectual purposes  i e   final causes  guided all natural processes  such a teleological view gave aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design  noting that  no animal has  at the same time  both tusks and horns   and  a single-hooved  animal with two horns i have never seen   aristotle suggested that nature  giving no animal both horns and tusks  was staving off vanity  and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary  noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth  he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter  with nature trying to preserve a type of stated in the history of animals that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from minerals to plants and animals  and on up to man  forming the scala naturae or great chain of his system had eleven grades  arranged according  to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality   expressed in their form at birth  the highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive  the lowest bore theirs cold  dry  and in thick eggs  for charles singer   nothing is more remarkable than efforts to the relationships of living things as a scala also held that the level of a creature s perfection was reflected in its form  but not preordained by that form  ideas like this  and his ideas about souls  are not regarded as science at all in modern times he placed emphasis on the type s  of soul an organism possessed  asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul  responsible for reproduction and growth  animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul  responsible for mobility and sensation  and humans a vegetative  a sensitive  and a rational soul  capable of thought and in contrast to earlier philosophers  but in accordance with the egyptians  placed the rational soul in the heart  rather than the notable is aristotle s division of sensation and thought  which generally went against previous philosophers  with the exception of successor at the lyceum  theophrastus  wrote a series of books on botany – the history of plants – which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany  even into the middle ages  many of theophrastus  names survive into modern times  such as carpos for fruit  and pericarpion for seed vessel rather than focus on formal causes  as aristotle did  theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme  drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes  and relying on aristotle s concept of the efficient cause  theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants  though this last discovery was lost in later theophrastus  the lyceum failed to produce any original work  though interest in aristotle s ideas survived  they were generally taken it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found the first medical teacher at alexandria  herophilus of chalcedon  corrected aristotle  placing intelligence in the brain  and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation  herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries  noting that the latter pulse while the former do though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life  teleology  and after the rise of christianity  natural theology  would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th  and 19th  centuries  ernst mayr claimed that there was  nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the aristotle s ideas of natural history and medicine survived  but they were generally taken psychology  given in his treatise on the soul  peri psyche  often known by its latin title de anima   posits three kinds of soul   psyches    the vegetative soul  the sensitive soul  and the rational soul  humans have a rational soul  this kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds  like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself  like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally  the unique part of the human  rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them for aristotle  the soul  psyche  was a simpler concept than it is for us today  by soul he simply meant the form of a living being  because all beings are composites of form and matter  the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings  e g  the ability to initiate movement  or in the case of plants  growth and chemical transformations  which aristotle considers types of to aristotle  memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal  appearance  and an occurrence in the in other words  a memory is a mental picture  phantasm  in which aristotle defines in de anima  as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory  aristotle believed an  imprint  becomes impressed on a semi-fluid  bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory  a memory occurs when a stimuli is too complex that the nervous system (semi-fluid  bodily organ  cannot receive all the impressions at once  these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation  common sense  and thinking the mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception  it does not matter if the experience was seen or heard  every experience ends up as a mental image in memory uses the word  memory  for two basic abilities  first  the actual retaining of the experience in the mnemonic  imprint  that can develop from sensation  second  the intellectual anxiety that comes with the  imprint  due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents  these abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time  therefore  memory is of the past  prediction is of the future  and sensation is of the present  the retrieval of our  imprints  cannot be performed suddenly  a transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences  both for our previous experience and present experience aristotle proposed that slow-witted  people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the  imprint  can easily continue  however  they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new  imprints   he believed the young and the old do not properly develop an  imprint   young people undergo rapid changes as they develop  while the elderly s organs are beginning to decay  thus stunting new  imprints   likewise  people who are too quick-witted  are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ  because intellectual functions are not involved in memory  memories belong to some animals too  but only those in which have perception of time because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or  imprints   people are continually weaving together new  imprints  of things they experience  in order to search for these  imprints   people search the memory within the memory  if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory  that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for  recollection occurs when one experience naturally follows another  if the chain of  images  is needed  one memory will stimulate the other  if the chain of  images  is not needed  but expected  then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances  when people recall experiences  they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was is the self-directed  activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory  imprint  after some time has passed  retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being  human or animal  and the abilities the human or animal only humans will remember  imprints  of intellectual activity  such as numbers and words  animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations  remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed  recollection of an  imprint  is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences  when an  imprint  is recalled  it may bring forth a large group of related believed the chain of thought  which ends in recollection of certain  imprints   was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships  similarity  contrast  and contiguity  these three laws make up his laws of association  aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind  a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience  according to aristotle  association is the power innate in a mental state  which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences  allowing them to rise and be understanding aristotle s views on dreams  first his idea of sleep must be examined  aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in on sleep and sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the or of so it is vital to the body  including the senses  so it can be while a person is asleep  the critical activities  which include thinking  sensing  recalling and remembering  do not function as they do during since a person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have a desire  which is the result of a however  the senses are able to work during albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory also  not all of the senses are inactive during sleep  only the ones that are do not involve actually sensing a stimulus because  as discussed  the senses do not work as they normally do during in dreams  sensation is still involved  but in an altered manner than when aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of when they look away from that stimulus  the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion  when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention  it leaves an when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly  a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become however  during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were so  dreams result from these lasting impressions  since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli  dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when sleep  a person is in an altered state of aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a for example  a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their when a person is asleep  their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state  they become easily deceived by what appears in their asleep  a person is unable to make judgments as they do when they are due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep  they are unable to help a person judge what is happening in their this in turn leads the person to believe the dream is dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or so  the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it one component of aristotle s theory of dreams introduces ideas that are contradictory to previously held he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and that they are not sent by a divine aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not these ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams  but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to also includes in his theory of dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not  he claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it secondly  any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a for example  if  while a person is sleeping  a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut  aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the the actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses  the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the lastly  the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study  i e   one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake  he wrote several treatises on ethics  including most notably  the nicomachean ethics aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function  ergon  of a thing  an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see  because the proper function of an eye is sight  aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans  and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē  normally translated as soul  in accordance with reason  logos   aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action  eudaimonia  generally translated as  happiness  or sometimes  well being   to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character  ēthikē aretē   often translated as moral  or ethical  virtue  or taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately  but by teachers  and experience  leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things  when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom  phronesis  and their intellect  nous  can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue  the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker  or in other words  a addition to his works on ethics  which address the individual  aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics  aristotle considered the city to be a natural community  moreover  he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual   for the whole must of necessity be prior to the he also famously stated that  man is by nature a political animal  and also arguing that humanity s defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine  and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others  aristotle s conception of the city is organic  and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotle s understanding  although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires  the natural community according to aristotle was the city  polis  which functions as a political  community  or  partnership   koinōnia   the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability  but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life  and to perform beautiful acts   the political partnership must be regarded  therefore  as being for the sake of noble actions  not for the sake of living together   this is distinguished from modern approaches  beginning with social contract theory  according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of  fear of violent death  or its from a speech by the character  aristotle  in the book protrepticus  hutchinson and johnson  2015  p  considered epic poetry  tragedy  comedy  dithyrambic poetry and music to be imitative  each varying in imitation by medium  object  and for example  music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony  whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone  and poetry with language  the forms also differ in their object of imitation  comedy  for instance  is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average  whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average  lastly  the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character  through change or no change  and through drama or no aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind s advantages over it is believed that aristotle s poetics comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived  aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements  plot-structure,  character  style  thought  spectacle  and lyric the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story  and the plot  not the characters  is the chief focus of tragedy  tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear  and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions  aristotle concludes poetics with a discussion on which  if either  is superior  epic or tragic mimesis  he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic  possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music  is more unified  and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope  it can be considered superior to was a keen systematic collector of riddles  folklore  and proverbs  he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of analysis of procreation describes an active  ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert  passive female element  on this ground  feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of and however  aristotle gave equal weight to women s happiness as he did to men s  and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as wrote his works on papyrus scrolls  or rolls  which was the common writing medium of that modern scholarship reveals that aristotle s  lost  works stray considerably in from the surviving aristotelian corpus  whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication  the surviving works do not appear to have been rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for the authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally aristotelian is also today held suspect  with some books duplicating or summarizing each other  the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely aristotle s at of the individual works within the corpus  including the constitution of athens  are regarded by most scholars as products of aristotle s  school   perhaps compiled under his direction or others  such as on colors  may have been produced by aristotle s successors at the lyceum  e g   theophrastus and straton  still others acquired aristotle s name through similarities in doctrine or content  such as the de plantis  possibly by nicolaus of damascus  other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and astrological and magical texts whose connections to aristotle are purely fanciful and to a distinction that originates with aristotle himself  his writings are divisible into two groups  the  exoteric  and the most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works aristotle intended for the public  exoteric   and the more technical works intended for use within the lyceum course   school modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be aristotle s own  unpolished  lecture notes  or in some cases possible notes by his however  one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation  the 5th  century neoplatonist ammonius hermiae writes that aristotle s writing style is deliberately obscurantist so that  good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more  whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant – that all of aristotle s extant writings are of the esoteric kind  current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious  though many of them may have been in dialogue form   fragments of some of aristotle s dialogues have survived   perhaps it is to these that cicero refers when he characterized aristotle s writing style as  a river of it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to however  some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that cicero s praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works  a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in aristotle s extant major question in the history of aristotle s works  then  is how were the exoteric writings all lost  and how did the ones we now possess come to the story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by strabo in his geography and plutarch in his parallel the manuscripts were left from aristotle to his successor theophrastus  who in turn willed them to neleus of scepsis  neleus supposedly took the writings from athens to scepsis  where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st  century bc  when apellicon of teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts  bringing them back to athens  according to the story  apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts  stay in the basement  introducing a number of errors into the text  when lucius cornelius sulla occupied athens in 86  bc  he carried off the library of apellicon to rome  where they were first published in 60  bc by the grammarian tyrannion of amisus and then by the philosopher andronicus of lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides  the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the peripatetic school after the middle of the third century  and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of aristotle throughout the hellenistic period  as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing aristotelianism during the first century lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story  however  first  the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by apellicon s inexpert attempt at repair second  there is  incontrovertible evidence   lord says  that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which strabo and plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in scepsis  third  the definitive edition of aristotle s texts seems to have been made in athens some fifty years before andronicus supposedly compiled his  and fourth  ancient library catalogues predating andronicus  intervention list an aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess  lord sees a number of post-aristotelian  interpolations in the politics  for example  but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact on the one hand  the surviving texts of aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts  but rather from working drafts used within aristotle s school  as opposed  on the other hand  to the dialogues and other  exoteric  texts which aristotle published more widely during his lifetime  the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotle s school which existed in the form of smaller  separate works  distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics  edited them  and finally compiled them into the more cohesive  larger works as they are known than 2300  years after his death  aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived  he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence  and he was the founder of many new fields  according to the philosopher bryan magee   it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he among countless other achievements  aristotle was the founder of formal pioneered the study of zoology  and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific these achievements  the influence of aristotle s errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably  bertrand russell notes that  almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine   russell also refers to aristotle s ethics as  repulsive   and calls his logic  as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy   russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle  until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his immediate influence of aristotle s work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school  aristotle s notable students included aristoxenus  dicaearchus  demetrius of phalerum  eudemos of rhodes  harpalus  hephaestion  mnason of phocis  nicomachus  and theophrastus  aristotle s influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter s bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists  botanists  and researchers  he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher  although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle s geography was clearly wrong  when the old philosopher released his works to the public  alexander complained  thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines  for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all men s common christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus  the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were john philoponus  elias  and david in the sixth century  and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotle s views on the eternity of the world  movement  and other elements of aristotelian after a hiatus of several centuries  formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries  apparently sponsored by anna was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology  most of the still extant works of as well as a number of the original greek commentaries  were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers  scientists and scholars  averroes  avicenna and alpharabius  who wrote on aristotle in great depth  also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers  alkindus considered aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of and averroes spoke of aristotle as the  exemplar  for all future medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the  first the title  teacher  was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars  and was later used by western philosophers  as in the famous poem of dante  who were influenced by the tradition of islamic accordance with the greek theorists  the muslims considered aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher  the author of a closed system  and believed that aristotle shared with plato essential tenets of thought  some went so far as to credit aristotle himself with neo-platonic  metaphysical the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west  aristotle was practically unknown there from c  ad 600  to c  1100  except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius  in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries  interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made  both from arabic translations  such as those by gerard of and from the original greek  such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke after thomas aquinas wrote his theology  working from moerbeke s translations  the demand for aristotle s writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west  stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the aristotle is referred to as  the philosopher  by scholastic thinkers such as thomas aquinas  see summa theologica  part i  question 3,  etc    these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity  bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages  it required a repudiation of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods  the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by havingat his beddes heed twenty bookes  clad in blak or reed  of aristotle and his italian poet dante says of aristotle in the first circles of hell vidi  l maestro di color che sanno seder tra filosofica famiglia  tutti lo miran  tutti onor li fanno  quivi vid ïo socrate e platone che  nnanzi a li altri più presso li stanno i saw the master there of those who know  amid the philosophic family  by all admired  and by all reverenced  there plato too i saw  and socrates  who stood beside him closer than

 aristotle rigidly separated action from production  and argued for the deserved subservience of some people   natural slaves    and the natural superiority  virtue  arete  of others  it is martin heidegger  not nietzsche  who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle  intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition  ayn rand accredited aristotle as  the greatest philosopher in history  and cited him as a major influence on her thinking  more recently  alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist  and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum  these texts  as opposed to aristotle s lost works  are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotle s school  reference to them is made according to the organization of
