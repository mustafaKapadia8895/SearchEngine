 the barbary pirates  sometimes called barbary corsairs or ottoman corsairs  were pirates and privateers who operated from north africa  based primarily in the ports of salé  rabat  algiers  tunis  and tripoli  this area was known in europe as the barbary coast  a term derived from the name of its berber inhabitants  their predation extended throughout the mediterranean  south along west africa s atlantic seaboard and even south and into the north atlantic as far north as iceland  but they primarily operated in the western mediterranean  in addition to seizing ships  they engaged in razzias  raids on european coastal towns and villages  mainly in italy  france  spain  and portugal  but also in the british the needed  and as far away as the main purpose of their attacks was to capture christian slaves for the ottoman slave trade as well as the general muslim slavery market in north africa and the middle such raids had occurred since soon after the muslim conquest of iberia  the terms  barbary pirates  and  barbary corsairs  are normally applied to the raiders active from the 16th  century onwards  when the frequency and range of the slavers  attacks increased  in that period algiers  tunis and tripoli came under the sovereignty of the ottoman empire  either as directly administered provinces or as autonomous dependencies known as the barbary states  similar raids were undertaken from salé and other ports in morocco corsairs captured thousands of ships and repeatedly raided coastal towns  as a result  residents abandoned their former villages of long stretches of coast in spain and italy  the raids were such a problem coastal settlements were seldom undertaken until the 19th  century  between 1580  and 1680  corsairs captured about 850,000  people as slaves and from 1530  to 1780  as many as 1,250,000  people were some corsairs were european outcasts and converts such as john ward and zymen hayreddin barbarossa and oruç reis  turkish barbarossa brothers  who took control of algiers on behalf of the ottomans in the early 16th  century  were also notorious corsairs  the european pirates brought advanced sailing and shipbuilding techniques to the barbary coast around 1600,  which enabled the corsairs to extend their activities into the atlantic the effects of the barbary raids peaked in the early to mid-17th  century the scope of corsair activity began to diminish in the latter part of the 17th  as the more powerful european navies started to compel the barbary states to make peace and cease attacking their shipping  however  the ships and coasts of christian states without such effective protection continued to suffer until the early 19th  century  following the napoleonic wars and the congress of vienna in 1814–15,  european powers agreed upon the need to suppress the barbary corsairs entirely and the threat was largely subdued  occasional incidents occurred  including two barbary wars between the united states and the barbary states  until finally terminated by the french conquest of algiers in 1830.piracy  by muslim populations had been known in the mediterranean since at least the 9th  century and the short-lived  emirate of crete  the provence was plagued by saracen slave raids in the carolingian era  in 869,  archbishop rotlandus of arles was captured  and died before he could be released after the payment of a ransom in weapons  treasure and slaves  the level of muslim pirate activity was relatively needed   but in the 13th  and 14th  centuries pirates from christian states  particularly catalonia  were a constant threat to merchants who traded by needed in 1198  the problem of berber piracy and slave-taking  was so great that a religious order  the trinitarians were founded to collect ransoms and even to exchange themselves as ransom for those captured and pressed into slavery in north africa  in the 14th  century tunisian corsairs became enough of a threat to provoke a franco-genoese  attack on mahdia in 1390,  also known as the  barbary crusade   morisco exiles of the reconquista and maghreb pirates added to the numbers  but it was not until the expansion of the ottoman empire and the arrival of the privateer and admiral kemal reis in 1487  that the barbary corsairs became a true menace to shipping from european christian barbary pirates had long attacked english and other european shipping along the north coast of africa  they had been attacking english merchant and passengers ships since the 1600s.  regular fundraising for ransoms was undertaken generally by families and local church groups  who generally raised the ransoms for individuals  the government did not ransom ordinary persons  the english became familiar with captivity narratives written by barbary pirates  prisoners and ransomed captives  as so many people were taken  after english colonists began to go to north america and be taken captive by native americans  both the colonists and people in england had some basis for considering the meaning of captivity for a christian in an alien the american revolution the pirates attacked american ships  but  on december 20,  1777,  sultan mohammed iii of morocco declared that american merchant ships would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage into the mediterranean and along the coast  the moroccan-american  treaty of friendship stands as the u s  s oldest non-broken  friendship with a foreign power  in 1778  morocco became the first nation to recognize the new united late as 1798,  an islet near sardinia was attacked by the tunisians  and more than 900  inhabitants were taken away as throughout history  geography was on the pirates  side on the northern coast of africa  the coast was ideal for their wants and needs  with natural harbours often backed by lagoons  it provided a haven for guerrilla warfare  such as attacks on shipping vessels venturing through their territory  on the coast  mountainous areas provided ample reconnaissance for the corsairs as well  ships were spotted from afar  the pirates had time to prepare their attacks and surprise the ships moors and turkish adventurers from the levant  of whom the most successful were hızır and oruç  natives of mitylene  increased the number of raids around the turn of the 15th  century  in response  spain began to conquer the coastal towns of oran  algiers and tunis  but after oruç was killed in battle with the spanish in 1518,  his brother hızır appealed to selim i  the ottoman sultan  who sent him troops  in 1529,  hızır drove the spaniards from the rocky  fortified island in front of algiers  and founded the ottoman power in the region  from about 1518  till the death of uluç ali in 1587,  algiers was the main seat of government of the beylerbeys of northern africa  who ruled over tripoli  tunisia and algeria  from 1587  to 1659,  they were ruled by ottoman pashas  sent from constantinople to govern for three years  but in the latter year a military revolt in algiers reduced the pashas to nonentities from 1659,  these african cities  although nominally part of the ottoman empire  were in fact military republics that chose their own rulers and lived by war booty captured from the spanish and portuguese  there are several cases of sephardic jews  including sinan reis and samuel pallache  who upon fleeing iberia turned to attacking the spanish empire s shipping under the ottoman flag  a profitable strategy of revenge for the inquisition s religious the first period (1518–1587),  the beylerbeys were admirals of the sultan  commanding great fleets and conducting war operations for political ends  they were slave-hunters  and their methods were ferocious  after 1587,  the sole object of their successors became plunder  on land and sea  the maritime operations were conducted by the captains  or reises  who formed a class or even a corporation  cruisers were fitted out by investors and commanded by the reises  ten percent of the value of the prizes was paid to the pasha or his successors  who bore the titles of agha or dey or 1544  hayreddin captured the island of ischia  taking 4,000  prisoners  and enslaved some 2,000-3,000  inhabitants of in 1551  turgut reis enslaved the entire population of the maltese island of gozo  between 5,000  and 6,000,  sending them to ottoman tripolitania  in 1554  corsairs under turgut reis sacked vieste  beheaded 5,000  of its inhabitants  and abducted another in 1555  turgut reis sacked bastia  corsica  taking 6,000  prisoners  in 1558,  barbary corsairs captured the town of ciutadella  minorca   destroyed it  murdered many inhabitants  and took 3,000  to constantinople as in 1563  turgut reis landed on the shores of the province of granada  spain  and captured coastal settlements in the area  such as almuñécar  along with 4,000  prisoners  barbary corsairs often attacked the balearic islands  and in response many coastal watchtowers and fortified churches were erected  the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera even at this early stage  the european states fought back  livorno s monument quattro mori celebrates 16th-century  victories against the barbary corsairs won by the knights of malta and the order of saint stephen  of which the grand duke of tuscany ferdinando i de  medici was grand master  another response was the construction of the original frigates  light  fast and maneuverable galleys  designed to run down barbary corsairs trying to get away with their loot and slaves  other measures included coastal lookouts to give warning for people to withdraw into fortified places and rally local forces to fight the corsairs  this latter goal was especially difficult to achieve as the corsairs had the advantage of surprise  the vulnerable european mediterranean coasts were very long and easily accessible from the north african barbary bases  and the corsairs were careful in planning their raids during the first half of the 17th  century  barbary raiding was at its peak  this was due largely to the contribution of dutch corsairs  notably zymen danseker  simon de danser   who used the barbary ports as bases for attacking spanish shipping during the dutch revolt  they cooperated with local raiders and introduced them to the latest dutch sailing rigs  enabling them to brave atlantic some of these dutch corsairs converted to islam and settled permanently in north africa  two examples are süleyman reis   de veenboer   who became admiral of the algerian corsair fleet in 1617,  and his quartermaster murat reis  born jan janszoon  both worked for the notorious dutch corsair zymen danseker a notable counter action occurred in 1607,  when the knights of saint stephen  under jacopo inghirami  sacked bona in algeria  killing 470  and taking 1,464  this victory is commemorated by a series of frescoes painted by bernardino poccetti in the  sala di bona  of palazzo pitti  in 1611  spanish galleys from naples  accompanied by the galleys of the knights of malta  raided the kerkennah islands off the coast of tunisia and took away almost 500  muslim between 1568  and 1634  the knights of saint stephen may have captured about 14,000  muslims  with perhaps one-third  taken in land raids and two-thirds  taken on captured corsair attacks were common in southern portugal  south and east spain  the balearic islands  the canary islands  sardinia  corsica  elba  the italian peninsula  especially the tyrrhenian coast   sicily and malta  they also occurred on the atlantic northwest coast of the iberian peninsula as in 1617,  when the north african corsairs launched their major attack in the region  they destroyed and sacked bouzas  cangas do morrazo and the churches of moaña and darbo occasionally coastal raids reached farther afield  iceland was subject to raids in 1627.  jan janszoon   murat reis the younger  is said to have taken 400  prisoners  242  of the captives later were sold into slavery on the barbary coast  the corsairs took only young people and those in good physical condition  all those offering resistance were killed  and the old people were gathered into a church which was set on fire  among those captured was ólafur egilsson  who was ransomed the next year  upon returning to iceland  he wrote an account about his experience  such captivity narratives by europeans who had been held in muslim states eventually constituted a literary genre ireland was subject to a similar attack  in june 1631  murat reis  with corsairs from algiers and armed troops of the ottoman empire  stormed ashore at the little harbor village of baltimore  county cork  they captured almost all the villagers and took them away to a life of slavery in north the prisoners were destined for a variety of fates — some lived out their days chained to the oars as galley slaves  while women spent long years as concubines in harems or within the walls of the sultan s palace  only two of these captives ever returned to needed more than 20,000  captives were said to be imprisoned in algiers alone  the rich were often able to secure release through ransom  but the poor were condemned to slavery  their masters would on occasion allow them to secure freedom by professing islam  a long list might be given of people of good social position  not only italians or spaniards  but german or english travelers in the south  who were captives for a while the chief victims were the inhabitants of the coasts of sicily  naples and spain  all traders of nations which did not pay tribute for immunity or force the barbary states to leave them alone were liable to be taken at sea  religious orders — the redemptorists and lazarists — worked for the redemption of captives  and in many countries the wealthy left legacies to support such redemptions barbary piracy thrived on the competition among european powers  france encouraged the corsairs against spain  and later britain and holland supported them against france  by the second half of the 17th  century  the greater european naval powers were able to strike back effectively enough to intimidate the barbary states into making peace with them  however  those countries  commercial interests benefited by the pirates continuing attacks on their competitors  as a result  they did not cooperate to impose a more general cessation of corsair activity england was the most successful of the christian states in dealing with the corsair needed  from the 1630s  onwards england had signed peace treaties with the barbary states on various occasions  but invariably breaches of these agreements led to renewed wars  a particular bone of contention was the tendency of foreign ships to pose as english to avoid attack  however  growing english naval power and increasingly persistent operations against the corsairs proved increasingly costly for the barbary states  during the reign of charles ii a series of english expeditions won victories over raiding barbary squadrons and mounted attacks on their home ports  these actions permanently ended the barbary threat to english shipping  in 1675  a royal navy squadron led by sir john narborough negotiated a lasting peace with tunis and  after bombarding the city to induce compliance  with tripoli  peace with salé followed in 1676.algiers,  the most powerful of the barbary states  returned to war the following year  breaking a treaty made in 1671.  after suffering defeats at the hands of an english squadron under arthur herbert  algiers made peace again in 1682,  in a treaty that lasted until 1816.  france  which had recently emerged as a leading naval power  achieved comparable success soon afterwards  it bombarded algiers in 1682,  1683  and 1688  to secure a lasting peace  and forced tripoli to sue for peace by bombardment in 1686.a  2016  study found that barbary corsairs were less militarily powerful after 1675  than they were at the start of the seventeenth was enough of a problem that some states entered into the redemption business  in denmark   at the beginning of the 18th  century money was collected systematically in all churches  and a so called ‘slave fund’  slavekasse  was established by the state in 1715.  funds were brought in through a compulsory insurance sum for seafarers  165  slaves were ransomed by this institution between 1716  and  between 1716  and 1754  19  ships from denmark-norway  were captured with 208  men  piracy was thus a serious problem for the danish merchant the late 18th  century piracy began to arise again  in 1783  and 1784  the spanish bombarded algiers to end piracy  the second time admiral barceló damaged the city so severely that the algerian dey asked spain to negotiate a peace treaty  from then on spanish vessels and coasts were safe for several years  separately  the danish attacked tripoli in 1797.until  the american declaration of independence in 1776,  british treaties with the north african states protected american ships from the barbary corsairs  morocco  which in 1777  was the first independent nation to publicly recognize the united states  in 1784  became the first barbary power to seize an american vessel after the nation achieved independence  the barbary threat led directly to the united states founding the united states navy in march 1794.  while the united states did secure peace treaties with the barbary states  it was obliged to pay tribute for protection from attack  the burden was substantial  in 1800  payments in ransom and tribute to the barbary states amounted to 20%  of united states federal government s annual the united states conducted the first barbary war in 1801  and the second barbary war in 1815  to gain more favorable peace terms  it ended the payment of tribute  but  algiers broke the 1805  peace treaty after two years  and refused to implement the 1815  treaty until compelled to do so by britain in 1816.the  congress of vienna (1814–5),  which ended the napoleonic wars  led to increased european consensus on the need to end barbary raiding  the sacking of palma on the island of sardinia by a tunisian squadron  which carried off 158  inhabitants  roused widespread indignation  britain had by this time banned the slave trade and was seeking to induce other countries to do likewise  states that were more vulnerable to the corsairs complained that britain cared more for ending the trade in african slaves than stopping the enslavement of europeans and americans by the barbary states in order to neutralise this objection and further the anti-slavery  campaign  in 1816  britain sent lord exmouth to secure new concessions from tripoli  tunis  and algiers  including a pledge to treat christian captives in any future conflict as prisoners of war rather than slaves  he imposed peace between algiers and the kingdoms of sardinia and sicily  on his first visit  lord exmouth negotiated satisfactory treaties and sailed for home  while he was negotiating  a number of sardinian fishermen who had settled at bona on the tunisian coast were brutally treated without his knowledge  as sardinians they were technically under british protection  the government sent exmouth back to secure reparation  on august 17,  in combination with a dutch squadron under admiral van de capellen  exmouth bombarded algiers  both algiers and tunis made fresh concessions as a result the barbary states had difficulty securing uniform compliance with a total prohibition of slave-raiding,  as this had been traditionally of central importance to the north african economy  slavers continued to take captives by preying on less well-protected  peoples  algiers subsequently renewed its slave-raiding,  though on a smaller scale  europeans at the congress of aix-la-chapelle  in 1818  discussed possible retaliation  in 1820  a british fleet under admiral sir harry neal bombarded algiers  corsair activity based in algiers did not entirely cease until france conquered the state in barbary corsairs looted the cargo of ships they captured  their primary goal was to capture people for sale as slaves or for ransom  those who had family or friends who might ransom them were held captive but not obliged to work  the most famous of these was the author miguel de cervantes  who was held for almost five years  others were sold into various types of servitude  attractive women or boys could be used as sex slaves and was considered the original  fate worse than death   captives who converted to islam were generally freed  since enslavement of muslims was prohibited  but this meant that they could never return to their native robert c  davis estimated that between 1530  and 1780,  1–1.25  million europeans were captured and taken as slaves to north africa  principally algiers  tunis  and tripoli  but also constantinople and often suffered from privation on voyages to north africa if taken at a distance  those who survived the journeys were often forced to walk through town as they were taken to slave auctions  the slaves typically had to stand from eight in the morning until two in the afternoon while buyers viewed needed  next came the auction  where the townspeople would bid on the captives they wanted to purchase and once that was over  the governor of algiers  the dey  had the chance to purchase any slave he wanted for the price they were sold at the auction  during the auctions the slaves would be forced to run and jump around to show their strength and stamina  after purchase  the captives would either be held for ransom  or be put to work  slaves were used for a wide variety of jobs  from hard manual labor to housework  the job assigned to most women slaves   at night the slaves were put into prisons called  bagnios   derived from the italian word  bagno  for public bath  inspired by the turks  use of roman baths at constantinople as which were often hot and overcrowded  however  these bagnios began improving by the 18th  century  some bagnios had chapels  hospitals  shops  and bars run by captives  though such amenities remained uncommon although the conditions in bagnios were harsh  they were better than those endured by galley slaves  most barbary galleys were at sea for around eighty to a hundred days a year  but when the slaves assigned to them were on land  they were forced to do hard manual labor  there were exceptions   galley slaves of the ottoman sultan in constantinople would be permanently confined to their galleys  and often served extremely long terms  averaging around nineteen years in the late seventeenth-century  and early eighteenth-century  periods  these slaves rarely got off the galley but lived there for during this time  rowers were shackled and chained where they sat  and never allowed to leave  sleeping  which was limited   eating  defecation and urination took place at the seat to which they were shackled  there were usually five or six rowers on each oar  overseers would walk back and forth and whip slaves considered not to be working hard enough barbary slaves could hope to be freed through payment of a ransom  despite the efforts of middlemen and charities to raise money to provide ransoms  they were still very difficult to come by  as european communities increased their charity funding for ransoming slaves  north african states increased the amount of ransom required  lack of money to pay a ransom was not the only problem  persons taken captive needed to notify their families of their status and tell them the ransom price  mail charges were often beyond the reach of ordinary captive slaves  and it could take several months for the mail to be delivered after payment of a ransom  slaves were often taken to a port to wait for the ransom to be finalized  in some cases in the 17th  and 18th  centuries  slaves were kept under quarantine due to fear of the plague threatening the life of the slave and payment of the ransom not many barbary slaves could depend on being ransomed by their communities  they had to be deemed worthy of it and many poor people were never ransomed  the tribute prices for the slaves usually varied based on their usefulness on a ship  so a ship master would cost more than a common seaman  escaping was another possibility  but rarely successful  cervantes  future author of don quijote  made four unsuccessful attempts to escape from slavery  and was eventually ransomed by his family  thomas pellow was a successful escaped slave who published his story in 1740.  after several failed attempts  in which he was nearly killed  pellow had finally escaped to gibraltar in july 1738.according  to historian adrian tinniswood  the most notorious corsairs were english and european renegades who had learned their trade as privateers  and who moved to the barbary coast during peacetime to pursue their trade  these outcasts brought up-to-date  naval expertise to the piracy business  and enabled the corsairs to make long-distance  slave-catching  raids as far away as iceland and the english corsair henry mainwaring later returned to england after gaining a royal pardon  he was knighted  elected to parliament  and appointed a vice admiral of the royal most famous of the corsairs in north africa were brothers oruç and hızır hayreddin  they  and two less well-known  brothers  all became barbary corsairs  they were called the barbarossas  italian for redbeards  after the red beard of oruç  the eldest  oruç captured the island of djerba for the ottoman empire in 1502  or 1503.  he often attacked spanish territories on the coast of north africa  during one failed attempt in 1512  he lost his left arm to a cannonball  the eldest barbarossa also went on a rampage through algiers in 1516,  and captured the town with the help of the ottoman empire  he executed the ruler of algiers and everybody he suspected would oppose him  including local rulers  he was finally captured and killed by the spanish in 1518,  and put on display oruç  based mainly on land  was not the best-known  of the barbarossas  his youngest brother hızır  later called hayreddin or kheir ed-din)  was a more traditional corsair  he was a capable engineer and spoke at least six languages  he dyed the hair of his head and beard with henna to redden it like oruç s  after capturing many crucial coastal areas  hayreddin was appointed admiral-in-chief  of the ottoman sultan s fleet  under his command the ottoman empire was able to gain and keep control of the eastern mediterranean for over thirty years  barbaros hızır hayreddin pasha died in 1546  of a fever  possibly the plague english corsair jack  or john  ward was once called  beyond doubt the greatest scoundrel that ever sailed from england  by the english ambassador to venice  ward was a privateer for queen elizabeth during her war with spain  after the end of the war  he became a corsair  with some associates he captured a ship in about 1603  and sailed it to tunis  he and his crew converted to islam  he was successful and became rich  he introduced heavily armed square-rigged  ships  used instead of galleys  to the north african area  a major reason for the barbary s future dominance of the mediterranean  he died of plague in 1622.sayyida  al-hurra  was a female muslim cleric  merchant  governor of tétouan  and later queen of she was born around 1485  in the emirate of granada  but was forced to flee to morocco when she was very young to escape the reconquista  in morocco  she gathered a crew largely of exiled moors  and launched pirate expeditions against spain and portugal to avenge the reconquista  protect morocco from christian pirates  and seek riches and glory  she co-founded  the barbary corsairs with her allies the barbarossa brothers  who divided the mediterranean between them—the barbarossas and their ottoman fleet operating in the east  and sayyida al-hurra  and her moorish and north-african  pirates operating in the west  sayyida al-hurra  became wealthy and renowned enough for the sultan of morocco  ahmad al-wattasi  to make her his queen  notably  however  she refused to marry in his capital of fez  and would not get married but in tétouan  of which she was governor  this was the first and only time in history that a moroccan monarch had married away from his capital barbary corsairs are protagonists in le pantere di algeri  the panthers of algiers  by emilio salgari  they were featured in a number of other noted novels  including robinson crusoe by daniel defoe  the count of monte cristo by alexandre dumas  père  the wind in the willows by kenneth grahame  the sea hawk and the sword of islam by rafael sabatini  the algerine captive by royall tyler  master and commander by patrick o brian  the baroque cycle by neal stephenson  the walking drum by louis lamour  doctor dolittle by hugh lofting  corsair by clive cussler and angélique in barbary by anne golon  miguel de cervantes  the spanish author  was captive for five years as a slave in the bagnio of algiers  and reflected his experience in some of his fictional  but not directly autobiographical  writings  including the captive s tale in don quixote  his two plays set in algiers  el trato de argel  the treaty of algiers  and los baños de argel  the baths of algiers   and episodes in a number of other works  in mozart s opera die entführung aus dem serail  a singspiel   two european ladies are discovered in a turkish harem  presumably captured by barbary corsairs  rossini s opera l italiana in algeri is based on the capture of several slaves by barbary corsairs led by the bey of algiers barbary corsairs were also featured in many pornographic novels  such as the lustful turk (1828),  as the abduction of white women into sexual slavery was an abiding of the stereotypical features of a pirate as portrayed in popular culture  the eye patch  may have been partially derived from the arab corsair rahmah ibn jabir al-jalahimah,  who wore a patch after losing an eye in battle in the 18th  little johnny england song   lily of barbary   tells the story of an english man who is enslaved by barbary corsairs and sold as a slave in algiers  he is freed when his master dies  he becomes a
