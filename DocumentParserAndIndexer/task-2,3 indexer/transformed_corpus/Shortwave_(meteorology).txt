 a shortwave or shortwave trough is an embedded kink in the trough   ridge pattern  its length scale is much smaller than that of longwaves  which are responsible for the largest scale  synoptic scale  weather systems  shortwaves may be contained within or found ahead of longwaves and range from the mesoscale to the synoptic scale  shortwaves are most frequently caused by either a cold pool or an upper level front shortwaves are often associated with warm air advection  waa  or cold air advection  caa   which influence temperature  due to the way they move the air around them and the way air moves away from them  shortwaves produce positive curvature vorticity and positive shear vorticity  respectively  ahead of a shortwave there is large-scale  lift due to divergence from positive vorticity advection  pva   this lift often causes precipitation  in a capped environment  the lift generated by a shortwave may cool the inversion layer as a result of the rapid expansion of the air  adiabatic cooling   allowing for deep  moist convection
