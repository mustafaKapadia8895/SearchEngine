 the solutrean hypothesis about the settlement of the americas claims that people from europe may have been among the earliest settlers of the its notable recent proponents include dennis stanford of the smithsonian institution and bruce bradley of the university of this hypothesis contrasts with the mainstream archaeological orthodoxy that the north american continent was first populated by people from asia  either by the bering land bridge  i e  beringia  at least 13,500  years or by maritime travel along the pacific coast  or by both according to the solutrean hypothesis  people of the solutrean culture  21,000  to 17,000  years in ice age europe migrated to north america by boat along the pack ice of the north atlantic ocean  they brought their methods of making stone tools with them and provided the basis for the later  c  13,000  years ago  clovis technology that spread throughout north america  the hypothesis is based on similarities between european solutrean and clovis lithic technologies supporters of the solutrean hypothesis refer to recent archaeological finds such as those at cactus hill in virginia  meadowcroft rockshelter in pennsylvania  and miles point in maryland as evidence of a transitional phase between solutrean lithic technology and what later became clovis technology in 2009,  anthropologist david j  meltzer criticized the hypothesis  stating   few if any archaeologists—or  for that matter  geneticists  linguists  or physical anthropologists—take seriously the idea of a solutrean colonization of culture was based in present-day  france  spain and portugal  from roughly 21,000  to 17,000  years ago  the manufacture of stone tools from this period is distinguished by bifacial  percussion and pressure-flaked  points  the solutrean toolmaking industry disappeared from europe around 17,000  years ago  replaced by the lithic technology of the magdalenian needed clovis tools are characterized by a distinctive type of spear point  known as the clovis point  solutrean and clovis points do have common traits  the points are thin and bifacial  and both use the  outrepassé   or overshot flaking technique  that quickly reduces the thickness of a biface without reducing its needed  the clovis point differs from the solutrean in that some of the former have bifacial fluting  referring to the long groove carved into the bottom edge of a point to help attach it to the head of a spear  bifacial fluting describes blades on which this feature appears on both its sides clovis toolmaking technology appears in the archaeological record in much of north america between 12,800  and 13,500  years ago  older blades with this attribute have yet to be discovered from sites in either asia or solutrean hypothesis theorizes that ice age europeans may have crossed the north atlantic ocean along the edge of pack ice that extended from the atlantic coast of france to north america during the last glacial maximum  the model postulates early inhabitants may have made the crossing in small boats  using skills similar to those of the modern inuit people  hauling out on ice floes at night  collecting fresh water from melting icebergs or the first-frozen  parts of sea ice  hunting seals and fish for food  and using seal blubber as heating fuel  among other evidence  they cite the discovery in the solutrean toolkit of bone needles used for sewing waterproof clothing from animal hides similar to those still in use among modern of the solutrean hypothesis had pointed to the presence of haplogroup x  the global distribution of which is strongest in anatolia and the northeast of america  a pattern they argue is consistent with their position  michael brown in a 1998  article identified this as evidence of a possible caucasian founder population of early americans spreading from the northeast a 2008  article in the american journal of human genetics by researchers in brazil took up the argument against the solutrean hypothesis   our results strongly support the hypothesis that haplogroup x  together with the other four main mtdna haplogroups  was part of the gene pool of a single native american founding population  therefore they do not support models that propose haplogroup-independent  migrations  such as the migration from europe posed by the solutrean article in the january 2012  issue of the american journal of physical anthropology tends to argue against the solutrean theory on genetic grounds  researchers in italy argued that the distinctively asian c4c  and the disputed x2a  had  parallel genetic histories   the abstract of that article also states that similarities in ages and geographical distributions for c4c  and the previously analyzed x2a  lineage provide support to the scenario of a dual origin for paleo-indians.  taking into account that c4c  is deeply rooted in the asian portion of the mtdna phylogeny and is indubitably of asian origin  the finding that c4c  and x2a  are characterized by parallel genetic histories definitively dismisses the controversial hypothesis of an atlantic glacial entry route into north 2014  genetic analysis published in the journal nature reported that the dna from a 24,000-year-old  skeleton excavated in central siberia provided mitochondrial  y chromosomal  and autosomal genetic evidence that suggests 14  to 38%  of native american ancestry originates from an ancient western eurasian population  the mal ta era skeleton s mitochondrial genome belonged to mtdna haplogroup u  which has also been found at high frequencies among mesolithic european hunter-gatherers.  the authors state that their findings have four implications  the third being that  such an easterly presence in asia of a population related to contemporary western eurasians provides a possibility that non-east  asian cranial characteristics of the first americans derived from the old world via migration through beringia  rather than by a trans-atlantic  voyage from iberia as proposed by the solutrean boy had ydna haplogroup r1*,  which is common to both europeans and native americans  haplogroup r1  (y-dna)  is the second most predominant y haplotype found among indigenous amerindians after q the distribution of r1  is believed associated with the re-settlement  of eurasia following the last glacial maximum  one theory put forth is that it entered the americas with the initial founding a second theory is that it was introduced during european r1  is very common throughout all of eurasia except east asia and southeast asia  r1  (m173)  is found predominantly in north american groups like the ojibwe (79%),  chipewyan (62%),  seminole (50%),  cherokee (47%),  dogrib (40%)  and tohono o odham  papago  2014,  the autosomal dna of a 12,500+-year-old  infant from montana was the dna was taken from a skeleton referred to as anzick-1,  found in close association with several clovis artifacts  comparisons showed strong affinities with dna from siberian sites  and the report stated that  in agreement with previous archaeological and genetic studies our genome analysis refutes the possibility that clovis originated via a european  solutrean  migration to the americas   the dna also showed strong affinities with all existing native american populations  which indicated that all of them derive from an ancient population that lived in or near siberia  the upper palaeolithic mal ta anzick-1  y-haplogroup  is q a 2015  report re-evaluated  the dna evidence  stating the possibility that evidence might be uncovered that supports a trans-atlantic  migration  they state that "x2a  has not been found anywhere in eurasia  and phylogeography gives us no compelling reason to think it is more likely to come from europe than from siberia  furthermore  analysis of the complete genome of kennewick man  who belongs to the most basal lineage of x2a  yet identified  gives no indication of recent european ancestry and moves the location of the deepest branch of x2a  to the west coast  consistent with x2a  belonging to the same ancestral population as the other founder mitochondrial haplogroups  nor have any high-resolution  studies of genome-wide  data from native american populations yielded any evidence of pleistocene european ancestry or trans-atlantic  gene solutrean hypothesis is challenged by large gaps in time between the clovis and solutrean eras  a lack of evidence of solutrean seafaring  lack of specific solutrean features and tools in clovis technology  the difficulties of the route and other j  jelinek  an anthropologist who took note of similarities between solutrean and clovis styles in a 1971  study  observed that the great geographical and temporal separation of the two cultures made a direct connection unlikely  since the dates of the proposed transitional sites and the solutrean period in europe only overlap at the extremes  he also argued that crossing the atlantic with the means available at the time would have been difficult  if not impossible  the opinion is shared by lawrence g  straus  who wrote that  there are no representations of boats and no evidence whatsoever either of seafaring or of the ability to make a living mainly or solely from the ocean during the straus excavated solutrean artifacts along what is now a coastline in cantabria  which was some ways inland during the solutrean epoch  he found seashells and estuarine fish at the sites  but no evidence that deep sea resources had been exploited  advocates state that the historic coastlines of western europe and eastern north america during the last glacial maximum are now under water and thus  evidence of solutrean-era  seafaring may have been obliterated or submerged another challenge to the hypothesis involves the paucity of non-technological  evidence of a kind we would expect to find transmitted from east to west  cave paintings of a kind associated with the cave of altamira in spain  for instance  are without close parallel in the new in response  bradley and stanford contend that it was  a very specific subset of the solutrean who formed the parent group that adapted to a maritime environment and eventually made it across the north atlantic ice-front  to colonize the east coast of the americas  and that this group may not have exhibited the full range of solutrean cultural a carved piece of bone depicting a mammoth found near the vero man site in florida was dated between 20,000–13,000  bp  it is described as possibly being the oldest art object yet found in the americas and may yet provide hope for the solutrean art historian barbara olins has compared the vero carving to "franco-cantabrian"  drawings and engravings of mammoths  she notes that the san of southern africa developed a realistic manner of representing animals similar to the "franco-cantabrian"  style  hinting that such a style could have evolved in north america 2008  study of relevant oceanographic data from the time period in question  co-authored  by kieran westley and justin dix  concluded  however  that  it is clear from the paleoceanographic and paleo-environmental  data that the last glacial maximum  lgm  in the north atlantic does not fit the descriptions provided by the proponents of the solutrean atlantic hypothesis  although ice use and sea mammal hunting may have been important in other contexts  in this instance  the conditions militate against an ice-edge-following,  maritime-adapted  european population reaching the relying on the location of the ice shelf at the time of the putative atlantic crossing  they are skeptical that a transoceanic voyage to north america  even allowing for the judicious use of glaciers and ice floes as temporary stopping points and sources of fresh water  would have been feasible for people from the solutrean era the 2012  book across atlantic ice  the origin of america s clovis culture critically evaluate the evidence presented in stanford and bradley s book  and find it unconvincing  the radiocarbon dates from purported pre-clovis  archaeological sites presented by stanford and bradley are consistently earlier in north america—predating solutrean culture in europe by 5–10  thousand expands upon and revises earlier formulations of the solutrean hypothesis  the book received significant media attention but mixed reviews from professional archaeologists  o brien and 1970  a stone tool  a biface hand axe  which was later suggested by stanford and bailey to resemble solutrean stone tools was dredged up by the trawler cinmar off the east coast of virginia in an area that would have been dry land prior to the rising sea levels of the pleistocene epoch  the tool was allegedly found in the same dredge load that contained a mastodon s remains  the mastodon tusks were later dated at 22,000  years in addition several archaeological sites on the delmarva peninsula with suggestive  but not definitive  dating between 16,000  and 18,000  years have been discovered by darrin lowery of the university of delaware  these factors led stanford and bradley to reiterate in 2014  their academic advocacy of pre-clovis  peoples in north america and their possible link to paleolithic are two basic points of contention concerning the cinmar biface  one is whether its association with the mastodon remains is meaningful  and the other relates to the statement by stanford and bradley that the biface is pre-late  glacial maximum  lgm  and could not be late prehistoric  stating that they rejected that possibility  through an extensive evaluation of collections from the eastern seaboard in which no similar bifaces were identified from any post-lgm  a report in the january 2015  issue of american antiquity reviewed the literature and concluded  that the dual claims that such point forms are both rare and do not date to post-lgm  contexts cannot be the same report also examined the 13  artifacts claimed to be older than 22,000  bp  finding they were  indistinguishable from visually identical bipoints from holocene contexts across the eastern seaboard   and concluding   the widespread distribution of these points  their well-established  chronological and culture-historical  associations  and the reported association with marine/deep-sea  exploitation leads us to conclude that there is no reason to consider bi-points  from the delmarva peninsula  new england  the continental shelf—or indeed anywhere in eastern north america—as necessarily derived from solutrean culture or as necessarily being  older than clovis  much less a distinct pre-clovis   cultural pattern     collins et al
