 the 2007  atlantic hurricane season was an active atlantic hurricane season  although most of the storms were weak and short-lived.  despite the high activity of weak storms during 2007,  it was the first season to feature more than one category 5  landfalling hurricane  a feat that would not be matched until 2017.  it produced 17  tropical cyclones  15  tropical storms  six hurricanes  and two major hurricanes  it officially started on june 1  and ended on november 30,  dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the atlantic ocean  the first tropical cyclone  subtropical storm andrea  developed on may 9,  while the last storm  tropical storm olga  dissipated on december 13.  the most intense hurricane  dean  is tied for the eighth most intense atlantic hurricane ever recorded as well as the third most intense atlantic hurricane at landfall  the season was one of only six on record for the atlantic with more than one category 5  hurricane  it was the second on record in which an atlantic hurricane  felix  and an eastern pacific hurricane  henriette  made landfall on the same day  september had a record-tying  eight storms  although the strengths and durations of most of the storms were low  aside from hurricanes dean and felix  none of the storms in the season exceeded category 1  intensity.pre-season  forecasts by colorado state university called for 14  named storms and 7  hurricanes  of which three were expected to attain major hurricane status  the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa  later issued its initial forecast  which predicted 13  to 17  named storms  7  to 10  hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes  after several revisions in the projected number of storms  noaa and csu lowered their forecasts by the middle of the season several storms made landfall or directly affected land  hurricanes dean and felix made landfall at category 5  intensity  causing severe damage in parts of mexico and central america  respectively  both storm names  as well as noel  the name of a hurricane that affected the caribbean  were retired from the naming list of atlantic hurricanes  the united states was affected by five cyclones  although the storms were generally weak  three tropical depressions and only two tropical storms  barry and gabrielle  and one hurricane  humberto  made landfall in the country  elsewhere  three storms directly affected canada  although none severely  the combined storms killed at least 423  people and caused about $3  billion (2007  usd  $3.47  billion 2017  usd  in 1]noted  hurricane experts philip j  klotzbach  william m  gray  and their associates at colorado state university issue forecasts of hurricane activity each year  separately from noaa  klotzbach s team  formerly led by gray  determined the average number of storms per season between 1950  and 2000  to be 9.6  tropical storms  5.9  hurricanes  and 2.3  major hurricanes  storms exceeding category 3  on the saffir-simpson  hurricane a normal season  as defined by noaa  has 9  to 12  named storms  of which five to seven reach hurricane strength and one to three become major december 8,  2006,  klotzbach s team issued its first extended-range  forecast for the 2007  season  predicting above-average  activity (14  named storms  seven hurricanes  three of category 3  or it listed a 64  percent chance of at least one major hurricane striking the u s  mainland  this included a 40  percent chance of at least one major hurricane strike on the east coast  including the florida peninsula  and a 40  percent chance of at least one such strike on the gulf coast from the florida panhandle westward  the potential for major hurricane activity in the caribbean was forecast to be above average  and the team predicted that el niño  associated with reduced hurricane activity in the atlantic  would dissipate by the active portion of the april 3  a new forecast was issued  calling for a very active hurricane season of 17  named storms  nine hurricanes and five intense the increase in the forecast was attributed to the rapid dissipation of el niño conditions  the team also forecast a neutral or weak-to-moderate  la niña and noted that sea surface temperatures were much higher than the estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect the u s  was increased to 74  percent  the east coast potential increased to 50  percent  and from the florida panhandle westward to brownsville  texas  the probability rose to 49  however  the team s report noted that while they predicted an active season  it was not suggesting that 2007  would be  as active as the 2004  and 2005  june 19  the uk met office  ukmo  issued a forecast of 10  tropical storms in the july to november period with a 70  percent chance that the number would be in the range of 7  to on august 3,  2007,  klotzbach s team lowered its season estimate to 15  named storms  of which eight were to become hurricanes and four to become major hurricanes  team members noted that conditions had become slightly less favorable for storms than earlier in the year  sea surface temperature anomalies were cooler  and several saharan air layer events had suppressed development of tropical cyclones  el niño-southern  oscillation  enso  conditions were also noted to have been slightly august 9,  2007,  noaa revised its season estimate slightly downwards to 13  to 16  named storms of which seven to nine were to be hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes  however  the agency reaffirmed its prediction of an above-average  season  citing warmer-than-normal  sea surface temperatures in parts of the atlantic ocean and caribbean sea and the likelihood of la niña conditions during the peak of the the season s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy  ace  rating of 74,  which is below the long-term  average of ace is  broadly speaking  a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed  so storms that last a long time  as well as particularly strong hurricanes  have high aces  ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34  knots (39  mph  63  km h  or tropical storm strength  although officially  subtropical cyclones  such as andrea or the initial portions of gabrielle  jerry  and olga  are excluded from the the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase only two major hurricanes—storms of category 3  intensity or higher—formed during the season  the least since the 1997  season  although tied with the 2006  and 2002  seasons  named storms were active for 33.50  days during the season  the lowest number of active days since the 1994  season  there were only 11.25  days with active hurricanes  the lowest value since the 2002  season  despite this  the number of days with major hurricanes was above the long-term  average  four named storms made landfall on the u s  during the year  but damage from those storms totaled to only about $82  million (2007  usd   this was the least damage the u s  saw from any atlantic hurricane season since the 1990  the season was one of only six atlantic hurricane seasons to produce two category 5  equivalent hurricanes  the others being the 1932,  1933,  1961,  2005,  and 2017  seasons  the two category 5  hurricanes  dean and felix  both reached category 5  strength on two separate occasions  and both made landfall at category 5  intensity  making the 2007  season the first to feature two hurricanes doing each  both of which would not be repeated until 2017.  when hurricane felix was upgraded to a category 5  storm on september 2,  it became the eighth to form in this basin since 2000.  this gave the decade more hurricanes of such strength than any other on tropical depression fourteen was upgraded to tropical storm melissa on september 29,  it was the eighth named storm to form in the month of september  that tied a record for the most storms during september  which was first set in hurricane humberto was the first hurricane to make landfall in texas since hurricane claudette in first storm of the season  subtropical storm andrea  originated from a large extratropical cyclone that formed off the mid-atlantic  coast on may 6.  it deepened steadily along a cold front that pushed through florida  when the system lost most of its baroclinic support  development ceased until its low moved into warmer waters near the bahamas  however  interaction between the low and a strong high-pressure  system to the north generated hurricane-force  winds in the system  decreasing vertical wind shear allowed the storm to generate deeper convection much closer to the by may 9  the previously extratropical cyclone had transformed into subtropical storm andrea while located about 140  miles (225  km  southeast of savannah  andrea began its subtropical phase as it was weakening  and continued this deterioration as it moved southward into an environment with higher wind shear  by may 11,  andrea had lost all significant convection and degenerated into a remnant low  though it produced intermittent bursts of convection  andrea s chance of regeneration was extinguished when an advancing cold front pushed it northward and eventually absorbed the was short-lived,  dissipating on may 11.  it was the first pre-season  storm to develop since tropical storm ana in april 2003  and the first atlantic named storm in may since tropical storm arlene in 1981.  six people drowned along the southeast u s  however  because andrea never made landfall  most of the resulting damage was associated with large waves  higher than normal tides  associated coastal flooding  and beach erosion caused by the june 1,  tropical storm barry developed on the first day of the hurricane season  it originated from a trough of low pressure in the southeastern gulf of mexico that previously formed in the northwestern caribbean  it accelerated to the northeast before reaching a peak intensity of 997  mbar and making landfall on barry dissipated on june in florida  the rainfall resulted in slick roads  which caused two traffic-related  deaths  and a woman was killed after being injured by rough area of low pressure formed near the bahamas on july 28  and gradually began to organize while moving north-northeast.  on july 30  it was classified as tropical depression three and was named tropical storm chantal shortly thereafter while south of nova scotia  the storm weakened on august 1  and made landfall on newfoundland  it later tracked into the north atlantic as an extratropical moved over the avalon peninsula of newfoundland where flooding was where about 4  inches (100  mm  of rain caused the postponement of the annual royal st  john s insured damage across the area totaled $5.8  million (2007  cad  $5.5  million 2007  usd  $6.35  million 2017  august 11,  a tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa  and  encountering favorable conditions  quickly spawned tropical depression four  roughly 520  miles (835  km  west-southwest  of cape the depression moved briskly westward  south of a deep layered and was upgraded to tropical storm dean on august the storm continued to strengthen overnight as it gained and became the first hurricane of the season on august on august 17  the eye of the hurricane passed into the caribbean between the islands of martinique and saint lucia as a category 2  the warm waters of the caribbean  dean rapidly strengthened into a category 5  hurricane with 165  mph (266  km h  sustained winds  this made it the strongest atlantic hurricane since hurricane wilma—and it was tied for the seventh most intense atlantic storm of all time  an eyewall replacement cycle weakened dean  which then passed just south of jamaica as a category 4  hurricane  dean regained category 5  status late on august 20  and at that strength it made landfall on the yucatán peninsula of mexico near costa maya on august hurricane dean was the first storm to make landfall as a category 5  hurricane in the atlantic basin since hurricane andrew in 1992.  a dropsonde in the eye of the storm estimated a central pressure of 905  mbar  tying dean with hurricanes camille and mitch for the seventh most intense atlantic hurricane ever recorded  dean was the third most intense landfalling atlantic storm in history  after the labor day hurricane of 1935  and hurricane gilbert of dean weakened over land  but re-intensified  slightly in the gulf of mexico  it made its final landfall near tecolutla  veracruz on august 22,  dissipating the next hispaniola  dean killed 15  people and destroyed hundreds of dean also left $616  million (2007  usd  $711  million 2017  usd  in damage on martinique and $154  million (2007  usd  $178  million 2017  usd  on in mexico  hurricane dean made landfall on the yucatán peninsula on august 21  as a category 5  throughout its track  dean killed 44  and caused several billion dollars in storm erin formed on august 16  in the gulf of mexico from a persistent area of based on reconnaissance data received from an noaa plane investigating the depression  it was upgraded to tropical storm erin on august it weakened to a tropical depression as it made landfall near lamar  texas  on august and the nhc issued its last advisory on the system shortly thereafter as it moved early on august 19  after entering oklahoma  the remnants of erin suddenly re-intensified  to maximum sustained winds of 60  mph (95  km h  a short distance west of oklahoma storm flooded more than 40  homes and businesses  along its path into the central states  erin killed 16  people—9  directly—and left about $25  million (2007  usd  $28.9  million 2017  usd  in total area of disturbed weather east of the windward islands was designated tropical depression six on august 31.  early on september 1,  it was named tropical storm felix  and it was upgraded to a hurricane later that day  tracking generally westward  it rapidly intensified to category 5,  and after fluctuating in strength  made landfall on nicaragua with 160  mph (260  km h  winds  at least 133  deaths and more than $50  million (2007  usd  in damage have been attributed to with felix  the 2007  atlantic hurricane season became the first known to include two hurricanes making landfall at category hurricanes irma and maria made landfall at category 5  intensity during the 2017  atlantic season hurricane felix took a similar path as hurricane dean though a bit further south  although its effects were not severe  damage on tobago was estimated at $250,000  (2007  ttd  $40,000  2007  usd  $46.2  thousand 2017  hurricane felix made landfall just south of the border between nicaragua and honduras  in a region historically known as the mosquito coast  as a category 5  hurricane with 160  mph (260  km h  winds on september residents of the region were reported to have been given little warning of the oncoming hurricane  which left many fisherman stranded at in all  felix killed at least 130  and damage in nicaragua totaled c$869.3  million (2007  nio  $46.7  million 2007  usd  $53.9  thousand 2017  cold front that moved off the southeastern coast of the united states on september 1  developed a weak low over the waters near georgia  the low drifted eastward and weakened over the next few days until it joined with convection from an upper-level  trough that had been moving over the western on september 8,  the center of circulation became sufficiently organized to be declared subtropical storm gabrielle  about 360  nautical miles (670  km  southeast of cape for the next twelve hours  the system s strongest winds and thunderstorms remained separated from the center  on september 8  new convection eventually united with the center  leading the transition of gabrielle into a tropical storm  gabrielle gradually strengthened as it traveled northwest towards north carolina and virginia  the storm reached its peak intensity of 60  mph (95  km h  just before it arrived in cape lookout  though strong wind shear kept most of the convection and surface winds gabrielle weakened over land  and moved back into the atlantic on september 10.  the circulation deteriorated further  and the storm dissipated southwest of nova scotia the next advance of the storm  tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for coastal while rescue teams and the u s  coast guard were put on the storm dropped heavy rainfall near its immediate landfall location but little precipitation elsewhere  along the coast  high waves  rip currents  and storm surge were reported  slight localized flooding was reported  gusty winds also occurred  though no wind damage was reported  overall damage was minor  and there were no large tropical wave exited africa on september 6  and initially failed to develop due to strong easterly shear  on september 9,  a broad low pressure area developed about midway between africa and the lesser the wind shear slowly weakened  and early on september 12  tropical depression eight developed about 1125  miles (1815  km  east of the lesser antilles  the system moved west-northwestward  due to a ridge to its north  and with continued wind shear  it remained a tropical depression for 24  hours before convection increased further  early on september 13  it intensified into tropical storm ingrid  reaching peak winds of 45  mph (75  operationally  it was not upgraded to a tropical storm until that remained a tropical storm until september 15,  when it weakened to a tropical depression due to high shear from a strong tropical upper tropospheric gradual weakening continued as it passed northeast of the leeward ingrid briefly reorganized on september before weakening further and degenerating into an open wave early on september the remnants turned northwestward within the low-level  steering flow  and dissipated on september 18  without redevelopment  there were no reports of damage or casualties associated with ingrid because the storm never threatened september 12,  an area of thunderstorm activity in the gulf of mexico organized into tropical depression nine  about 60  mi (97  km  southeast of matagorda  texas  within three hours of forming  it was named tropical storm humberto  and it turned to the north-northeast  before rapidly in the early morning hours of september 13,  a hurricane hunter aircraft found that humberto had strengthened into a hurricane while located about 15  miles (20  km  off the coast of humberto quickly weakened and entered southwest louisiana as a tropical storm during the afternoon of september dissipating the next humberto caused some structural damage on high island and widespread tree and power line damage in the beaumont-port  arthur power outages caused four oil refineries to halt production in beaumont  one person was reported dead as a result of the storm  a bridge city man killed when his carport crashed on him outside his house  damage was estimated at $50  subtropical depression formed on september 21  in the northeastern gulf of mexico from the interaction of a tropical wave  the tail end of a cold front  and an upper-level  low  initially containing a poorly defined circulation and intermittent thunderstorm activity  the system transitioned into a tropical depression after convection increased over the center  tracking northwestward  the depression moved ashore near fort walton beach early on september 22,  and shortly thereafter it dissipated over southeastern was the first tropical cyclone to threaten the new orleans area after the destructive 2005  hurricane season and hurricane overall impact from the cyclone was minor and largely limited to light however  the precursor system spawned a damaging tornado in eustis  florida  where 20  houses were destroyed and 30  more were damage was estimated at $6.2  origins of jerry were from a non-tropical  low pressure area over the central atlantic on september 21.  the system meandered for two days  gradually developing deeper convection and gaining organization  on september 23,  the national hurricane center declared it a subtropical depression  as a warm core had developed but the system was still involved with an upper-level  low  and its strongest winds were well removed from the early on september 23,  both satellite estimates and quikscat data determined that the depression had strengthened into subtropical storm jerry  despite the lack of a well-defined  inner storm slowly acquired tropical characteristics including a better-defined  warm and jerry became fully tropical that evening as a weak and sheared tropical storm with 40  mph (65  km h  winds over a small it accelerated northeastward over cooler waters with sea surface temperatures below 75  °f (24  on september 24,  it weakened to a tropical depression ahead of a powerful cold front with little deep convection remaining in the that evening  a quikscat pass determined that jerry opened up into a trough  which was being absorbed into the larger frontal it completely dissipated by early on september 25.  jerry never approached land during its lifespan  and no damage or casualties were very large tropical wave accompanied by a large envelope of low pressure emerged from the coast of africa on september 21.  as it moved westward  deep convection gradually increased over the disturbance as its broad low-level  circulation became better-defined.  by september 24,  as the system traveled northwestward it organized enough to become a tropical six hours later the depression was upgraded to tropical storm organization and intensity remained steady for the next day  early on september 26,  however  the storm strengthened significantly  in post-operational  analysis the cyclone was determined to have reached hurricane-strength  for about twelve the strengthening was short-lived  because a sharp upper-level  trough to the west of karen increased the amount of vertical wind shear over the hurricane  by september 28  these unfavorable conditions had weakened karen to a marginal tropical storm and left its low-level  circulation meanwhile  the storm began heading northward and experiencing intermittent bursts of deep convection  however  the relentless wind shear exposed the system s circulation until it dissipated in the mid-atlantic  on september 29.  karen s remnants lingered near the leeward islands for the next few days  although the system never directly affected land  as a result  no reported damages or casualties were associated with tropical wave moved off the western coast of africa on september traversed the caribbean and crossed the yucatán on september 21.  the disturbance developed a small surface low on september 24  while moving erratically over the southwestern gulf of strong upper-level  winds initially prevented the system from developing convection  however  the shear relaxed on the following day and convection on the evening of september 25,  a hurricane hunter aircraft found evidence that the low qualified as a tropical under weak steering currents  the depression drifted south and southwest  executing a small cyclonic loop into the bay of campeche  upper-level  winds gave way to an anticyclone above the depression  and the system became tropical storm lorenzo on september 27  about 130  nautical miles (240  km  east of rapid intensification brought lorenzo to hurricane status early that evening  less than twelve hours after becoming a tropical storm  lorenzo reached its peak intensity on september 28,  then weakened slightly before making landfall near tecolutla  mexico as a minimal hurricane  the small circulation weakened rapidly after landfall  and the system dissipated the next deaths in mexico were attributed to lorenzo  mostly due to flash floods and mudslides  the states of puebla and veracruz reported damage from rain and high winds  two hundred people were forced to evacuate in hidalgo when the san lorenzo river overflowed its banks  lorenzo made landfall in virtually the same location that hurricane dean had struck a month damage was estimated at $1  billion (2007  mxn  $92  million 2007  usd  $106  million 2017  september 26,  a tropical wave exited africa and quickly developed a low pressure area  following a convective increase and better-defined  outflow  it developed into tropical depression fourteen about 115  miles (185  km  west-southwest  of the southernmost cape verde islands early on september because the depression was isolated from the subtropical ridge  the depression drifted westerly wind shear prevented significant but following an increase in convection  the depression intensified into tropical storm melissa early on september similar to previous storms ingrid and karen  high wind shear in the deep tropics hindered melissa s and its peak winds were only 40  mph (65  operationally  satellite imagery suggested the storm reached 45  mph (72  by september 30,  the shear and cooler waters weakened melissa to a tropical depression with a poorly defined surface the system lost its deep convection and by that afternoon  melissa degenerated into a remnant it continued west-northwestward,  producing intermittent convection  until being absorbed by a front northeast of the lesser antilles on october 5.  there were no reports of damage or area of disturbed weather extended from the northwestern caribbean sea to the western atlantic ocean on october possibly related to the remnants of hurricane the system slowly organized  developing a surface low pressure on october 8  to the northeast of the turks and caicos islands  convection associated with the storm steadily increased as the low moved towards the by october 11,  the low organized into tropical depression fifteen about 740  mi (1,190  km  east-southeast  of after the convection had persisted for about 12  hours  an upper-level  low to the west caused strong southwesterly wind shear  which inhibited october 12,  a building ridge caused the depression to slow at the same time as the convection began the storm s center became exposed as the deep convection became limited to a few small cells north of the by that afternoon  the depression degenerated into a remnant the remnant low persisted for the next several days while picking up speed and taking a gradual turn towards the northeast  the low transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on october 14  and intensified  moving through the azores with gale-force  winds  it reached winds of 50  mph (85  km h  before being absorbed by a larger extratropical storm on october the evening of october 27  a low pressure system that had been slowly developing over the eastern caribbean organization into tropical depression sixteen  the next day  it was upgraded to tropical storm noel and made landfall on haiti on october 29.  noel meandered across the western caribbean for the next three days  the storm intensified into a hurricane on november 1.  tracking northward  it began its transition into an extratropical cyclone on november 2,  becoming fully extratropical on november 4  while over labrador  as a powerful extratropical cyclone  it crossed back into the atlantic and began a track towards western the caribbean  hurricane noel caused severe damage  torrential rainfall and mudslides caused by the storm killed at least 87  people in the dominican republic and at least 73  in noel generated winds of 130  mph (210  km h  in the wreckhouse region of newfoundland and the second week of december  after the official end of the hurricane season  a low developed east of the northernmost lesser antilles  it slowly acquired tropical characteristics  and late on december 10,  the national hurricane center declared it subtropical storm olga while just north of puerto rico  it is the first post-season  storm since tropical storm zeta in the 2005  season  olga was only one of a few out of season tropical cyclones to make landfall  the storm made landfall on december 11  on the eastern tip of the dominican republic  later that evening  olga transitioned into a tropical storm just after making landfall  olga tracked over hispaniola and emerged in the caribbean sea  strong wind shear and dry air caused olga to weaken into a remnant low early on december storm impacted many areas affected by tropical storm noel a month earlier  in puerto rico  moderate rainfall caused one death  according to the national hurricane center
