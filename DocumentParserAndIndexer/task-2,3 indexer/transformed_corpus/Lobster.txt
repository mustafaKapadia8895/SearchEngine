 lobsters comprise a family  nephropidae  sometimes also homaridae  of large marine crustaceans lobsters have long bodies with muscular tails  and live in crevices or burrows on the sea floor  three of their five pairs of legs have claws  including the first pair  which are usually much larger than the others  highly prized as seafood  lobsters are economically important  and are often one of the most profitable commodities in coastal areas they commercially important species include two species of homarus  which looks more like the stereotypical lobster  from the northern atlantic ocean  and scampi  which looks more like a shrimp  or a  mini lobster   – the northern hemisphere genus nephrops and the southern hemisphere genus metanephrops  although several other groups of crustaceans have the word  lobster  in their names  the unqualified term  lobster  generally refers to the clawed lobsters of the family clawed lobsters are not closely related to spiny lobsters or slipper lobsters  which have no claws  chelae   or to squat lobsters  the closest living relatives of clawed lobsters are the reef lobsters and the three families of freshwater crayfish lobsters are invertebrates with a hard protective like most arthropods  lobsters must moult to grow  which leaves them vulnerable  during the moulting process  several species change colour  lobsters have 10  walking legs  the front three pairs bear claws  the first of which are larger than the although lobsters are largely bilaterally symmetrical like most other arthropods  some genera possess unequal  specialised claws lobster anatomy includes the cephalothorax which fuses the head and the thorax  both of which are covered by a chitinous carapace  and the abdomen  the lobster s head bears antennae  antennules  mandibles  the first and second maxillae  and the first  second  and third maxillipeds  because lobsters live in murky environments at the bottom of the ocean  they mostly use their antennae as sensors  the lobster eye has a reflective structure above a convex retina  in contrast  most complex eyes use refractive ray concentrators  lenses  and a concave the abdomen includes swimmerets and its tail is composed of uropods and the telson lobsters  like snails and spiders  have blue blood due to the presence of hemocyanin which contains in contrast  vertebrates and many other animals have red blood from iron-rich  hemoglobin  lobsters possess a green hepatopancreas  called the tomalley by chefs  which functions as the animal s liver and of the family nephropidae are similar in overall form to a number of other related groups  they differ from freshwater crayfish in lacking the joint between the last two segments of the and they differ from the reef lobsters of the family enoplometopidae in having full claws on the first three pairs of legs  rather than just the distinctions from fossil families such as the chilenophoberidae are based on the pattern of grooves on the live up to an estimated 45  to 50  years in the wild  although determining age is in 2012,  a report was published describing how growth bands in calcified regions of the eyestalk or gastric mill in shrimps  crabs and lobsters could be used to measure growth and mortality in decapod without such a technique  a lobster s age is estimated by size and other variables  this new knowledge  could help scientists better understand the population and assist regulators of the lucrative link research suggests that lobsters may not slow down  weaken or lose fertility with age  and that older lobsters may be more fertile than younger lobsters  this longevity may be due to telomerase  an enzyme that repairs long repetitive sections of dna sequences at the ends of chromosomes  referred to as telomeres  telomerase is expressed by most vertebrates during embryonic stages  but is generally absent from adult stages of however  unlike most vertebrates  lobsters express telomerase as adults through most tissue  which has been suggested to be related to their lobster longevity is limited by their size  moulting requires metabolic energy and the larger the lobster  the more energy is needed  10  to 15%  of lobsters die of exhaustion during moulting  while in older lobsters  moulting ceases and the exoskeleton degrades or collapses entirely leading to like many other decapod crustaceans  grow throughout life and are able to add new muscle cells at each lobster longevity allows them to reach impressive sizes  according to guinness world records  the largest lobster ever caught was in nova scotia  canada  weighing 20.15  kilograms (44.4  are found in all oceans  they live on rocky  sandy  or muddy bottoms from the shoreline to beyond the edge of the continental shelf  they generally live singly in crevices or in burrows under rocks lobsters are omnivores and typically eat live prey such as fish  mollusks  other crustaceans  worms  and some plant life  they scavenge if necessary  and are known to resort to cannibalism in captivity  however  when lobster skin is found in lobster stomachs  this is not necessarily evidence of cannibalism – lobsters eat their shed skin after while cannibalism was thought to be nonexistent among wild lobster populations  it was observed in 2012  by researchers studying wild lobsters in maine  these first known instances of lobster cannibalism in the wild are theorized to be attributed to a local population explosion among lobsters caused by the disappearance of many of the maine lobsters  natural general  lobsters are 25–50  cm (10–20  in  long  and move by slowly walking on the sea floor  however  when they flee  they swim backward quickly by curling and uncurling their abdomens  a speed of 5  m s (11  mph  has been this is known as the caridoid escape reaction symbiotic animals of the genus symbion  the only member of the phylum cycliophora  live exclusively on lobster gills and different species of symbion have been found on the three commercially important lobsters of the north atlantic ocean – nephrops norvegicus  homarus gammarus  and homarus recipes include lobster newberg and lobster thermidor  lobster is used in soup  bisque  lobster rolls  and cappon magro  lobster meat may be dipped in clarified butter  resulting in a heightened flavour  cooks boil or steam live lobsters  when a lobster is cooked  its shell s colour changes from blue to orange because the heat from cooking breaks down a protein called crustacyanin  which suppresses the orange hue of the chemical astaxanthin  which is also found in the to the united states food and drug administration  fda   the mean level of mercury in american lobster between 2005  and 2007  was 0.107  north america  the american lobster did not achieve popularity until the mid-19th  century  when new yorkers and bostonians developed a taste for it  and commercial lobster fisheries only flourished after the development of the lobster a custom-made  boat with open holding wells on the deck to keep the lobsters alive during prior to this time  lobster was considered a mark of poverty or as a food for indentured servants or lower members of society in maine  massachusetts  and the canadian maritimes  it has been suggested servants specified in employment agreements that they would not eat lobster more than twice per week  however there is no evidence for lobster was also commonly served in prisons  much to the displeasure of american lobster was initially deemed worthy only of being used as fertilizer or fish bait  and until well into the 20th  century  it was not viewed as more than a low-priced  canned staple lobsters are graded as new-shell,  hard-shell,  or old-shell,  and because lobsters which have recently shed their shells are the most delicate  an inverse relationship exists between the price of american lobster and its flavour  new-shell  lobsters have paper-thin  shells and a worse meat-to-shell  ratio  but the meat is very sweet  however  the lobsters are so delicate  even transport to boston almost kills them  making the market for new-shell  lobsters strictly local to the fishing towns where they are offloaded  hard-shell  lobsters with firm shells  but with less sweet meat  can survive shipping to boston  new york  and even los angeles  so they command a higher price than new-shell  lobsters  meanwhile  old-shell  lobsters  which have not shed since the previous season and have a coarser flavour  can be air-shipped  anywhere in the world and arrive alive  making them the most expensive  one seafood guide notes that an $8  lobster dinner at a restaurant overlooking fishing piers in maine is consistently delicious  while  the eighty-dollar  lobster in a three-star  paris restaurant is apt to be as much about presentation as methods are used for killing lobsters  the most common way of killing lobsters is by placing them live in boiling water  sometimes after having been placed in a freezer for a period of time  another method is to split the lobster or sever the body in half lengthwise  lobsters may also be killed or rendered insensate immediately before boiling by a stab into the brain  pithing   in the belief that this will stop suffering  however  a lobster s brain operates from not one but several ganglia and disabling only the frontal ganglion does not usually result in the boiling method is illegal in some places  such as in reggio emilia  italy  where offenders face fines up to lobsters can be killed by electrocution prior to cooking  with one device  the crustastun
