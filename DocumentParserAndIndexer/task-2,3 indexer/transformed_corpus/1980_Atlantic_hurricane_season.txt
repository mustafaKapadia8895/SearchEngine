 the 1980  atlantic hurricane season was tied with 1932,  1969,  and 1994  for most named storms in atlantic ocean during the month of november – only to be surpassed in 2001  and 2005.  the season officially began on june 1,  1980,  and lasted until november 30,  1980.  these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the atlantic ocean the season was fairly active  with fifteen tropical cyclones forming  it was the first time since the 1971  season that there were no active tropical cyclones in the atlantic basin during the month of june  the season was neutral  having neither an el niño nor a la niña  three tropical cyclones during in the atlantic ocean in 1980  were notable  hurricane allen was then the earliest category 5  hurricane on record and also devastated portions of the caribbean sea  mexico  and the united states  tropical storm hermine caused significant flooding in mexico  which resulted in at least 38  fatalities  hurricane jeanne was one of only four tropical cyclones at hurricane intensity to enter the gulf of mexico and not make landfall the atlantic hurricane season officially began on june though the first tropical depression did not develop until july 17.  during the season  15  tropical depressions formed  eight of the depressions attained tropical storm status  and eight of these attained hurricane status  two of the hurricanes further strengthened to become major only allen made landfall at hurricane strength during the season  although hurricane and tropical storms danielle and hermine also caused damage and those three cyclones collectively caused 337  deaths and $1.5  billion (1980  usd  in the last storm of the season  hurricane karl  dissipated on november only three days before the official end date of november 1980  atlantic hurricane season had a rather slow beginning  with only one tropical depression developing prior to the month of in contrast  august was an active month  with five tropical cyclones three of which became during that month  hurricane allen became the earliest known category 5  hurricane on august 5,  a record later broken by only hurricane emily on july 16,  september also had five tropical cyclones  all of which became named storms  tropical cyclogenesis abruptly halted in october  with only hurricane ivan developing in that month  however  the month of november was considered to be very active  with three storms forming during that month  two of the systems became named a record that was tied with 1932,  1969,  and 1994,  but later surpassed when three tropical storms existed in the atlantic in november 2001  and november season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy  ace  rating of which is classified as  above ace is  broadly speaking  a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed  so storms that last a long time  as well as particularly strong hurricanes  have high aces  ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34  knots (39  mph  63  km h  or tropical storm strength  although officially  subtropical cyclones are excluded from the the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase a decaying cold front entered into gulf of mexico  and developed a low-pressure  area of july 17.  later that day  the low-pressure  area developed into tropical depression one almost halfway between louisiana and the yucatan peninsula  the depression moved northwestward  and minimal intensification occurred  as it approached the gulf coast of the united states  the depression made landfall in texas near the galveston area  and dissipated by july 21.  minimal impact was recorded from the depression  and light rainfall was reported in texas and western louisiana  peaking at 3.77  in (96  mm  in refugio  a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of africa on july 30  and quickly developed into tropical depression two about two days later  by august 2,  the depression had strengthened and was upgraded to tropical storm allen  the storm steadily intensified and became a hurricane on august 3.  thereafter  allen rapidly deepened  and was a major hurricane only 24  hours later  while it was becoming a category 3  hurricane  and a category 4  hurricane  shortly after  allen passed through the windward islands  upon entering the caribbean sea  allen continued to strengthen and became a category 5  hurricane on august 5,  while about halfway between puerto rico and venezuela  allen briefly curved northwestward and approached the tiburon peninsula of haiti  shortly thereafter  allen weakened significantly on august 6,  but was still a category 4  when it bypassed jamaica  while paralleling the south coast of cuba  allen re-strengthened  into a category 5  hurricane  later that day  the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 190  mph (305  km h  and a minimum barometric pressure of 899  mbar (26.5  inhg   immediately following peak intensity  allen entered the gulf of mexico and weakened back to a category 4  hurricane on august 8.  on the day next  allen re-intensified  into a category 5  hurricane while approaching however  just offshore allen abruptly weakened to a low-end  category 3  hurricane prior to landfall near brownsville  texas on august 10.  the storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated about 36  hours after striking 500  houses were either damaged or destroyed on barbados  losses totaled to only $1.5  million (1980  having passed only 8  miles (13  km  south of st  allen produced sustained winds as high as 104  mph (167  km h  on the island  the storm caused 27  fatalities and $88  million (1980  usd  in damage on that island  in addition  one death was reported in high winds and flooding in haiti left 836,200  people homeless  in addition  220  deaths were reported and damage exceeded $400  million (1980  usd   to the east in dominican republic  effects were less severe  though seven deaths were reported and damage was estimated at $47  million (1980  usd   on the island of cuba  three fatalities occurred and losses were unknown  in northeastern mexico  heavy rainfall occurred  though damage was minimal and no fatalities were reported  damage was most significant in the united states  especially in the state of texas  in corpus christi  gravel blew off the roofs  which broke windows throughout the city  several tornadoes were spawned in texas  one of which caused $100  million (1980  usd  in damage in rainfall in the state of texas exceeded 20  inches (510  mm  in some 24  fatalities occurred in the united states – seven in texas and seventeen in louisiana – most resulting from the crash of a helicopter evacuating workers from an offshore platform  damage in united states totaled to $860  million (1980  overall  hurricane allen caused $1.5  billion (1980  usd  in losses and caused 290  third tropical depression of the season developed east of cape verde on august however  the national hurricane center did not initiate advisories until august 16.  as a result  the system was classified as tropical depression after forming on august 13,  the depression crossed through the cape verde islands  the depression tracked northwestward and strengthened minimally  with winds never exceeding 35  mph (55  km h   thereafter  the depression curved and approached the eastern portion of the azores  tropical depression four moved through the islands shortly later  by early on august 17,  the depression dissipated near santa maria island in the on august 13,  a tropical wave in the vicinity of the cape verde began organizing into a tropical cyclone  early on the following day  the system had developed into tropical depression four while nearly halfway between the west coast of africa and the windward however  in post-analysis,  it was revealed that the previous tropical depression had actually developed before bonnie  thus  those two depressions were operationally numbered two reports of gale force winds were received from ships later that day  as a result  the depression was re-classified  as tropical storm bonnie about twelve hours after developing  bonnie turned in a general northward direction  possibly due to interaction with nearby tropical depression on satellite estimates  bonnie was upgraded to a hurricane at 0000  utc on august the storm strengthened slightly further and attained its peak intensity with winds of 100  mph (155  km h  and a minimum pressure of 975  mbar (28.8  after attaining peak intensity on august 16,  bonnie slowly weakened as it continued in an unusual northward direction  on the following day  bonnie weakened slightly to a minimal category 1  the storm remained at that intensity for 72  hours as it accelerated northward across the open atlantic  by 1800  utc on august 19,  bonnie transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while almost halfway between the southern tip of greenland and the extratropical low pressure system was centered over the mid-atlantic  united states  though it tracked southeastward and emerged into the atlantic on august 20.  later that day  satellite imagery indicated that a well-defined  low-level  circulation  as a result  it was determine that the system developed into a subtropical depression at 1200  utc  while located about 150  miles (240  km  east-northeast  of hatteras  north carolina  initially  the depression tracked east-southeastward,  though it curved east-northeastward  by august 21.  shortly thereafter  the depression strengthened into a subtropical storm  by early on august 23,  the storm had intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics to be re-classified  as hurricane 1200  utc on august 23,  charley attained its peak intensity with winds of 80  mph (130  km h  and a minimum pressure of 989  mbar (29.2  inhg   following peak intensity  charley completed a cyclonic loop and began weakening as it headed almost due-east.  charley was downgraded to a tropical storm early on august 24.  the storm continued eastward and by august 26,  charley became unidentifiable as it merged with an intense extratropical cyclone  while located about 790  miles (1,270  km  southeast of cape race  while a tropical cyclone  charley produced rip currents along the outer banks of north carolina  which drowned seven tropical wave exited the west coast of africa and emerged into the atlantic ocean on august 22.  the system developed into tropical depression six  while centered to the west of cape verde at 0000  utc on august the depression tracked westward with minimal intensification  by 1800  utc on august 26,  the depression reached 35  mph (55  km h  and did not strengthen further  on the following day  the depression curved northwestward and slowly began to weaken  the depression degenerated into a tropical wave while well northeast of puerto rico on august the remnants of tropical depression six continued westward and interacted with a low-pressure  system over florida  eventually  the system developed into tropical depression eight on september 4,  which later became tropical storm august 28,  a tropical wave emerged into the atlantic off the west coast of africa  at 0000  utc on september 1,  the system developed into tropical depression seven  while centered roughly midway between the lesser antilles and the west coast of sixteen hours later  the national hurricane center initiated advisories on the the depression tracked westward in the trade winds during the following three days  without any intensification  after curving northwestward an air force reconnaissance flight found little evidence of a closed circulation  while satellite imagery also showed a disorganized and elongated cloud pattern on september as a result  it was determined that the depression degenerated into a tropical disturbance at 0600  utc on that however  the national hurricane center did not discontinue advisories until 2200  september 5,  satellite imagery suggested a surface circulation had developed  possibly due to interaction with a cold low  as a result  the system regenerated into a subtropical depression at 1200  utc on that day  while centered about 360  miles (580  km  southwest of ten hours later  the national hurricane center resumed advisories on the subtropical while the subtropical depression was curved northeastward  it strengthened and acquired tropical characteristics  at 0000  utc on september 7,  the subtropical depression became tropical storm the storm continued to intensify while tracking northeastward and was upgraded to a hurricane about 24  hours after becoming a tropical storm  simultaneously  georges attained its peak intensity with winds of 80  mph (130  km h  and a minimum pressure of 993  mbar (29.3  inhg   however  later that day  georges transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near cape race  while bypassing newfoundland  georges dropped light rainfall  with amounts under 1  inch (25  mm  of tropical wave emerged into the atlantic ocean from the west coast of africa on august 22.  the system developed into tropical depression eight on august 25.  however  the depression did not strengthen further  and about four days later  it degenerated back into a tropical tracking westward  the system crossed florida and entered into the gulf of mexico on september 2.  two days later  the system developed into tropical depression eight while offshore of louisiana  the depression gradually strengthened and became tropical storm danielle late on september 5.  after peaking with winds of 60  mph (95  km h   further intensification was halted  as danielle soon made landfall in eastern texas  danielle steadily weakened inland and dissipated two days barge in the gulf of mexico capsized due to rough seas  sending 11  of the crewmen overboard  one person drowned as a danielle produced widespread rainfall in louisiana  though few areas reported more than 5  inches (130  mm  of damage in that state was rainfall was heavier in texas  peaking at 18.29  inches (465  much of the damage caused by the storm was as a result of flooding  in port arthur  twelve homes were damaged  while interstate 10  was inundated by flood waters  one fatality occurred in texas due to an automobile accident in danielle also spawned five tornadoes in texas  three of which collectively caused $277,500  in damage (1980  outside of texas and louisiana  the storm also dropped light rainfall in oklahoma and mississippi  though minimal damage occurred in either state  overall  danielle caused two and $277,500  (1980  usd  in september 2  and september 3,  a tropical wave exited the west coast of africa and entered the atlantic ocean  satellite imagery indicated that the system had rapidly organized and was classified as a tropical depression on september 4.  the depression quickly strengthened and by early on september 2,  it was upgraded to tropical storm earl  because convection associated with the storm waxed and waned significantly  earl was operationally considered a tropical depression until september 6.  on the following day  earl curved north-northwestward  and accelerated due to an upper-level  low pressure trough in the central atlantic evidence of an eye feature appeared  earl was upgraded to a hurricane on september 8.  six hours later  the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 75  mph (120  km h  and a minimum pressure of 985  mbar (29.1  inhg   under the influence of an upper cold low  earl began re-curving  and accelerated to the northeast  by 1200  utc on september 10,  earl weakened to a tropical storm  six hours later  earl transitioned into an extratropical cyclone  while centered about halfway between the azores and strong low pressure system moved off the african coast on september 5.  by the following day  it developed into tropical depression ten while a short distance off the west coast of africa  about 18  hours later  the depression intensified into tropical storm the national hurricane center did not issue advisories until 1600  utc on september 7,  at which time the system was already a tropical by early on september 8,  frances had reached hurricane though it was not operationally upgraded until about 16  hours after becoming a hurricane  frances began to rapidly strengthen  and became a category 2  hurricane later that day  early on september 9,  the storm further intensified to a category 3  at 0600  utc on that day  frances attained its peak intensity with winds of 115  mph (185  km h  and a minimum pressure of 958  mbar (28.3  peak intensity  frances began to weaken and was downgraded to a category 2  hurricane later on september 9.  following day  the storm fluctuated between category 2  and category 1  hurricane strengthen  while curving northwestward on september 13,  frances remained steady in intensity as a category 2  hurricane  eventually  frances re-curved  northward  thereby avoiding any land  after minimal change in intensity  frances weakened to a category 1  hurricane while tracking northeastward on september 17.  after briefly heading northward  the storm re-curved  back to the early on september 20,  frances weakened to a tropical before merging with a frontal low while centered about halfway between greenland and iceland  reports of strong tropical storm force winds were received from ships  but no damage was reported except for minor squalls in cape tropical wave exited the west coast of africa on september 11  and tracked westward with minimal development until reaching the caribbean sea  by september 20,  a low-level  circulation had developed and the system was then classified as tropical depression eleven  while located almost midway between panama and jamaica  while heading almost due westward  the depression steadily intensified  becoming tropical storm hermine on september 21,  18  hours after forming  later on september 21,  the storm passed only 5  miles (8.0  km  offshore of honduras  hermine curved west-northwestward  and nearly strengthened into a hurricane before landfall in northern british honduras (present-day  belize  on september 22.  after crossing the yucatan peninsula  hermine emerged into the bay of campeche on the following again  the storm intensified to near hurricane strength  though hermine made landfall near coatzacoalcos  veracruz  mexico on september 24.  after moving inland  the storm steadily weakened while tracking south-southwestward  toward the pacific ocean  however  by early on september 26,  hermine dissipated near the southwestern coast of in mexico  many areas reported at least 10  inches (250  mm  of precipitation  while a few locations experienced more than 30  inches (760  mm  of as a result of torrential rainfall  at least 30  fatalities occurred  with dozens more and leaving 25,000  additionally  landslides triggered by hermine in guatemala killed at least eight late september  a cold-core  low persisted off the coast of portugal  moving southwestward  the system gradually developed tropical characteristics as it turned northwestward and executed a loop near the azores  eventually  the system organized enough to be designated as a tropical depression on october 4,  while just east of the azores  shortly thereafter  the depression intensified into tropical storm however  the national hurricane center did not initiate advisories on ivan until late on october ivan moved largely in tandem with the upper-level  low above it  while its southwest movement was caused by a building ridge to its late on october 5,  an eye and ivan was upgraded to a hurricane on the following de-accelerated  as the ridge to its north weakened  and 18  hours after becoming a hurricane  ivan peaked with winds of 105  mph (165  between october 6  and october 7,  ivan executed a tight loop  followed by a motion to the west-northwest.  ultimately  the intensity did not change for about 90  during that time  the eye fluctuated occasionally as the convection waxed and on october 9,  ivan turned to the north in advance of an approaching cold front and extratropical storm  while slowly weakening as it accelerated over cooler waters of the far northern atlantic ocean  by october 12,  the cold front absorbed ivan  which was about 665  miles (1,070  km  west of area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression late on november 8.  the depression slowly intensified as it tracked north-northwestward  into the northwestern caribbean sea  shortly before entering the yucatan channel  the depression had strengthened enough to be upgraded to tropical storm jeanne on november 9.  further intensification was still gradual in the gulf of mexico  though the rate of deepening accelerated as the storm began to curve westward  by november 11,  jeanne was upgraded to a hurricane while paralleling the northern coast of the yucatan peninsula  early on the following day  jeanne peaked as a 100  mph (155  km h  category 2  hurricane  thereafter  jeanne began to weaken due to dry air and was downgraded to a tropical storm 24  hours after peak intensity  the storm briefly tracked west-northwestward  and then westward  before becoming nearly stationary in the western gulf of slowly and erratically  jeanne weakened further and was downgraded to a tropical depression on november 15.  the storm curved southward and completed a cyclonic loop  before being absorbed by a cold front on november fringe effects of hurricane jeanne triggered a record-breaking  23.28  inches (591  mm  of rain at key west  florida within a 24-hour  as a result of heavy precipitation  schools were and numerous businesses were closed  flights at key west international airport were grounded  and power outages and disruptions in telephone service occurred in key in texas  high tides caused flooding along much of the coast of the state  especially in galveston  offshore  several ships were caught off guard by the late season jeanne meandered through the gulf of mexico  tropical depression fourteen developed north of panama on november 12.  steered northward by deep southerly flow southeast of jeanne  the depression oscillated in organization while tracking west-northwestward.  the cloud pattern between jeanne and the depression briefly merged  with a line of thunderstorms moving across the florida peninsula between the two systems  westerly vertical wind shear increased on the depression in the process  by november 15,  the depression reorganized its convective organization while making landfall in western cuba early on november 16.  once again  vertical wind shear increased  causing convection to detach from the center of the on november 17,  the depression was absorbed by an intense  winter type storm  that was moving across the southeastern united shortly thereafter  the remnants of the depression crossed central and north while crossing cuba  the depression dumped heavy rainfall  no other impact is known to have occurred on the the depression impact from both while tropical and a remnant system  in key west  sustained winds of 30  mph (45  km h  and gusts to 40  mph (65  km h  were across much of florida  light rainfall was reported  peaking at 4.81  inches (122  mm  in low pressure area formed along a frontal boundary near the southeastern united states  the system slowly strengthened and developed into a separate vortex  early on november 25,  it became a subtropical storm while centered about 825  miles (1,328  km  southeast of cape race  newfoundland  shortly thereafter  the storm executing a tight counterclockwise loop as it rotated within the larger cyclone  about 18  hours later  the storm intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics to be designated a hurricane  after being classified as a hurricane  karl gradually strengthened while tracking eastward  eventually attaining its peak intensity with winds of 85  mph (140  km h  and a minimum barometric pressure of 985  mbar  hpa  29.09  maintained winds of 85  mph (140  km h  for approximately 18  hours and later weakened slightly while accelerating northeastward  on november 27,  the eye of karl became ragged while passing within 230  miles (370  km  of the azores and started to show signs of deterioration  a trough over the north atlantic developed into the dominant low pressure area  causing karl to turn northward around its periphery  by november 27,  karl merged with another approaching system and was declared extratropical by november 28,  while it was centered roughly halfway between cape race  newfoundland and following names were used for named storms that formed in the north atlantic in the names not retired from this list were used again in the 1986  it was the first use for all of these names since the post-1978  naming change  except for frances  which had been used in 1961,  1968,  and names that were not assigned are marked in gray  the world meteorological organization retired one name in the spring of 1981:  it was replaced by andrew in thus  this was the only time the name allen was used for a tropical cyclone this is a table of all of
