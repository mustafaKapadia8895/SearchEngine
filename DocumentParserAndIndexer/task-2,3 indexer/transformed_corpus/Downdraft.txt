 an updraft is a small‚Äêscale current of rising air  often within a localized regions of warm or cool air will exhibit vertical movement  a mass of warm air will typically be less dense than the surrounding region  and so will rise until it reaches air that is either warmer or less dense than itself  the converse will occur for a mass of cool air  and is known as subsidence  this movement of large volumes of air  especially when regions of hot  wet air rise  can create large clouds  and is the central source of thunderstorms  drafts can also be conceived by low or high pressure regions  a low pressure region will attract air from the surrounding area  which will move towards the center and then rise  creating an updraft  a high pressure region will then attract air from the surrounding area  which will move towards the center and sink  spawning a downdraft updrafts and downdrafts  along with wind shear in general  are a major contributor to airplane crashes during takeoff and landing in a thunderstorm  extreme cases  known as downbursts and microbursts can be deadly and difficult to predict or observe  the crash of delta air lines flight 191  on its final approach before landing at dallas fort worth international airport in 1985  was presumably caused by a microburst  and prompted the federal aviation administration  faa  to research and deploy new storm detection radar stations at some of the major airports  notably the ones in the south  midwest  and northeast united states where wind shear affects air safety  downbursts can cause extensive localized damage  similar to that caused by tornadoes  downburst damage can be differentiated from that of a tornado because the resulting destruction is circular and radiates away from the center  tornado damage radiates inward  towards the center of the damage the term downdraft can also refer to a type of backdraft which occurs through chimneys which have fireplaces on the lowermost levels  such as basements  of multi-level  buildings  it involves cold air coming down the chimney due to low air pressure  and makes it hard to light fires  and can push soot and carbon monoxide into domiciles
