 indra   ˈɪndrə   sanskrit  इन्द्र  is a vedic deity in a guardian deity in and the king of the highest heaven called saudharmakalpa in his mythologies and powers are similar  though not identical to those of the indo-european  deities such as zeus  jupiter  perun  thor  and odin the vedas  indra is the king of svarga  heaven  and the devas  he is the god of lightning  thunder  storms  rains and river indra is the most referred to deity in the he is celebrated for his powers  and the one who kills the great symbolic evil  asura  named vritra who obstructs human prosperity and happiness  indra destroys vritra and his  deceiving forces   and thereby brings rains and the sunshine as the friend of his importance diminishes in the post-vedic  indian literature where he is depicted as a powerful hero but one who is getting in trouble with his drunken  hedonistic and adulterous ways  and the god who disturbs hindu monks as they meditate because he fears self-realized  human beings may become more powerful than buddhism  indra has been a popular deity  referred by many names and particularly shakra  pali  sakka   he is featured in buddhism somewhat differently than hinduism  such as being shown as less war oriented and one paying homage to the indra rules over the much sought devas realm of rebirth within the samsara doctrine of buddhist however  like the hindu texts  indra also is a subject of ridicule and reduced to a figurehead status in buddhist shown as a god that suffers rebirth and in the jainism traditions  like buddhism and hinduism  indra is the king of gods and a part of jain rebirth he is also the god who appears with his wife indrani to celebrate the auspicious moments in the life of a jain tirthankara  an iconography that suggests the king and queen of gods reverentially marking the spiritual journey of a iconography shows him wielding a lightning thunderbolt known as vajra  riding on a white elephant known as in buddhist iconography the elephant sometimes features three heads  while jaina icons sometimes show the elephant with five heads  sometimes a single elephant is shown with four symbolic indra s heavenly home is on or near mount meru  also called etymological roots of indra are unclear  and it has been a contested topic among scholars since the 19th-century,  one with many the significant proposals have been colonial era scholarship proposed that indra shares etymological roots with zend andra derived from old high german antra  or jedru of old slavonic  but max muller critiqued these proposals as later scholarship has linked vedic indra to the european aynar  the great one   abaza  ubykh and innara of hittite colarusso suggests a 1]  origin and that both the phonology and the context of indra in indian religions is best explained from indo-aryan  roots and a circassian etymology  i e  is also called śakra frequently in the vedas and in buddhism  pali  sakka   he is known in burmese as သိကြားမင်း

ancient but unclear origin  aspects of indra as a deity are cognate to other indo-european  gods  they are either thunder gods such as thor  perun  and zeus who share parts of his heroic mythologies  act as king of gods  and all are linked to  rain and the similarities between indra of hindu mythologies and of thor of nordic and germanic mythologies are significant  states max muller  both indra and thor are storm gods  with powers over lightning and thunder  both carry hammer or equivalent  for both the weapon returns to their hand after they hurl it  both are associated with bulls in the earliest layer of respective texts  both use thunder as a battle-cry,  both are heroic leaders  both protectors of mankind  both are described with legends about  milking the cloud-cows",  both are benevolent giants  gods of strength  of life  of marriage and the healing gods  both are worshipped in respective texts on mountains and in janda suggests that indra has origins in the indo-european  *trigw-welumos  rather *trigw-t-welumos]   smasher of the enclosure   of vritra  vala  and diye-snūtyos   impeller of streams   the liberated rivers  corresponding to vedic apam ajas  agitator of the brave and heroic innara or inra  which sounds like indra  is mentioned among the gods of the mitanni  a hurrian-speaking  people of hittite as a deity had a presence in northeastern asia minor  as evidenced by the inscriptions on the boghaz-köi  clay tablets dated to about 1400  bce  this tablet mentions a treaty  but its significance is in four names it includes reverentially as mi-it-ra,  u-ru-w-na,  in-da-ra  and na-sa-at-ti-ia.  these are respectively  mitra  varuna  indra and nasatya-asvin  of the vedic pantheon as revered deities  and these are also found in avestan pantheon but with indra and naonhaitya as demons  this at least suggests that indra and his fellow deities were in vogue in south asia and asia minor by about mid 2nd-millennium  is praised as the highest god in 250  hymns of the rigveda – a hindu scripture dated to have been composed sometime between 1700  and 1100  bce  he is co-praised  as the supreme in another 50  hymns  thus making him one of the most celebrated vedic he is also mentioned in ancient indo-iranian  literature  but with a major inconsistency when contrasted with the vedas  in the vedic literature  indra is a heroic god  in the avestan  ancient  pre-islamic  iranian  texts such as vd  10.9,  dk  9.3  and gbd 27.6-34.27,  indra – or accurately – is a gigantic demon who opposes 2]  in the vedic texts  indra kills the archenemy and demon vritra who threatens mankind  in the avestan texts  vritra is not is called vrtrahan-   literally   slayer of vritra demon   in the vedas  which corresponds to verethragna of the zoroastrian noun verethragna-.  according to david anthony  the old indic religion probably emerged among indo-european  immigrants in the contact zone between the zeravshan river (present-day  uzbekistan  and (present-day)  it was  a syncretic mixture of old central asian and new indo-european  which borrowed  distinctive religious beliefs and from the bactria–margiana at least 383  non-indo-european  words were borrowed from this culture  including the god indra and the ritual drink according to anthony many of the qualities of indo-iranian  god of might victory  verethraghna  were transferred to the adopted god indra  who became the central deity of the developing old indic culture  indra was the subject of 250  hymns  a quarter of the rig veda  he was associated more than any other deity with soma  a stimulant drug  perhaps derived from ephedra  probably borrowed from the bmac religion  his rise to prominence was a peculiar trait of the old indic was a prominent deity in the vedic era of a quarter of the 1,208  hymns of the rigveda mention indra  making him the most referred to deity than any these hymns present a complex picture of indra  but some aspects of indra are oft repeated  of these  the most common theme is where he as the god with thunderbolt kills the evil serpent vritra that held back rains  and thus released rains and land nourishing for example  the rigvedic hymn 1.32  dedicated to indra reads इन्द्रस्य नु वीर्याणि प्र वोचं यानि चकार प्रथमानि वज्री । अहन्नहिमन्वपस्ततर्द प्र वक्षणा अभिनत्पर्वतानाम् ॥१।।  अहन्नहिं पर्वते शिश्रियाणं त्वष्टास्मै वज्रं स्वर्यं ततक्ष । वाश्रा इव धेनवः स्यन्दमाना अञ्जः समुद्रमव जग्मुरापः ॥२।।let  me tell you the manly deeds of indra  which he first accomplished  bolt-weaponed,  he slew the serpent  opened up waters  cleft in twain the belly of mountains  ॥1।।  he slew the serpent on the mountain  with heavenly bolt made by tvastar  like lowing cattle downward sped the waters  then flowed to the ocean  hymns of rigveda declare him to be the  king that moves and moves not   the friend of mankind who holds the different tribes on earth in one interpretation by oldenberg  the hymns are referring to the snaking thunderstorm clouds that gather with bellowing winds  vritra   indra is then seen as the storm god who intervenes in these clouds with his thunderbolts  which then release the rains nourishing the parched land  crops and thus in another interpretation by hillebrandt  indra is a symbolic sun god  surya  and vritra is a symbolic winter-giant   historic mini cycles of ice age  cold  in the earliest  not the later  hymns of rigveda  the vritra is an ice-demon  of colder central asia and northern latitudes  who holds back the water  indra is the one who releases the water from the winter demon  an idea that later metamorphosed into his role as storm according to griswold  this is not a completely convincing interpretation  because indra is simultaneously a lightning god  a rain god and a river-helping  god in the vedas  further  the vritra demon that indra slew is best understood as any obstruction  whether it be clouds that refuse to release rain or mountains or snow that hold back the though indra is declared as the king of gods in some verses  there is no consistent subordination of other gods to indra  in vedic thought  all gods and goddesses are equivalent and aspects of the same eternal abstract brahman  none consistently superior  none consistently inferior  all gods obey indra  but all gods also obey varuna  vishnu  rudra and others when the situation arises  further  indra also accepts and follows the instructions of savitr indra  like all vedic deities  is a part of henotheistic theology of ancient is not a visible object of nature in the vedic texts  nor is he a personification of any object  but that agent which causes the lightning  the rains and the rivers to his myths and adventures in the vedic literature are numerous  ranging from harnessing the rains  cutting through mountains to help rivers flow  helping land becoming fertile  unleashing sun by defeating the clouds  warming the land by overcoming the winter forces  winning the light and dawn for mankind  putting milk in the cows  rejuvenating the immobile into something mobile and prosperous  and in general  he is depicted as removing any and all sorts of obstacles to human the vedic prayers to indra  states jan gonda  generally ask  produce success of this rite  throw down those who hate the materialized is often presented as the twin brother of agni  fire  – another major vedic yet  he is also presented to be the same  states max muller  as in rigvedic hymn 2.1.3,  which states   thou agni  art indra  a bull among all beings  thou art the wide-ruling  vishnu  worthy of adoration  thou art the brahman  he is also part of one of many vedic trinities as  agni  indra and surya   representing the "creator-maintainer-destroyer"  aspects of existence in hindu 3]the  ancient aitareya upanishad equates indra  along with other deities  with atman  soul  self  in the vedanta s spirit of internalization of rituals and gods  it begins with its cosmological theory in verse 1.1.1  by stating that   in the beginning  atman  verily one only  was here -  no other blinking thing whatever  he bethought himself  let me now create this soul  which the text refers to as brahman as well  then proceeds to create the worlds and beings in those worlds wherein all vedic gods and goddesses such as sun-god,  moon-god,  agni and other divinities become active cooperative organs of the the atman thereafter creates food  and thus emerges a sustainable non-sentient  universe  according to the upanishad  the eternal atman then enters each living being making the universe full of sentient beings  but these living beings fail to perceive their atman  the first one to see the atman as brahman  asserts the upanishad  said   idam adarsha or  i have seen others then called this first seer as idam-dra  or "it-seeing",  which over time came to be cryptically known as  indra   because  claims aitareya upanishad  everyone including the gods like short the passing mention of indra in this upanishad  states alain daniélou  is a symbolic folk section 3.9  of the brihadaranyaka upanishad connects indra to thunder  thunderbolt and release of in section 5.1  of the avyakta upanishad  indra is praised as he who is embodies the qualities of all post-vedic  texts  indra is depicted as an intoxicated hedonistic god  his importance declines  and he evolves into a minor deity in comparison to others in the hindu pantheon  such as shiva  vishnu  or devi  in medieval hindu texts  indra is an aspect of is depicted as the father of vali in the ramayana and arjuna in the he becomes a source of nuisance rains in the puranas  out of anger and with an intent to hurt mankind  but  krishna as an avatar of vishnu  comes to the rescue by lifting mount govardhana on his fingertip  and letting mankind shelter under the mountain till indra exhausts his anger and literature of the tamil language contains more stories about indra by various authors  in silapathikaram indra is described as maalai venkudai mannavan  மாலைவெண் குடை மன்னவன்   literally meaning indra with the pearl-garland  and white sangam literature also describes indhira vizha  festival for indra   the festival for want of rain  celebrated for one full month starting from the full moon in ootrai  later name – cittirai  and completed on the full moon in puyaazhi  vaikaasi   which coincides with buddhapurnima   it is described in the epic cilapatikaram in the hindu religion  he is married to shachi  also known as indrani or and shachi have a son  jayanta  and daughters called jayanti and devasena  goddess jayanti is the spouse of shukra  while goddess devasena marries the war-god  the brahmavaivarta indra defeats vṛtrá and releases the waters  indra asks vishvakarma to build him a palace  but ultimately decides to leave his life of luxury to become a hermit and seek wisdom  horrified  indra s wife shachi asks the priest brihaspati to change her husband s mind  he teaches indra to see the virtues of both the spiritual life and the worldly life  thus  at the end of the story  indra learns how to pursue wisdom while still fulfilling his kingly needed in rigveda  indra is described as strong willed  armed with a thunderbolt  riding a chariot may the strong heaven make thee the strong wax stronger  strong  for thou art borne by thy two strong bay horses  so  fair of cheek  with mighty chariot  mighty  uphold us  strong-willed,  thunder armed  in battle indra s weapon  which he used to kill evil vritra  is the vajra or thunderbolt  other alternate iconographic symbolism for him includes a bow  sometimes as a colorful rainbow   a sword  a net  a noose  a hook  or a the thunderbolt of indra is called the post-vedic  period  he rides a large  four-tusked  white elephant called in sculpture and relief artworks in temples  he typically sits on an elephant or is near one  when he is shown to have two  he holds the vajra and a the shatapatha brahmana and
