 ludwig van beethoven   ˈlʊdvɪɡ væn ˈbeɪˌtoʊvən    listen    ˈbeɪtˌhoʊvən   german  fan ˈbeːtˌhoˑfn̩    listen   baptised 17  december – 26  march 1827)  was a german composer and pianist  a crucial figure in the transition between the classical and romantic eras in western art music  he remains one of the most famous and influential of all composers  his best-known  compositions include 9  symphonies  5  piano concertos  1  violin concerto  32  piano sonatas  16  string quartets  his great mass the missa solemnis  and one opera  fidelio born in bonn  then the capital of the electorate of cologne and part of the holy roman empire  beethoven displayed his musical talents at an early age and was taught by his father johann van beethoven and by composer and conductor christian gottlob neefe  at the age of 21  he moved to vienna  where he began studying composition with joseph haydn and gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist  he lived in vienna until his death  by his late 20s  his hearing began to deteriorate  and by the last decade of his life he was almost completely deaf  in 1811  he gave up conducting and performing in public but continued to compose  many of his most admired works come from these last 15  years of his life beethoven was the grandson of ludwig van beethoven (1712–73),  a musician from the town of mechelen in the duchy of brabant in the flemish region of what is now belgium  who at the age of twenty moved to ludwig  he adopted the german cognate of the dutch lodewijk  was employed as a bass singer at the court of the elector of cologne  eventually rising to become  in 1761,  kapellmeister  music director  and thereafter the pre-eminent  musician in bonn  the portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained proudly displayed in his grandson s rooms as a talisman of his musical ludwig had one son  johann (1740–1792),  who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and violin lessons to supplement his johann married maria magdalena keverich in 1767;  she was the daughter of johann heinrich keverich (1701–1751),  who had been the head chef at the court of the archbishopric of was born of this marriage in bonn  there is no authentic record of the date of his birth  however  the registry of his baptism  in a catholic service at the parish of st  regius on 17  december 1770,  as children of that era were traditionally baptised the day after birth in the catholic rhine country  and it is known that beethoven s family and his teacher johann albrechtsberger celebrated his birthday on 16  december  most scholars accept 16  december 1770  as beethoven s date of of the seven children born to johann van beethoven  only ludwig  the second-born,  and two younger brothers survived infancy  kaspar anton karl was born on 8  april 1774,  and nikolaus johann  the youngest  was born on 2  october first music teacher was his father  he later had other local teachers  the court organist gilles van den eeden  d  1782),  tobias friedrich pfeiffer  a family friend  who provided keyboard tuition   and franz rovantini  a relative  who instructed him in playing the violin and from the outset his tuition regime  which began in his fifth year  was harsh and intensive  often reducing him to tears  with the involvement of the insomniac pfeiffer there were irregular late-night  sessions with the young beethoven being dragged from his bed to the beethoven s musical talent was obvious at a young age  johann  aware of leopold mozart s successes in this area  with his son wolfgang and daughter nannerl   attempted to promote his son as a child prodigy  claiming that beethoven was six  he was seven  on the posters for beethoven s first public performance in march time after 1779,  beethoven began his studies with his most important teacher in bonn  christian gottlob neefe  who was appointed the court s organist in that neefe taught beethoven composition  and by march 1783  had helped him write his first published composition  a set of keyboard variations  woo beethoven soon began working with neefe as assistant organist  at first unpaid (1781),  and then as a paid employee (1784)  of the court chapel conducted by the kapellmeister andrea luchesi  his first three piano sonatas  named  kurfürst    elector   for their dedication to the elector maximilian friedrich (1708–1784),  were published in 1783.  maximilian frederick noticed beethoven s talent early  and subsidised and encouraged the young man s musical frederick s successor as the elector of bonn was maximilian francis  the youngest son of empress maria theresa of austria  and he brought notable changes to bonn  echoing changes made in vienna by his brother joseph  he introduced reforms based on enlightenment philosophy  with increased support for education and the arts  the teenage beethoven was almost certainly influenced by these changes  he may also have been influenced at this time by ideas prominent in freemasonry  as neefe and others around beethoven were members of the local chapter of the order of the march 1787  beethoven travelled to vienna  possibly at another s expense  for the first time  apparently in the hope of studying with mozart  the details of their relationship are uncertain  including whether they actually having learned that his mother was ill  beethoven returned about two weeks after his arrival in vienna  his mother died shortly thereafter  and his father lapsed deeper into alcoholism  as a result  beethoven became responsible for the care of his two younger brothers  and spent the next five years in was introduced in these years to several people who became important in his life  franz wegeler  a young medical student  introduced him to the von breuning family  one of whose daughters wegeler eventually married   beethoven often visited the von breuning household  where he taught piano to some of the children  here he encountered german and classical literature  the von breuning family environment was less stressful than his own  which was increasingly dominated by his father s beethoven also came to the attention of count ferdinand von waldstein  who became a lifelong friend and financial 1789  beethoven obtained a legal order by which half of his father s salary was paid directly to him for support of the he also contributed further to the family s income by playing viola in the court orchestra  this familiarised beethoven with a variety of operas  including three by mozart that were performed at court in this period  he also befriended anton reicha  a flautist and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra s conductor  josef 1790  to 1792,  beethoven composed a significant number of works  none were published at the time  and most are now listed as works without opus number  that demonstrated his growing range and maturity  musicologists have identified a theme similar to those of his third symphony in a set of variations written in it was probably on neefe s recommendation that beethoven received his first commissions  the municipal leaders in bonn had commissioned cantatas to mark the occasion of the death in 1790  of franz joseph ii and the subsequent accession of leopold ii as holy roman emperor  the two emperor cantatas  woo 87,  woo 88)  beethoven scored were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s.  but they were  according to brahms  distinctively  beethoven through and through  and as such prophetic of the tragic style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical was probably first introduced to joseph haydn in late 1790,  when the latter was travelling to london and stopped in bonn around christmas a year and a half later  they met in bonn on haydn s return trip from london to vienna in july 1792,  and it is likely that arrangements were made at that time for beethoven to study with the old the elector s help  beethoven left bonn for vienna in november 1792,  amid rumours of war spilling out of france  he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had mozart had also recently died  count waldstein  in his farewell note to beethoven  wrote   through uninterrupted diligence you will receive mozart s spirit through haydn s over the next few years  beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased mozart by studying that master s work and writing works with a distinctly mozartean did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer  but rather devoted himself to study and performance  working under haydn s he sought to master counterpoint  he also studied violin under ignaz early in this period  he also began receiving occasional instruction from antonio salieri  primarily in italian vocal composition style  this relationship persisted until at least 1802,  and possibly with haydn s departure for england in 1794,  beethoven was expected by the elector to return home  he chose instead to remain in vienna  continuing his instruction in counterpoint with johann albrechtsberger and other teachers  although his stipend from the elector expired  a number of viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support  among them prince joseph franz lobkowitz  prince karl lichnowsky  and baron gottfried van 1793,  beethoven had established a reputation as an improviser in the salons of the nobility  often playing the preludes and fugues of j  s  bach s well-tempered  his friend nikolaus simrock had begun publishing his compositions  the first are believed to be a set of variations  woo by 1793,  he had established a reputation in vienna as a piano virtuoso  but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their publication in 1795  would have greater beethoven s first public performance in vienna was in march 1795,  a concert in which he first performed one of his piano concertos  it is uncertain whether this was the first or second  documentary evidence is unclear  and both concertos were in a similar state of near-completion   neither was completed or published for several shortly after this performance  he arranged for the publication of the first of his compositions to which he assigned an opus number  the three piano trios  opus 1.  these works were dedicated to his patron prince and were a financial success  beethoven s profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a composed his first six string quartets  op  18)  between 1798  and 1800   commissioned by  and dedicated to  prince lobkowitz   they were published in 1801.  with premieres of his first and second symphonies in 1800  and 1803,  beethoven became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following haydn and mozart  he also continued to write in other forms  turning out widely known piano sonatas like the  pathétique  sonata  op  13),  which cooper describes as any of his previous compositions  in strength of character  depth of emotion  level of originality  and ingenuity of motivic and tonal he also completed his septet  op  20)  in 1799,  which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime for the premiere of his first symphony  beethoven hired the burgtheater on 2  april 1800,  and staged an extensive programme of music  including works by haydn and mozart  as well as his septet  the first symphony  and one of his piano concertos  the latter three works all then unpublished   the concert  which the allgemeine musikalische zeitung described as  the most interesting concert in a long time   was not without difficulties  among the criticisms was that  the players did not bother to pay any attention to the and haydn were undeniable influences  for example  beethoven s quintet for piano and winds is said to bear a strong resemblance to mozart s work for the same configuration  albeit with his own distinctive but beethoven s melodies  musical development  use of modulation and texture  and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences  and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first by the end of 1800,  beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and may 1799,  beethoven taught piano to the daughters of hungarian countess anna brunsvik  during this time  beethoven fell in love with the younger daughter who has therefore been identified as one of the more likely candidates for the addressee of his letter to the  immortal beloved   in 1812).  shortly after these lessons  josephine was married to count josef deym  beethoven was a regular visitor at their house  continuing to teach josephine  and playing at parties and concerts  her marriage was by all accounts happy  despite initial financial and the couple had four children  her relationship with beethoven intensified after deym died suddenly in had few other students  from 1801  to 1805,  he tutored ferdinand ries  who went on to become a composer and later wrote beethoven remembered  a book about their encounters  the young carl czerny studied with beethoven from 1801  to 1803.  czerny went on to become a renowned music teacher himself  instructing franz liszt  and gave on 11  february 1812  the vienna premiere of beethoven s fifth piano concerto  the compositions between 1800  and 1802  were dominated by two large-scale  orchestral works  although he continued to produce other important works such as the piano sonata sonata quasi una fantasia known as the  moonlight sonata   in the spring of 1801  he completed the creatures of prometheus  a ballet  the work received numerous performances in 1801  and 1802,  and beethoven rushed to publish a piano arrangement to capitalise on its early in the spring of 1802  he completed the second symphony  intended for performance at a concert that was cancelled  the symphony received its premiere instead at a subscription concert in april 1803  at the theater an der wien  where beethoven had been appointed composer in residence  in addition to the second symphony  the concert also featured the first symphony  the third piano concerto  and the oratorio christ on the mount of olives  reviews were mixed  but the concert was a financial success  beethoven was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802  when his brother kaspar  who had previously assisted him casually  began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs  in addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works  kaspar also began selling some of beethoven s earlier unpublished works  and encouraged beethoven  against the latter s preference  to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations  beethoven acceded to these requests  as he could not prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his is reported to have dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798  induced by a rage at the interruption of his work—having fallen over  he got up to find himself deaf  his hearing only ever partially recovered and  during its gradual decline  was impeded by a severe form of as early as 1801,  he wrote to friends describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings  although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the cause of beethoven s deafness is unknown  but has variously been attributed to typhus  auto-immune  disorders  such as systemic lupus erythematosus   and even his habit of immersing his head in cold water to stay the explanation from beethoven s autopsy was that he had a  distended inner ear   which developed lesions over needed beethoven  on the advice of his doctor  lived in the small austrian town of heiligenstadt  just outside vienna  from april to october 1802  in an attempt to come to terms with his condition  there he wrote his heiligenstadt testament  a letter to his brothers which records his thoughts of suicide due to his growing deafness and records his resolution to continue living for and through his over time  his hearing loss became profound  at the end of the premiere of his ninth symphony in 1824,  he had to be turned around to see the tumultuous applause of the audience because he could hear neither it nor the orchestra  beethoven s hearing loss did not prevent him from composing music  but it made playing at concerts—a lucrative source of income—increasingly difficult  after a failed attempt in 1811  to perform his own piano concerto no  5   the  emperor    which was premiered by his student carl czerny  he never performed in public again until he directed the premiere performance of the ninth symphony in 1824,  which involved him giving cues to conductor michael large collection of beethoven s hearing aids  such as a special ear horn  can be viewed at the beethoven house museum in bonn  germany  despite his obvious distress  czerny remarked that beethoven could still hear speech and music normally until around 1814  however  by the age of 44,  beethoven was almost totally deaf  and when a group of visitors saw him play a loud arpeggio of thundering bass notes at his piano remarking   ist es nicht schön    is it not beautiful    they felt deep sympathy considering his courage and sense of humour  he lost the ability to hear higher frequencies a result of beethoven s hearing loss  his conversation books are an unusually rich written resource  used primarily in the last ten or so years of his life  his friends wrote in these books so that he could know what they were saying  and he then responded either orally or in the book  the books contain discussions about music and other matters  and give insights into beethoven s thinking  they are a source for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed  and also his perception of his relationship to art  out of a total of 400  conversation books  it has been suggested that 264  were destroyed  and others were altered  after beethoven s death by his secretary anton schindler  who wished only an idealised biography of the composer to however  theodore albrecht contests the verity of schindler s destruction of a large number of conversation beethoven earned income from publication of his works and from public performances  he also depended on the generosity of patrons for income  for whom he gave private performances and copies of works they commissioned for an exclusive period prior to their publication  some of his early patrons  including prince lobkowitz and prince lichnowsky  gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published beethoven s most important aristocratic patron was archduke rudolph  the youngest son of emperor leopold ii  who in 1803  or 1804  began to study piano and composition with beethoven  the cleric (cardinal-priest)  and the composer became friends  and their meetings continued until beethoven dedicated 14  compositions to rudolph  including the archduke trio (1811)  and missa solemnis (1823).  rudolph  in turn  dedicated one of his own compositions to beethoven  the letters beethoven wrote to rudolph are today kept at the gesellschaft der musikfreunde in another patron was count  later prince  andreas razumovsky  for whom the string quartets nos  7–9,  op  59,  rasumovsky were named in the autumn of 1808,  after having been rejected for a position at the royal theatre  beethoven received an offer from napoleon s brother jérôme bonaparte  then king of westphalia  for a well-paid  position as kapellmeister at the court in cassel  to persuade him to stay in vienna  the archduke rudolph  prince kinsky and prince lobkowitz  after receiving representations from the composer s friends  pledged to pay beethoven a pension of 4000  florins a year  only archduke rudolph paid his share of the pension on the agreed kinsky  immediately called to military duty  did not contribute and soon died after falling from his horse  lobkowitz stopped paying in september 1811.  no successors came forward to continue the patronage  and beethoven relied mostly on selling composition rights and a small pension after 1815.  the effects of these financial arrangements were undermined to some extent by war with france  which caused significant inflation when the government printed money to fund its war needed beethoven s return to vienna from heiligenstadt was marked by a change in musical style  and is now designated as the start of his middle or  heroic  period  according to carl czerny  beethoven said   i am not satisfied with the work i have done so far  from now on i intend to take a new this  heroic  phase was characterised by a large number of original works composed on a grand the first major work employing this new style was the third symphony in e flat  known as the eroica  this work was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony  when it premiered in early 1805  it received a mixed reception  some listeners objected to its length or misunderstood its structure  while others viewed it as a  middle period  is sometimes associated with a  heroic  manner of but the use of the term  heroic  has become increasingly controversial in beethoven scholarship  the term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle the appropriateness of the term  heroic  to describe the whole middle period has been questioned as well  while some works  like the third and fifth symphonies  are easy to describe as  heroic   many others  like his symphony no  6,  pastoral  are of the middle period works extend the musical language beethoven had inherited from haydn and mozart  the middle period work includes the third through eighth symphonies  the rasumovsky  harp and serioso string quartets  the waldstein and appassionata piano sonatas  christ on the mount of olives  the opera fidelio  the violin concerto and many other compositions  during this time beethoven s income came from publishing his works  from performances of them  and from his patrons  his position at the theater an der wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804,  and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of vienna with his friend stephan von breuning  this slowed work on fidelio  his largest work to date  for a time  it was delayed again by the austrian censor  and finally premiered in november 1805  to houses that were nearly empty because of the french occupation of the city  in addition to being a financial failure  this version of fidelio was also a critical failure  and beethoven began revising may 1809,  when the attacking forces of napoleon bombarded vienna  according to ferdinand ries  beethoven  very worried that the noise would destroy what remained of his hearing  hid in the basement of his brother s house  covering his ears with work of the middle period established beethoven as a master  in a review from 1810,  he was enshrined by e  t  a  hoffmann as one of the three great  romantic  composers  hoffman called beethoven s fifth symphony  one of the most important works of the age  beethoven s love life was hampered by class issues  in late 1801  he met a young countess  julie   giulietta   guicciardi through the brunsvik family  at a time when he was giving regular piano lessons to josephine brunsvik  beethoven mentions his love for julie in a november 1801  letter to his boyhood friend  franz wegeler  but he could not consider marrying her  due to the class difference  beethoven later dedicated to her his sonata no  14,  now commonly known as the moonlight sonata or mondscheinsonate  in relationship with josephine brunsvik deepened after the death in 1804  of her aristocratic first husband  the count joseph deym  beethoven wrote josephine 15  passionate love letters from late 1804  to around 1809/10.  although his feelings were obviously reciprocated  josephine was forced by her family to withdraw from him in 1807.  she cited her  duty  and the fact that she would have lost the custodianship of her aristocratic children had she married a after josephine married baron von stackelberg in 1810,  beethoven may have proposed unsuccessfully to therese malfatti  the supposed dedicatee of  für his status as a commoner may again have interfered with those plans in the spring of 1811  beethoven became seriously ill  suffering headaches and high fever  on the advice of his doctor  he spent six weeks in the bohemian spa town of teplitz  the following winter  which was dominated by work on the seventh symphony  he was again ill  and his doctor ordered him to spend the summer of 1812  at the spa teplitz  it is certain that he was at teplitz when he wrote a love letter to his  immortal the identity of the intended recipient has long been a subject of debate  candidates include julie guicciardi  therese malfatti  josephine brunsvik  and antonie brentano beethoven visited his brother johann at the end of october 1812.  he wished to end johann s cohabitation with therese obermayer  a woman who already had an illegitimate child  he was unable to convince johann to end the relationship and appealed to the local civic and religious authorities  johann and therese married on 9  early 1813  beethoven apparently went through a difficult emotional period  and his compositional output dropped  his personal appearance degraded—it had generally been neat—as did his manners in public  especially when dining  beethoven took care of his brother  who was suffering from tuberculosis  and his family  an expense that he claimed left him penniless beethoven was finally motivated to begin significant composition again in june 1813,  when news arrived of the defeat of one of napoleon s armies at vitoria  spain  by a coalition of forces under the duke of wellington  this news stimulated him to write the battle symphony known as wellington s victory  it was first performed on 8  december  along with his seventh symphony  at a charity concert for victims of the war  the work was a popular hit  probably because of its programmatic style  which was entertaining and easy to understand  it received repeat performances at concerts beethoven staged in january and february 1814.  beethoven s renewed popularity led to demands for a revival of fidelio  which  in its third revised version  was also well received at its july opening  that summer he composed a piano sonata for the first time in five years  no  27,  opus 90).  this work was in a markedly more romantic style than his earlier sonatas  he was also one of many composers who produced music in a patriotic vein to entertain the many heads of state and diplomats who came to the congress of vienna that began in november 1814.  his output of songs included his only song cycle   an die ferne geliebte   and the extraordinarily expressive second setting of the poem  an die hoffnung   op  94)  in 1815.  compared to its first setting in 1805   a gift for josephine brunsvik   it was  far more dramatic     the entire spirit is that of an operatic 1815  and 1817  beethoven s output dropped again  beethoven attributed part of this to a lengthy illness  he called it an  inflammatory fever   that afflicted him for more than a year  starting in october biographers have speculated on a variety of other reasons that also contributed to the decline  including the difficulties in the personal lives of his would-be  paramours and the harsh censorship policies of the austrian government  the illness and death of his brother kaspar from tuberculosis may also have played a role kaspar had been ill for some time  and beethoven spent a small fortune in 1815  on his care  after kaspar died on 15  november 1815,  beethoven immediately became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with kaspar s wife johanna over custody of their son karl  de   then nine years old  beethoven  who considered johanna an unfit parent because of her morals  she had an illegitimate child by a different father before marrying kaspar and had been convicted of theft  and financial management  had successfully applied to kaspar to have himself named sole guardian of the boy  a late codicil to kaspar s will gave him and johanna joint guardianship  while beethoven was successful at having his nephew removed from her custody in february 1816,  the case was not fully resolved until 1820,  and he was frequently preoccupied by the demands of the litigation and seeing to the welfare of karl  whom he first placed in a private school the austrian court system had one court for the nobility and members of the landtafel  the landrechte  and many other courts for commoners  among them the civil court of the vienna magistrate  beethoven disguised the fact that the dutch  van  in his name did not denote nobility as does the german and his case was tried in the landrechte  owing to his influence with the court  beethoven felt assured of the favourable outcome of being awarded sole guardianship  while giving evidence to the landrechte  however  beethoven was unable to prove being of noble and as a consequence  on 18  december 1818  the case was transferred to the magistracy  where he lost sole guardianship beethoven appealed and regained custody  johanna s appeal to the emperor was not successful  the emperor  washed his hands of the matter   during the years of custody that followed  beethoven attempted to ensure that karl lived to the highest moral standards  beethoven had an overbearing manner and frequently interfered in his nephew s life  karl attempted suicide on 31  july 1826  by shooting himself in the head  he survived and was brought to his mother s house  where he recuperated  he and beethoven were reconciled  but karl insisted on joining the army and last saw beethoven in january began a renewed study of older music  including works by j  s  bach and handel  that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions  he composed the overture the consecration of the house  which was the first work to attempt to incorporate these influences  a new style emerged  now called his  late period   he returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade  the works of the late period are commonly held to include the last five piano sonatas and the diabelli variations  the last two sonatas for cello and piano  the late string quartets  see below   and two works for very large forces  the missa solemnis and the ninth needed by early 1818  beethoven s health had improved  and his nephew moved in with him in january  on the downside  his hearing had deteriorated to the point that conversation became difficult  necessitating the use of conversation books  his household management had also improved somewhat  nanette streicher  who had assisted in his care during his illness  continued to provide some support  and he finally found a skilled his musical output in 1818  was still somewhat reduced  but included song collections and the  hammerklavier  sonata  as well as sketches for two symphonies that eventually coalesced into the epic ninth  in 1819  he was again preoccupied by the legal processes around karl  and began work on the diabelli variations and the missa needed for the next few years he continued to work on the missa  composing piano sonatas and bagatelles to satisfy the demands of publishers and the need for income  and completing the diabelli variations  he was ill again for an extended time in 1821,  and completed the missa in 1823,  three years after its original due date  he also opened discussions with his publishers over the possibility of producing a complete edition of his work  an idea that was arguably not fully realised until needed  beethoven s brother johann began to take a hand in his business affairs  much in the way kaspar had earlier  locating older unpublished works to offer for publication and offering the missa to multiple publishers with the goal of getting a higher price for needed two commissions in 1822  improved beethoven s financial prospects  the philharmonic society of london offered a commission for a symphony  and prince nikolas golitsin of st  petersburg offered to pay beethoven s price for three string quartets  the first of these commissions spurred beethoven to finish the ninth symphony  which was first performed  along with the missa solemnis  on 7  may 1824,  to great acclaim at the kärntnertortheater  the allgemeine musikalische zeitung gushed   inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world   and carl czerny wrote that his symphony  breathes such a fresh  lively  indeed youthful spirit     so much power  innovation  and beauty as ever from the head of this original man  although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads   unlike his more lucrative earlier concerts  this did not make beethoven much money  as the expenses of mounting it were significantly a second concert on 24  may  in which the producer guaranteed beethoven a minimum fee  was poorly attended  nephew karl noted that  many people already gone into the country   it was beethoven s last public then turned to writing the string quartets for golitsin  this series of quartets  known as the  late quartets   went far beyond what musicians or audiences were ready for at that time  one commented that  we know there is something there  but we do not know what it is   composer louis spohr called them  indecipherable  uncorrected horrors   opinion has changed considerably from the time of their first bewildered reception  their forms and ideas inspired musicians and composers including richard wagner and béla bartók  and continue to do so  of the late quartets  beethoven s favourite was the fourteenth quartet  op  131  in c♯ minor  which he rated as his most
