 a drought is a period of below-average  precipitation in a given region  resulting in prolonged shortages in the water supply  whether atmospheric  surface water or ground water  a drought can last for months or years  or may be declared after as few as 15  it can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected and harm to the local annual dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of a drought developing and subsequent bush fires  periods of heat can significantly worsen drought conditions by hastening evaporation of water vapour many plant species  such as those in the family cactaceae  or cacti   have drought tolerance adaptations like reduced leaf area and waxy cuticles to enhance their ability to tolerate drought  some others survive dry periods as buried seeds  semi-permanent  drought produces arid biomes such as deserts and prolonged droughts have caused mass migrations and humanitarian crises  most arid ecosystems have inherently low productivity  the most prolonged drought ever in the world in recorded history occurred in the atacama desert in chile (400  of producing precipitation include convective  and orographic convective processes involve strong vertical motions that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy while stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation over a longer precipitation can be divided into three categories  based on whether it falls as liquid water  liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface  or ice  droughts occur mainly in areas where normal levels of rainfall are  in themselves  low  if these factors do not support precipitation volumes sufficient to reach the surface over a sufficient time  the result is a drought  drought can be triggered by a high level of reflected sunlight and above average prevalence of high pressure systems  winds carrying continental  rather than oceanic air masses  and ridges of high pressure areas aloft can prevent or restrict the developing of thunderstorm activity or rainfall over one certain region  once a region is within drought  feedback mechanisms such as local arid hot conditions which can promote warm core and minimal evapotranspiration can worsen drought conditions within the tropics  distinct  wet and dry seasons emerge due to the movement of the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon the dry season greatly increases drought and is characterized by its low humidity  with watering holes and rivers drying up  because of the lack of these watering holes  many grazing animals are forced to migrate due to the lack of water and feed to more fertile spots  examples of such animals are zebras  and wildebeest  because of the lack of water in the plants  bushfires are since water vapor becomes more energetic with increasing temperature  more water vapor is required to increase relative humidity values to 100%  at higher temperatures  or to get the temperature to fall to the dew periods of warmth quicken the pace of fruit and vegetable increase evaporation and transpiration from and worsen drought and hotter weather occurs in parts of the amazon river basin  colombia  and central america during el niño events  winters during the el niño are warmer and drier than average conditions in the northwest  northern midwest  and northern mideast united states  so those regions experience reduced snowfalls  conditions are also drier than normal from december to february in south-central  africa  mainly in zambia  zimbabwe  mozambique  and botswana  direct effects of el niño resulting in drier conditions occur in parts of southeast asia and northern australia  increasing bush fires  worsening haze  and decreasing air quality dramatically  drier-than-normal  conditions are also in general observed in queensland  inland victoria  inland new south wales  and eastern tasmania from june to august  as warm water spreads from the west pacific and the indian ocean to the east pacific  it causes extensive drought in the western pacific  singapore experienced the driest february in 2014  since records began in 1869,  with only 6.3  mm of rain falling in the month and temperatures hitting as high as 35  °c on 26  february  the years 1968  and 2005  had the next driest februaries  when 8.4  mm of rain activity can directly trigger exacerbating factors such as over farming  excessive deforestation  and erosion adversely impact the ability of the land to capture and hold in arid climates  the main source of erosion is erosion can be the result of material movement by the wind  the wind can cause small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region  deflation   suspended particles within the wind may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion  ecological succession   wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation  often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support is a homogeneous  typically nonstratified  porous  friable  slightly coherent  often calcareous  fine-grained,  silty  pale yellow or buff  windblown  aeolian  it generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick  loess often stands in either steep or vertical loess tends to develop into highly rich soils  under appropriate climatic conditions  areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature  and will erode very readily  therefore  windbreaks  such as big trees and bushes  are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of wind erosion is much more severe in arid areas and during times of drought  for example  in the great plains  it is estimated that soil loss due to wind erosion can be as much as 6100  times greater in drought years than in wet resulting in global climate change are expected to trigger droughts with a substantial impact on throughout the world  and especially in developing overall  global warming will result in increased world along with drought in some areas  flooding and erosion will increase in others  paradoxically  some proposed solutions to global warming that focus on more active techniques  solar radiation management through the use of a space sunshade for one  may also carry with them increased chances of a drought persists  the conditions surrounding it gradually worsen and its impact on the local population gradually increases  people tend to define droughts in three main ways  effects of droughts and water shortages can be divided into three groups  environmental  economic and social consequences  in the case of environmental effects  lower surface and subterranean water levels  lower flow levels  with a decrease below the minimum leading to direct danger for amphibian life   increased pollution of surface water  the drying out of wetlands  more and larger fires  higher deflation intensity  losing biodiversity  worse health of trees and the appearance of pests and den droid diseases  economic losses include lower agricultural  forests  game and fishing output  higher food production costs  lower energy production levels in hydro plants  losses caused by depleted water tourism and transport revenue  problems with water supply for the energy sector and technological processes in metallurgy  mining  the chemical  paper  wood  foodstuff industries etc   disruption of water supplies for municipal economies  meanwhile  social costs include the negative effect on the health of people directly exposed to this phenomenon  excessive heat waves   possible limitation of water supplies and its increased pollution levels  high food costs  stress caused by failed harvests  etc  this is why droughts and fresh water shortages may be considered as a factor which increases the gap between developed and developing effect varies according to vulnerability  for example  subsistence farmers are more likely to migrate during drought because they do not have alternative food sources  areas with populations that depend on water sources as a major food source are more vulnerable to famine drought can also reduce water because lower water flows reduce dilution of pollutants and increase contamination of remaining water sources  common consequences of drought include drought is a normal  recurring feature of the climate in most parts of the world  it is among the earliest documented climatic events  present in the epic of gilgamesh and tied to the biblical story of joseph s arrival in and the later exodus from ancient hunter-gatherer  migrations in 9,500  bc chile have been linked to the as has the exodus of early humans out of africa and into the rest of the world around 135,000  years historical droughts include the darfur conflict in sudan  also affecting chad  was fueled by decades of drought  combination of drought  desertification and overpopulation are among the causes of the darfur conflict  because the arab baggara nomads searching for water have to take their livestock further south  to land mainly occupied by non-arab  farming 2.4  billion people live in the drainage basin of the himalayan india  china  pakistan  bangladesh  nepal and myanmar could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades  drought in india affecting the ganges is of particular concern  as it provides drinking water and agricultural irrigation for more than 500  million the west coast of north america  which gets much of its water from glaciers in mountain ranges such as the rocky mountains and sierra nevada  also would be 2005,  parts of the amazon basin experienced the worst drought in 100  a 23  july 2006  article reported woods hole research center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of scientists at the brazilian national institute of amazonian research argue in the article that this drought response  coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate  are pushing the rainforest towards a  tipping point  where it would irreversibly start to die  it concludes that the rainforest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert  with catastrophic consequences for the world s climate  according to the wwf  the combination of climate change and deforestation increases the drying effect of dead trees that fuels forest far the largest part of australia is desert or semi-arid  lands commonly known as the outback  a 2005  study by australian and american researchers investigated the desertification of the interior  and suggested that one explanation was related to human settlers who arrived about 50,000  years ago  regular burning by these settlers could have prevented monsoons from reaching interior in june 2008  it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term  maybe irreversible  severe ecological damage for the whole murray-darling  basin if it did not receive sufficient water by october australia could experience more severe droughts and they could become more frequent in the future  a government-commissioned  report said on july 6,  australian environmentalist tim flannery  predicted that unless it made drastic changes  perth in western australia could become the world’s first ghost metropolis  an abandoned city with no more water to sustain its the long australian millennial drought broke in 2010.recurring  droughts leading to desertification in east africa have created grave ecological catastrophes  prompting food shortages in 1984–85,  2006  and during the 2011  drought  an estimated 50,000  to 150,000  people were reported to have though these figures and the extent of the crisis are in february 2012,  the un announced that the crisis was over due to a scaling up of relief efforts and a bumper aid agencies subsequently shifted their emphasis to recovery efforts  including digging irrigation canals and distributing plant 2012,  a severe drought struck the western sahel  the methodist relief   development fund  mrdf  reported that more than 10  million people in the region were at risk of famine due to a month-long  heat wave that was hovering over niger  mali  mauritania and burkina faso  a fund of about £20,000  was distributed to the drought-hit  people can effectively mitigate much of the impact of drought through irrigation and crop rotation  failure to develop adequate drought mitigation strategies carries a grave human cost in the modern era  exacerbated by ever-increasing  population densities  president roosevelt on april 27,  1935,  signed documents creating the soil conservation service  scs —now the natural resources conservation service  nrcs   models of the law were sent to each state where they were enacted  these were the first enduring practical programs to curtail future susceptibility to drought  creating agencies that first began to stress soil conservation measures to protect farm lands today  it was not until the 1950s  that there was an importance placed on water conservation was put into the existing laws  nrcs for drought protection  mitigation or relief include regional
