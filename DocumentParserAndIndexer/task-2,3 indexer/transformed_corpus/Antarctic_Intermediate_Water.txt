 antarctic intermediate water  aaiw  is a cold  relatively low salinity water mass found mostly at intermediate depths in the southern ocean  the aaiw is formed at the ocean surface in the antarctic convergence zone or more commonly called the antarctic polar front zone  this convergence zone is normally located between 50°s  and 60°s,  hence this is where almost all of the aaiw is formed the aaiw is unique water mass in that it is a sinking water mass with a moderately low salinity  unlike most sinking water masses which have a relatively high salinity  this salinity minimum  unique to the aaiw  can be recognized throughout the southern ocean at depths ranging from 700  to 1200  meters  typical temperature values for the aaiw are 3-7°c,  and a salinity of 34.2-34.4  psu upon initial formation  due to vertical mixing at intermediate depths in the southern ocean  the salinity slowly rises as it moves northward  typical density of aaiw water is between 1026.82  kg m³ and 1027.43  the thickness of the aaiw ranges greatly between where it forms and its most northern extent the formation of aaiw can be explained very simply through the ekman transport process and the divergence and convergence of water masses  the winds over antarctica are called the polar easterlies where winds blow from the east to the west  this creates a counter-clockwise  surface current near the coast of antarctica  called the antarctic coastal current  ekman transport causes the water to push towards the left of the surface motion in the southern hemisphere  thus  this westward directed coastal current in antarctica will push the water towards antarctica  at the same time there is a strong current north of the antarctic coastal current  called the antarctic circumpolar current  acc  created by the strong westerlies in this region which flows clockwise around antarctica  again  ekman transport will push this water to the left of the surface motion  meaning away from antarctica  because water just offshore of antarctica is being pushed away and into antarctica  it leads to the antarctic divergence region  here  upwelling of north atlantic deep water  nadw  takes place  nadw is cold and quite saline  once the nadw is upwelled to the surface some of it diverges towards antarctica  gets colder  and sinks back down as antarctic bottom nadw water also diverges away from antarctica when it is upwelled  this diverged water moves northward  equatorward   and at the same time persistent precipitation  location is near the polar lows ~60°s)  along with an influx of melt water decreases the salinity of the original nadw  because the salinity of the nadw has changed by so much and it has essentially lost all its unique characteristics to be nadw  this northward propagating surface water is now called antarctic surface water  aasw   also  the aasw movement northward has gained some heat from the atmosphere  thereby increasing the temperature slightly  when this water reaches between 50°s  and 60°s  it encounters the antarctic convergence zone  at this point the subantarctic waters  which are characterized as being much warmer than the antarctic waters  are just north of the antarctic polar front and the antarctic waters are just south of the antarctic polar front  this region is referred to as the antarctic convergence zone antarctic polar front because of the sharp gradients in both temperature and salinity  esp  temperature  between the antarctic waters and the subantarctic waters  it is also a region of strong vertical it is important to note that this convergence zone does not occur simply because the subantarctic water is flowing southward and the aasw is flowing northward  but due to ekman convergence once the northward propagating antarctic surface water reaches the antarctic convergence zone it begins to sink because it is more dense than the subantarctic water to its north  but less dense than the antarctic water to its south  this water is then referred to as aaiw  the sinking aaiw becomes sandwiched between the subantarctic water  above  which is much warmer  but more saline and the nadw  below  which is cold and quite salty  for many years the aforementioned formation of aaiw was thought to be the only formation process  however recent studies have found that there exists some evidence that some subantarctic mode water is able to penetrate through the subantarctic front  frontal region separating the polar frontal zone from the subantarctic zone  and become the dominant source of aaiw  rather than the aasw  because of the difficulty of getting observations in this very treacherous area  this research on subantarctic mode water mixing theory is still being worked out  but a lot of evidence exists for its inclusion in the formation of it is important to note that the biggest source of aaiw formation is just southwest of the southern tip of south america the interesting characteristic of aaiw is how far it extends northward  the salinity minima associated with the aaiw can be seen in intermediate waters (~1000m)  as far north as 20°n,  with trace amounts as far as 60°n.  it is by far the largest spreading intermediate water of all the ocean intermediate water masses  it continues northward until it encounters other intermediate water masses the movement of the aaiw is predominantly northward due to the ekman volume transport mostly directed in that way  when the aaiw is initially formed  the acc is able to transport the aaiw into all ocean basins because the acc flows clockwise around antarctica with no land based boundaries
