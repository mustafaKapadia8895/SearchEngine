 major trauma is any injury that has the potential to cause prolonged disability or there are many causes of major trauma  blunt and penetrating  including falls  motor vehicle collisions  stabbing wounds  and gunshot wounds  depending on the severity of injury  quickness of management and transportation to an appropriate medical facility  called a trauma center  may be necessary to prevent loss of life or limb  the initial assessment is critical  and involves a physical evaluation and also may include the use of imaging tools to determine the types of injuries accurately and to formulate a course of treatment in 2002,  unintentional and intentional injuries were the fifth and seventh leading causes of deaths worldwide  accounting for 6.23%  and 2.84%  of all deaths  for research purposes the definition often is based on an injury severity score  iss  of greater than generally are classified by either severity  the location of damage  or a combination of trauma also may be classified by demographic group  such as age or it also may be classified by the type of force applied to the body  such as blunt trauma or penetrating trauma  for research purposes injury may be classified using the barell matrix  which is based on icd-9-cm.  the purpose of the matrix is for international standardization of the classification of major trauma sometimes is classified by body area  injuries affecting 40%  are polytrauma  30%  head injuries  20%  chest trauma  10%,  abdominal trauma  and 2%,  extremity scales exist to provide a quantifiable metric to measure the severity of injuries  the value may be used for triaging a patient or for statistical analysis  injury scales measure damage to anatomical parts  physiological values  blood pressure etc    comorbidities  or a combination of those  the abbreviated injury scale and the glasgow coma scale are used commonly to quantify injuries for the purpose of triaging and allow a system to monitor or  trend  a patient s condition in a clinical the data also may be used in epidemiological investigations and for research 2%  of those who have experienced significant trauma have a spinal cord may be caused by any combination of external forces that act physically against the the leading causes of traumatic death are blunt trauma  motor vehicle collisions  and falls  followed by penetrating trauma such as stab wounds or impaled subsets of blunt trauma  are the number one and two causes of traumatic statistical purposes  injuries are classified as either intentional such as suicide  or unintentional  such as a motor vehicle collision  intentional injury is a common cause of penetrating trauma is caused when a foreign body such as a bullet or a knife enters the body tissue  creating an open wound  in the united states  most deaths caused by penetrating trauma occur in urban areas and 80%  of these deaths are caused by blast injury is a complex cause of trauma because it commonly includes both blunt and penetrating trauma  and also may be accompanied by a burn injury  trauma also may be associated with a particular activity  such as an occupational or sports body responds to traumatic injury both systemically and at the injury this response attempts to protect vital organs such as the liver  to allow further cell duplication and to heal the the healing time of an injury depends on various factors including sex  age  and the severity of symptoms of injury may manifest in many different ways  organ systems respond to injury to restore homeostasis by maintaining perfusion to the heart and inflammation after injury occurs to protect against further damage and starts the healing process  prolonged inflammation may cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome or systemic inflammatory response immediately after injury  the body increases production of glucose through gluconeogenesis and its consumption of fat via lipolysis  next  the body tries to replenish its energy stores of glucose and protein via anabolism  in this state the body will temporarily increase its maximum expenditure for the purpose of healing injured initial assessment is critical in determining the extent of injuries and what will be needed to manage an injury  and for treating immediate life threats primary physical examination is undertaken to identify any life-threatening  problems  after which the secondary examination is carried out  this may occur during transportation or upon arrival at the hospital  the secondary examination consists of a systematic assessment of the abdominal  pelvic  and thoracic areas  a complete inspection of the body surface to find all injuries  and a neurological examination  injuries that may manifest themselves later  may be missed during the initial assessment  such as when a patient is brought into a hospital s emergency generally  the physical examination is performed in a systematic way that first checks for any immediate life threats  primary survey   and then taking a more in depth examination  secondary with major trauma commonly have chest and pelvic x-rays  and  depending on the mechanism of injury and presentation  a focused assessment with sonography for trauma  fast  exam to check for internal bleeding  for those with relatively stable blood pressure  heart rate  and sufficient oxygenation  ct scans are full-body  ct scans  known as pan-scans,  improve the survival rate of those who have suffered major these scans use intravenous injections for the radiocontrast agent  but not oral there are concerns that intravenous contrast administration in trauma situations without confirming adequate renal function may cause damage to kidneys  but this does not appear to be the u s   ct or mri scans are performed on 15%  of those with trauma in emergency where blood pressure is low or the heart rate is increased—likely from bleeding in the abdomen—immediate surgery bypassing a ct scan is modern 64-slice  ct scans are able to rule out with a high degree of accuracy  significant injuries to the neck following blunt techniques  using a tube or catheter to drain fluid from the peritoneum  chest  or the pericardium around the heart  often are used in cases of severe blunt trauma to the chest or abdomen  especially when a person is experiencing early signs of shock  in those with low blood-pressure,  likely because of bleeding in the abdominal cavity  cutting through the abdominal wall surgically is identifying risk factors present within a community and creating solutions to decrease the incidence of injury  trauma referral systems may help to enhance the overall health of a injury prevention strategies are commonly used to prevent injuries in children  who are a high risk injury prevention strategies generally involve educating the general public about specific risk factors and developing strategies to avoid or reduce legislation intended to prevent injury typically involves seatbelts  child car-seats,  helmets  alcohol control  and increased enforcement of the other controllable factors  such as the use of drugs including alcohol or cocaine  increases the risk of trauma by increasing the likelihood of traffic collisions  violence  and abuse prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines may increase the risk of trauma in elderly care of acutely injured people in a public health system requires the involvement of bystanders  community members  health care professionals  and health care systems  it encompasses pre-hospital  trauma assessment and care by emergency medical services personnel  emergency department assessment  treatment  stabilization  and in-hospital  care among all age an established trauma system network is also an important component of community disaster preparedness  facilitating the care of people who have been involved in disasters that cause large numbers of casualties  such as pre-hospital  use of stabilization techniques improves the chances of a person surviving the journey to the nearest trauma-equipped  hospital  emergency medicine services determines which people need treatment at a trauma center as well as provide primary stabilization by checking and treating airway  breathing  and circulation as well as assessing for disability and gaining exposure to check for other motion restriction by securing the neck with a cervical collar and placing the person on a long spine board was of high importance in the pre-hospital  setting  but due to lack of evidence to support its use  the practice is losing favor  instead  it is recommend that more exclusive criteria be met such as age and neurological deficits to indicate the need of these this may be accomplished with other medical transport devices such as a kendrick extrication device  before moving the it is important to quickly control severe bleeding with direct pressure to the wound and consider the use of hemostatic agents or tourniquets if the bleeding conditions such as impending airway obstruction  enlargening neck hematoma  or unconsciousness require intubation  it is unclear  however  if this is best performed before reaching hospital or in the transportation of severely injured patients improves the outcome in helicopter ems transport reduces mortality compared to ground-based  transport in adult trauma before arrival at the hospital  the availability of advanced life support does not greatly improve the outcome for major trauma when compared to the administration of basic life evidence is inconclusive in determining support for pre-hospital  intravenous fluid resuscitation while some evidence has found it may be hospitals with designated trauma centers have improved outcomes when compared to hospitals without and outcomes may improve when persons who have experienced trauma are transferred directly to a trauma of those with trauma often requires the help of many healthcare specialists including physicians  nurses  respiratory therapists  and social workers  cooperation allows many actions to be completed at once  generally the first step of managing trauma is to perform a primary survey that evaluates a person s airway  breathing  circulation  and neurologic after immediate life threats are controlled  a person is either moved into an operating room for immediate surgical correction of the injuries  or a secondary survey is performed that is a more detailed head-to-toe  assessment of the for intubation include airway obstruction  inability to protect the airway  and respiratory examples of these indications include penetrating neck trauma  expanding neck hematoma  and being unconscious  among other indications  in general  the method of intubation used is rapid sequence intubation followed by ventilation  assessment of circulation in those with trauma includes control of active bleeding  when a person is first brought in  vital signs are checked  an ecg is performed  and  if needed  vascular access is obtained  other tests should be performed to get a baseline measurement of their current blood chemistry  such as a arterial blood gas or in those with cardiac arrest due to trauma chest compressions are considered futile  but still correcting the underlying cause such as a pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade  if present  may fast exam may help assess for internal bleeding  in certain traumas  such as maxillofacial trauma  it may be beneficial to have a highly trained health care provider available to maintain airway  breathing  and high-volume  intravenous fluids were given to people who had poor perfusion due to this is still appropriate in cases with isolated extremity trauma  thermal trauma  or head in general  however  giving lots of fluids appears to increase the risk of current evidence supports limiting the use of fluids for penetrating thorax and abdominal injuries  allowing mild hypotension to targets include a mean arterial pressure of 60  mmhg  a systolic blood pressure of 70–90  or the re-establishment  of peripheral pulses and adequate ability to hypertonic saline has been studied and found to be of little difference from normal no intravenous fluids used for initial resuscitation have been shown to be superior  warmed lactated ringer s solution continues to be the solution of if blood products are needed  a greater use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets relative to packed red blood cells has been found to improve survival and lower overall blood product a ratio of 1:1:1  is the success of platelets has been attributed to the fact that they may prevent coagulopathy from cell salvage and autotransfusion also may be substitutes such as hemoglobin-based  oxygen carriers are in development  however  as of 2013  there are none available for commercial use in north america or these products are only available for general use in south africa and acid decreases the mortality rate in people who are bleeding due to it only appears to be beneficial  however  if administered within the first three hours after for severe bleeding  for example from bleeding disorders  recombinant factor viia—a protein that assists blood clotting—may be while it decreases blood use  it does not appear to decrease the mortality in those without previous factor vii deficiency  its use is not recommended outside of trial medications may be used in conjunction with other procedures to stabilize a person who has sustained a significant while positive inotropic medications such as norepinephrine sometimes are used in hemorrhagic shock as a result of trauma  there is a lack of evidence for their therefore  as of 2012  they have not been allowing a low blood pressure may be preferred in some decision whether to perform surgery is determined by the extent of the damage and the anatomical location of the injury  bleeding must be controlled before definitive repair may damage control surgery is used to manage severe trauma in which there is a cycle of metabolic acidosis  hypothermia  and hypotension that may lead to death  if not the main principal of the procedure involves performing the least number of procedures to save life and limb  less critical procedures are left until the victim is more approximately 15%  of all people with trauma have abdominal injuries  and approximately 25%  of these require exploratory surgery  the majority of preventable deaths from trauma result from unrecognised intra-abdominal  deaths occur in immediate  early  or late stages  immediate deaths usually are due to apnea  severe brain or high spinal cord injury  or rupture of the heart or of large blood vessels  early deaths occur within minutes to hours and often are due to hemorrhages in the outer meningeal layer of the brain  torn arteries  blood around the lungs  air around the lungs  ruptured spleen  liver laceration  or pelvic fracture  immediate access to care may be crucial to prevent death in persons experiencing major trauma  late deaths occurs days or weeks after the and often are related to prognosis is better in countries with a dedicated trauma system where injured persons are provided quick and effective access to proper treatment prognosis frequently is complicated by pain  more than half of trauma patients have moderate to severe pain one year after many also experience a reduced quality of life years after an with 20%  of victims sustaining some form of physical trauma may lead to development of post-traumatic  stress disorder one study has found no correlation between the severity of trauma and the development of is the sixth leading cause of death worldwide  resulting in five million or 10%  of all deaths it is the fifth leading cause of significant about half of trauma deaths are in people aged between 15  and 45  years and trauma is the leading cause of death in this age injury affects more males  68%  of injuries occur in and death from trauma is twice as common in males as it is in females  this is believed to be because males are much more willing to engage in risk-taking  teenagers and young adults are more likely to need hospitalization from injuries than other age while elderly persons are less likely to be injured  they are more likely to die from injuries sustained due to various physiological differences that make it more difficult for the body to compensate for the the primary causes of traumatic death are central nervous system injuries and substantial blood various classification scales exist for use with trauma to determine the severity of injuries  which are used to determine the resources used and  for statistical collection the human remains discovered at the site of nataruk in turkana  kenya  are claimed to show major trauma  blunt and penetrating trauma  caused by violent trauma to the head  neck  ribs  knees  and hands that has been interpreted by some researchers as establishing the existence of warfare between two groups of hunter-gatherers  10,000  years the evidence for blunt force trauma at nataruk has been challenged  however  and the interpretation that the site represents an early example of warfare has been financial cost of trauma includes both the amount of money spent on treatment and the loss of potential economic gain through absence from work  the average financial cost for the treatment of traumatic injury in the united states is approximately us$334,000  per person  making it costlier than the treatment of cancer and cardiovascular one reason for the high cost of the treatment for trauma is the increased possibility of complications  which leads to the need for more maintaining a trauma center is costly because they are open continuously and maintain a state of readiness to receive patients  even if there are in addition to the direct costs of the treatment  there also is a burden on the economy due to lost wages and productivity  which in 2009,  accounted for approximately us$693.5  billion in the united of low-  and middle-income  countries  lmics  often have higher mortality rates from injury  these countries accounted for 89%  of all deaths from injury many of these countries do not have access to sufficient surgical care and many do not have a trauma system in place  in addition  most lmics do not have a pre-hospital  care system that treats injured persons initially and transports them to hospital quickly  resulting in most casualty paients being transported by private vehicles  also  their hospitals lack the appropriate equipment  organizational resources  or trained by 2020,  the amount of trauma-related  deaths is expected to decline in high-income  countries  while in low-  to middle-income  countries it is expected to to anatomical and physiological differences  injuries in children need to be approached differently from those in accidents are the leading cause of death in children between 1  and 14  years in the united states  approximately sixteen million children go to an emergency department due to some form of injury every with boys being more frequently injured than girls by a ratio of the world s five most common unintentional injuries in children as of 2008  are road crashes  drowning  burns  falls  and estimation is an important part of managing trauma in children because the accurate dosing of medicine may be critical for resuscitative a number of methods to estimate weight  including the broselow tape  leffler formula  and theron formula occurs in approximately 5%  of all and is the leading cause of maternal death  additionally  pregnant women may experience placental abruption  pre-term  labor  and uterine there are diagnostic issues during pregnancy  ionizing radiation has been shown to cause birth although the doses used for typical exams generally are considered due to normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy  shock may be more difficult to where the woman is more than 23  weeks pregnant  it is recommended that the fetus be monitored for at least four hours by number of treatments beyond typical trauma care may be needed when the patient is pregnant  because the weight of the uterus on the inferior vena cava may decrease blood return to the heart  it may be very beneficial to lay a women in late pregnancy on her left also recommended are rho d  immune globulin in those who are rh negative  corticosteroids in those who are 24  to 34  weeks and may need delivery or a caesarian section in the event of cardiac research on trauma occurs during war and military conflicts as militaries will increase trauma research spending in order to prevent combat related some research is being conducted on patients who were admitted into an intensive care unit or trauma center  and received a trauma diagnosis that caused a negative change in their health-related  quality of life  with a potential to create anxiety and symptoms of new preserved blood products also are being researched for use in pre-hospital  care  it is impractical to use the currently available blood products in a timely fashion in remote  rural settings or in theaters of
