 dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor  when further cooled  the airborne water vapor will condense to form liquid water  dew   when air cools to its dew point through contact with a surface that is colder than the air  water will condense on the when the temperature is below the freezing point of water  the dew point is called the frost point  as frost is formed rather than the measurement of the dew point is related to humidity  a higher dew point means there will be more moisture in the that all the other factors influencing humidity remain constant  at ground level the relative humidity rises as the temperature falls  this is because less vapor is needed to saturate the air so  vapor condenses as the temperature falls  dew point temperature is never greater than the air temperature because relative humidity cannot exceed technical terms  the dew point is the temperature at which the water vapor in a sample of air at constant barometric pressure condenses into liquid water at the same rate at which it at temperatures below the dew point  the rate of condensation will be greater than that of evaporation  forming more liquid water  the condensed water is called dew when it forms on a solid surface  or frost if it freezes  the condensed water is called either fog or a cloud  depending on its altitude  when it forms in the air a high relative humidity implies that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature  a relative humidity of 100%  indicates the dew point is equal to the current temperature and that the air is maximally saturated with water  when the moisture content remains constant and temperature increases  relative humidity aviation pilots use dew point data to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog  and to estimate the height of a cumuliform cloud base at a given temperature but independent of barometric pressure  the dew point is a consequence of the absolute humidity  the mass of water per unit volume of air  if both the temperature and pressure rise  however  the dew point will increase and the relative humidity will decrease accordingly  reducing the absolute humidity without changing other variables will bring the dew point back down to its initial value  in the same way  increasing the absolute humidity after a temperature drop brings the dew point back down to its initial level  if the temperature rises in conditions of constant pressure  then the dew point will remain constant but the relative humidity will drop  for this reason  a constant relative humidity with different temperatures implies that when it is hotter  a higher fraction of the air is present as water vapor compared to when it is cooler at a given barometric pressure but independent of temperature  the dew point indicates the mole fraction of water vapor in the air  or  put differently  determines the specific humidity of the air  if the pressure rises without changing this mole fraction  the dew point will rise accordingly  reducing the mole fraction  i e   making the air less humid  would bring the dew point back down to its initial value  in the same way  increasing the mole fraction after a pressure drop brings the relative humidity back up to its initial level  considering new york (33  ft or 10  m elevation  and denver (5,280  ft or 1,610  m for example  this means that if the dew point and temperature in both cities are the same  then the mass of water vapor per cubic meter of air will be the same  but the mole fraction of water vapor in the air will be greater in denver when the air temperature is high  the human body uses the evaporation of sweat to cool down  with the cooling effect directly related to how fast the perspiration evaporates  the rate at which perspiration can evaporate depends on how much moisture is in the air and how much moisture the air can hold  if the air is already saturated with moisture  perspiration will not evaporate  the body s thermoregulation will produce perspiration in an effort to keep the body at its normal temperature even when the rate it is producing sweat exceeds the evaporation rate  so one can become coated with sweat on humid days even without generating additional body heat  such as by exercising  as the air surrounding one s body is warmed by body heat  it will rise and be replaced with other air  if air is moved away from one s body with a natural breeze or a fan  sweat will evaporate faster  making perspiration more effective at cooling the body  the more unevaporated perspiration  the greater the discomfort a wet bulb thermometer also uses evaporative cooling  so it provides a good measure for use in evaluating comfort level discomfort also exists when the dew point is low  below around −30  °c or −22  needed  the drier air can cause skin to crack and become irritated more easily  it will also dry out the airways  the us occupational safety and health administration recommends indoor air be maintained at 20–24.5  °c (68–76  °f  with a 20–60%  relative humidity  equivalent to a dew point of −4.5  to 15.5  °c (24  to 60  needed lower dew points  less than 10  °c or 50  °f  correlate with lower ambient temperatures and the body requires less cooling  a lower dew point can go along with a high temperature only at extremely low relative humidity  allowing for relatively effective cooling people inhabiting tropical and subtropical climates acclimatize somewhat to higher dew points  thus  a resident of darwin or miami  for example  might have a higher threshold for discomfort than a resident of a temperate climate like london or chicago  those accustomed to temperate climates often begin to feel uncomfortable when the dew point reaches between 15  and 20  °c (59–68  °f   while others might find dew points below 18  °c (64  °f  comfortable  most inhabitants of these areas will consider dew points above 21  °c or 70  °f oppressive and tropical-like.devices  called hygrometers are used to measure dew point over a wide range of temperatures  these devices consist of a polished metal mirror which is cooled as air is passed over it  the temperature at which dew forms is  by definition  the dew point  manual devices of this sort can be used to calibrate other types of humidity sensors  and automatic sensors may be used in a control loop with a humidifier or dehumidifier to control the dew point of the air in a building or in a smaller space for a manufacturing process a dew point of 33  °c (91  °f  was observed at 14:00  edt on july 12,  1987,  in melbourne  florida  a dew point of 32  °c (90  °f  has been observed in the united states on at least two other occasions  appleton  wisconsin  at 17:00  cdt on july 13,  1995,  and new orleans naval air station at 17:00  cdt on july 30,  1987.  a dew point of 35  °c (95  °f  was observed at dhahran  saudi arabia  at 15:00  ast on july 8,  2003,  which caused the heat index to reach 81  °c (178  °f   the highest value recorded a well-known  approximation used to calculate the dew point  tdp  given just the actual   dry bulb   air temperature  t  in degrees celsius  and relative humidity  in percent   rh  is the magnus formula the more complete formulation and origin of this approximation involves the interrelated saturated water vapor pressure  in units of millibars  also called hectopascals  at t  ps t   and the actual vapor pressure  also in units of millibars   pa t   which can be either found with rh or approximated with the barometric pressure  in millibars   bpmb  and "wet-bulb"  temperature  tw is  unless declared otherwise  all temperatures are expressed in degrees celsius  for greater accuracy  ps t   and therefore γ t  rh   can be enhanced  using part of the bögel modification  also known as the arden buck equation  which adds a fourth constant d wherethere are several different constant sets in use  the ones used in noaa s are taken from a 1980  paper by david bolton in the monthly weather valuations provide a maximum error of 0.1%,  for −30  °c ≤ t ≤ 35°c  and 1%    rh   100%.  also noteworthy is the common set of values originates from the 1974  psychrometry and psychrometric charts  as presented by in the journal of applied meteorology and arden buck presents several different valuation sets  with different minimum accuracies for different temperature ranges  two particular sets provide a range of −40  °c to +50  °c between the two  with even greater minimum accuracy than all of the other  above sets  maximum error at extremes of temperature range  there is also a very simple approximation that allows conversion between the dew point  temperature  and relative humidity  this approach is accurate to within about ±1  °c as long as the relative humidity is above 50%:this  can be expressed as a simple rule of thumb for every 1  °c difference in the dew point and dry bulb temperatures  the relative humidity decreases by 5%,  starting with rh   100%  when the dew point equals the dry bulb temperature the derivation of this approach  a discussion of its accuracy  comparisons to other approximations  and more information on the history and applications of the dew point are given in the bulletin of the american meteorological temperatures in degrees fahrenheit  these approximations work out tofor example  a relative humidity of 100%  means dew point is the same as air temp  for 90%  rh  dew point is 3  °f lower than air temperature  for every 10  percent lower  dew point drops 3  °f the frost point is similar to the dew point  in that it is the temperature to which a given parcel of humid air must be cooled  at constant barometric pressure  for water vapor to be deposited on a surface as ice without going through the liquid phase   compare with sublimation   the frost point for a given parcel of air is always higher than the dew point  as the stronger bonding between water molecules on the surface of ice requires higher temperature to
