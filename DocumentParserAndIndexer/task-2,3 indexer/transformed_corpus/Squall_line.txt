 a squall line  also known as a quasi-linear  convective system or qlcs  is a line of thunderstorms forming along or ahead of a cold front  in the early 20th  century  the term was used as a synonym for cold front  it contains heavy precipitation  hail  frequent lightning  strong straight-line  winds  and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts  strong straight-line  winds can occur where the squall line is in the shape of a bow echo  tornadoes can occur along waves within a line echo wave pattern  lewp   where mesoscale low-pressure  areas are present  some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos  and they move quite fast through large sections of territory  on the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines  a wake low can be present  sometimes associated with a heat burst polar front theory was developed by jacob bjerknes  derived from a dense network of observation sites in scandinavia during world war i  this theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence  one ahead of the low and another trailing behind the low  the trailing convergence zone was referred to as the squall line or cold front  areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along this convergence zone  the concept of frontal zones led to the concept of air masses  the nature of the three-dimensional  structure of the cyclone was conceptualized after the development of the upper air network during the areas of thunderstorms activity reinforce pre-existing  frontal zones  and they can outrun cold fronts  this outrunning occurs within the westerlies in a pattern where the upper level jet splits into two streams  the resultant mesoscale convective system  mcs  forms at the point of the upper level split in the wind pattern in the area of best low level inflow the convection then moves east and toward the equator into the warm sector  parallel to low-level  thickness lines  when the convection is strong linear or curved  the mcs is called a squall line  with the feature placed at the leading edge of the significant wind shift and pressure this feature is commonly depicted in the warm season across the united states on surface analyses  as they lie within sharp surface troughs if squall lines form over arid regions  a duststorm known as a haboob may result from the high winds in their wake picking up dust from the desert well behind mature squall lines  a wake low can develop on the back edge of the rain which can lead to a heat burst due to the warming up of the descending air mass which is no longer being cumulus or stratocumulus clouds  along with cirrus  and  sometimes  altocumulus or cirrocumulus  can be found ahead of the squall line  these clouds are the result of former cumulonimbus clouds having disintegrated  or an area of only minor instability ahead of the main squall line as supercells and multi-cell  thunderstorms dissipate due to a weak shear force or poor lifting mechanisms   e g  considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating  the gust front associated with them may outrun the squall line itself and the synoptic scale area of low pressure may then infill  leading to a weakening of the cold front  essentially  the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts  becoming purely a downdraft dominated system  the areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low cape  low humidity  insufficient wind shear  or poor synoptic dynamics  e g  an upper level low filling  leading to frontolysis from here  a general thinning of a squall line will occur  with winds decaying over time  outflow boundaries weakening updrafts substantially and clouds losing their thickness the leading area of a squall line is composed primarily of multiple updrafts  or singular regions of an updraft  rising from ground level to the highest extensions of the troposphere  condensing water and building a dark  ominous cloud to one with a noticeable overshooting top and anvil  thanks to synoptic scale winds   because of the chaotic nature of updrafts and downdrafts  pressure perturbations are important pressure perturbations around thunderstorms are noteworthy  with buoyancy rapid within the lower and mid-levels  of a mature thunderstorm  updraft and downdraft create distinct mesocenters of pressure  as thunderstorms organized in squall lines  the northern end of the squall line is commonly referred to as the cyclonic end  with the southern side rotating anticyclonically  in northern hemisphere   because of the coriolis force  the northern end may evolve further  creating a  comma shaped  wake low  or may continue in a squall-like  pattern  the updraft ahead of the line create a mesolow too while the downdraft just behind the line will produce a mesohigh wind shear is an important aspect of a squall line  in low to medium shear environments  mature thunderstorms will contribute modest amounts of downdrafts  enough to help create a leading edge lifting mechanism â€“ the gust front  in high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds  updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense  common in supercell mesocyclones   the cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level  jet  which aids in downdraft processes severe squall lines typically bow out due to the formation of a stronger mesoscale high-pressure  system  a mesohigh  within the convective area due to strong descending motion behind the squall line  and could come in the form of a the pressure difference between the mesoscale high and the lower pressures ahead of the squall line cause high winds  which are strongest where the line is most bowed out another indication of the presence of severe weather along a squall line is its morphing into a line echo wave pattern  or lewp  a lewp is a special configuration in a line of convective storms that indicates the presence of a low-pressure  area and the possibility of damaging winds  large hail  and tornadoes  at each kink along the lewp is a mesoscale low-pressure  area  which could contain a tornado  in response to very strong outflow southwest of the mesoscale low  a portion of the line bulges outward forming a bow echo  behind this bulge lies the mesoscale high-pressure  lines are depicted on national weather service surface analyses as an alternating pattern of two red dots and a dash labelled  sqln  or  squall derecho  from spanish   derecho  meaning is a widespread and long-lived,  violent convectively induced straight-line  windstorm that is associated with a fast-moving  band of severe thunderstorms usually taking the form of a bow echo  derechos blow in the direction of movement of their associated storms  similar to a gust front  except that the wind is sustained and generally increases in strength behind the  gust  front  a warm weather phenomenon  derechos occur mostly in summer  between may and august in the northern hemisphere  they can occur at any time of the year and occur as frequently at night as in the daylight traditional criteria that distinguish a derecho from a severe thunderstorm are sustained winds of 58  miles per hour (93  km h  during the storm as opposed to gusts  high or rapidly increasing forward speed  and geographic extent  typically 250  nautical miles (460  km  290  mi  in in addition  they have a distinctive appearance on radar  bow echo   several unique features  such as the rear inflow notch and bookend vortex  and usually manifest two or more downbursts  although these storms most commonly occur in north america  derechos occur elsewhere in the world  outside north america they may be called by different names  for example  in bangladesh and adjacent portions of india  a type of storm known as a  nor wester  may be a progressive
