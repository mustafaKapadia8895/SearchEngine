 by volume saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second-largest  in the solar system  after jupiter  it is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of it has only one-eighth  the average density of earth  but with its larger volume saturn is over 95  times more saturn is named after the roman god of agriculture  its astronomical symbol  ♄  represents the god s sickle saturn s interior is probably composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock  silicon and oxygen compounds   this core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen  an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium  and finally a gaseous outer layer  saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere  electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to saturn s planetary magnetic field  which is weaker than earth s  but has a magnetic moment 580  times that of earth due to saturn s larger size  saturn s magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth  of the outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast  although long-lived  features can appear  wind speeds on saturn can reach 1,800  km h (1,100  mph   higher than on jupiter  but not as high as those on planet s most famous feature is its prominent ring system that is composed mostly of ice particles  with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust  at least 62  are known to orbit saturn  of which 53  are officially named  this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in the rings  titan  saturn s largest moon  and the second-largest  in the solar system  is larger than the planet mercury  although less massive  and is the only moon in the solar system to have a substantial is a gas giant because it is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium  it lacks a definite surface  though it may have a solid saturn s rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid  that is  it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator  its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%:  60,268  km versus 54,364  jupiter  uranus  and neptune  the other giant planets in the solar system  are also oblate but to a lesser extent  saturn is the only planet of the solar system that is less dense than water—about 30%  although saturn s core is considerably denser than water  the average specific density of the planet is 0.69  g/cm3  due to the atmosphere  jupiter has 318  times the earth s and saturn is 95  times the mass of the together  jupiter and saturn hold 92%  of the total planetary mass in the solar 8  january 2015,  nasa reported that a team of scientists from the jet propulsion laboratory determined the barycenter of the planet saturn and its family of moons to within 4  km (2.5  mi  using data from an experiment conducted with the cassini spacecraft and the very large baseline consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium  most of saturn s mass is not in the gas phase  because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal  liquid when the density is above 0.01  g/cm3,  which is reached at a radius containing 99.9%  of saturn s mass  the temperature  pressure  and density inside saturn all rise steadily toward the core  which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper planetary models suggest that the interior of saturn is similar to that of jupiter  having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of various this core is similar in composition to the earth  but more dense  examination of saturn s gravitational moment  in combination with physical models of the interior  has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of saturn s core  in 2004,  scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22  times the mass of the which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000  this is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer  followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated  molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude  the outermost layer spans 1,000  km and consists of has a hot interior  reaching 11,700  °c at its core  and it radiates 2.5  times more energy into space than it receives from the sun  jupiter s thermal energy is generated by the kelvin–helmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression  but such a process alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for saturn  because it is less massive  an alternative or additional mechanism may be generation of heat through the  raining out  of droplets of helium deep in saturn s interior  as the droplets descend through the lower-density  hydrogen  the process releases heat by friction and leaves saturn s outer layers depleted of these descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur on saturn  as well as on and ice giants uranus and outer atmosphere of saturn contains 96.3%  molecular hydrogen and 3.25%  helium by the proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the the quantity of elements heavier than helium  metallicity  is not known precisely  but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from the formation of the solar system  the total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 19–31  times the mass of the earth  with a significant fraction located in saturn s core amounts of ammonia  acetylene  ethane  propane  phosphine and methane have been detected in saturn s the upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals  while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (nh4sh)  or ultraviolet radiation from the sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere  leading to a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion  this photochemical cycle is modulated by saturn s annual seasonal atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to jupiter s  but saturn s bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator  the nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on jupiter  saturn s finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the voyager spacecraft during the 1980s.  since then  earth-based  telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure  in the upper cloud layers  with the temperature in the range 100–160  k and pressures extending between 0.5–2  bar  the clouds consist of ammonia ice  water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5  bar and extend down to 9.5  bar  where temperatures range from 185–270  k  intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice  lying in the pressure range 3–6  bar with temperatures of 190–235  k  finally  the lower layers  where pressures are between 10–20  bar and temperatures are 270–330  k  contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long-lived  ovals and other features common on jupiter  in 1990,  the hubble space telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near saturn s equator that was not present during the voyager encounters  and in 1994  another smaller storm was observed  the 1990  storm was an example of a great white spot  a unique but short-lived  phenomenon that occurs once every saturnian year  roughly every 30  earth years  around the time of the northern hemisphere s summer previous great white spots were observed in 1876,  1903,  1933  and 1960,  with the 1933  storm being the most famous  if the periodicity is maintained  another storm will occur in about winds on saturn are the second fastest among the solar system s planets  after neptune s  voyager data indicate peak easterly winds of 500  m s (1800  in images from the cassini spacecraft during 2007,  saturn s northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue  similar to uranus  the color was most likely caused by rayleigh thermography has shown that saturn s south pole has a warm polar vortex  the only known example of such a phenomenon in the solar

structure rotates with a period of 10h  39m  24s   the same period as that of the planet s radio emissions  which is assumed to be equal to the period of rotation of saturn s the hexagonal feature does not shift in longitude like the other clouds in the visible the pattern s origin is a matter of much speculation  most scientists think it is a standing wave pattern in the atmosphere  polygonal shapes have been replicated in the laboratory through differential rotation of imaging of the south polar region indicates the presence of a jet stream  but no strong polar vortex nor any hexagonal standing nasa reported in november 2006  that cassini had observed a "hurricane-like"  storm locked to the south pole that had a clearly defined eyewall clouds had not previously been seen on any planet other than earth  for example  images from the galileo spacecraft did not show an eyewall in the great red spot of south pole storm may have been present for billions of this vortex is comparable to the size of earth  and it has winds of 550  has observed a series of cloud features nicknamed  string of pearls  found in northern latitudes  these features are cloud clearings that reside in deeper cloud has an intrinsic magnetic field that has a simple  symmetric shape – a magnetic dipole  its strength at the equator – 0.2  gauss (20  µt  – is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around jupiter and slightly weaker than earth s magnetic as a result  saturn s magnetosphere is much smaller than when voyager 2  entered the magnetosphere  the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19  saturn radii  or 1.1  million km (712,000  although it enlarged within several hours  and remained so for about three most probably  the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of jupiter – by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen  layer called a metallic-hydrogen  this magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the sun  the moon titan orbits within the outer part of saturn s magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in titan s outer saturn s magnetosphere  like earth s  produces average distance between saturn and the sun is over 1.4  billion kilometers (9  au   with an average orbital speed of 9.68  it takes saturn 10,759  earth days  or about 29  1⁄2  to finish one revolution

on saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions  as in jupiter s case  astronomers use three different systems for specifying the rotation rate of saturn  system i has a period of 10  hr 14  min 00  sec (844.3°/d)  and encompasses the equatorial zone  the south equatorial belt and the north equatorial belt  the polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to system i  all other saturnian latitudes  excluding the north and south polar regions  are indicated as system ii and have been assigned a rotation period of 10  hr 38  min 25.4  sec (810.76°/d).  system iii refers to saturn s internal rotation rate  based on radio emissions from the planet in the period of the voyager flybys  it has been assigned a rotation period of 10  hr 39  min 22.4  sec (810.8°/d).  because it is close to system ii  it has largely superseded precise value for the rotation period of the interior remains elusive  while approaching saturn in 2004,  cassini found that the radio rotation period of saturn had increased appreciably  to approximately 10  hr 45  min 45  sec  ± 36  the latest estimate of saturn s rotation  as an indicated rotation rate for saturn as a whole  based on a compilation of various measurements from the cassini  voyager and pioneer probes was reported in september 2007  is 10  hr 32  min 35  march 2007,  it was found that the variation of radio emissions from the planet did not match saturn s rotation rate  this variance may be caused by geyser activity on saturn s moon enceladus  the water vapor emitted into saturn s orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon saturn s magnetic field  slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the

is the only satellite in the solar system with a major in which a complex organic chemistry occurs  it is the only satellite with hydrocarbon 6  june 2013,  scientists at the iaa-csic  reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of titan  a possible precursor for on 23  june 2014,  nasa claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of titan came from materials in the oort cloud  associated with comets  and not from the materials that formed saturn in earlier moon enceladus  which seems similar in chemical makeup to has often been regarded as a potential habitat for microbial evidence of this possibility includes the satellite s salt-rich  particles having an "ocean-like"  composition that indicates most of enceladus s expelled ice comes from the evaporation of liquid salt a 2015  flyby by cassini through a plume on enceladus found most of the ingredients to sustain life forms that live by april 2014,  nasa scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon within the a ring  which was imaged by cassini on 15  april is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually the rings extend from 6,630  km to 120,700  km outward from saturn s equator  average approximately 20  meters in thickness and are composed of 93%  water ice with traces of tholin impurities and 7%  amorphous the particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10  while the other gas giants also have ring systems  saturn s is the largest and most visible there are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of the rings  one hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of saturn  the second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which saturn formed  some ice in the e ring comes from the moon enceladus s the past  astronomers once thought the rings formed alongside the planet when it formed billions of years instead  the age of these planetary rings is probably some hundreds of millions of the main rings at a distance of 12  million km from the planet is the sparse phoebe ring  which is tilted at an angle of 27°  to the other rings and  like phoebe  orbits in retrograde of the moons of saturn  including pandora and prometheus  act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and prevent them from spreading pan and atlas cause weak  linear density waves in saturn s rings that have yielded more reliable calculations of their have been three main phases in the observation and exploration of saturn  the first era was ancient observations  such as with the naked eye   before the invention of the modern telescopes  starting in the 17th  century progressively more advanced telescopic observations from earth have been made  the other type is visitation by spacecraft  either by orbiting or flyby  in the 21st  century observations continue from the earth  or earth-orbiting  observatories  and from the cassini orbiter at saturn saturn has been known since prehistoric in ancient times  it was the most distant of the known planets in the solar system and thus a major character in various mythologies  babylonian astronomers systematically observed and recorded the movements of in ancient roman mythology  the god saturnus  from which the planet takes its name  was the god of the romans considered saturnus the equivalent of the greek god the greeks had made the outermost planet sacred to and the romans followed suit   in modern greek  the planet retains its ancient name cronus—κρόνος  greek scientist ptolemy based his calculations of saturn s orbit on observations he made while it was in in hindu astrology  there are nine astrological objects  known as navagrahas  saturn is known as  shani  and judges everyone based on the good and bad deeds performed in ancient chinese and japanese culture designated the planet saturn as the  earth star   土星   this was based on five elements which were traditionally used to classify natural ancient hebrew  saturn is called its angel is cassiel  its intelligence or beneficial spirit is agiel  layga  and its spirit  darker aspect  is zazel  lzaz   in ottoman turkish  urdu and malay  its name is  zuhal   derived from arabic زحل saturn s rings require at least a 15-mm-diameter  to resolve and thus were not known to exist until galileo first saw them in he thought of them as two moons on saturn s it was not until christiaan huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted  huygens discovered saturn s moon titan  giovanni domenico cassini later discovered four other moons  iapetus  rhea  tethys and dione  in 1675,  cassini discovered the gap now known as the cassini further discoveries of significance were made until 1789  when william herschel discovered two further moons  mimas and enceladus  the irregularly shaped satellite hyperion  which has a resonance with titan  was discovered in 1848  by a british 1899  william henry pickering discovered phoebe  a highly irregular satellite that does not rotate synchronously with saturn as the larger moons phoebe was the first such satellite found and it takes more than a year to orbit saturn in a retrograde orbit  during the early 20th  century  research on titan led to the confirmation in 1944  that it had a thick atmosphere – a feature unique among the solar system s 11  made the first flyby of saturn in september 1979,  when it passed within 20,000  km of the planet s cloud tops  images were taken of the planet and a few of its moons  although their resolution was too low to discern surface detail  the spacecraft also studied saturn s rings  revealing the thin f-ring  and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at high phase angle  towards the sun   meaning that they contain fine light-scattering  material  in addition  pioneer 11  measured the temperature of november 1980,  the voyager 1  probe visited the saturn system  it sent back the first high-resolution  images of the planet  its rings and satellites  surface features of various moons were seen for the first time  voyager 1  performed a close flyby of titan  increasing knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon  it proved that titan s atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths  therefore no surface details were seen  the flyby changed the spacecraft s trajectory out from the plane of the solar a year later  in august 1981,  voyager 2  continued the study of the saturn system  more close-up  images of saturn s moons were acquired  as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings  unfortunately  during the flyby  the probe s turnable camera platform stuck for a couple of days and some planned imaging was lost  saturn s gravity was used to direct the spacecraft s trajectory towards probes discovered and confirmed several new satellites orbiting near or within the planet s rings  as well as the small maxwell gap  a gap within the c ring  and keeler gap  a 42  km wide gap in the a ring  on 1  july 2004,  the cassini–huygens space probe performed the soi  saturn orbit insertion  maneuver and entered orbit around saturn  before the soi  cassini had already studied the system extensively  in june 2004,  it had conducted a close flyby of phoebe  sending back high-resolution  images and data  cassini s flyby of saturn s largest moon  titan  has captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains  the orbiter completed two titan flybys before releasing the huygens probe on 25  december 2004.  huygens descended onto the surface of titan on 14  january 2005,  sending a flood of data during the atmospheric descent and after the cassini has since conducted multiple flybys of titan and other icy satellites starting in early 2005,  scientists used cassini to track lightning on saturn  the power of the lightning is approximately 1,000  times that of lightning on 2006,  nasa reported that cassini had found evidence of liquid water reservoirs that erupt in geysers on saturn s moon enceladus  images had shown jets of icy particles being emitted into orbit around saturn from vents in the moon s south polar region  according to andrew ingersoll  california institute of technology   other moons in the solar system have liquid-water  oceans covered by kilometers of icy crust  what s different here is that pockets of liquid water may be no more than tens of meters below the over 100  geysers have been identified on in may 2011,  nasa scientists at an enceladus focus group conference reported that enceladus  is emerging as the most habitable spot beyond earth in the solar system for life as we know photographs have led to other significant discoveries  they have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring  outside the brighter main rings of saturn and inside the g and e rings  the source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off janus and in july 2006,  cassini images provided evidence of hydrocarbon lakes near titan s north pole  the presence of which were confirmed in january 2007.  in march 2007,  additional images near titan s north pole revealed hydrocarbon seas  the largest of which is almost the size of the caspian in october 2006,  the probe detected an 8,000  km diameter cyclone-like  storm with an eyewall at saturn s south 2004  to 2  november 2009,  the probe discovered and confirmed eight new satellites  its primary mission ended in 2008  when the spacecraft had completed 74  orbits around the planet  the probe s mission was extended to september 2010  and then extended again to 2017,  to study a full period of saturn s april 2013  cassini sent back images of a hurricane at the planet s north pole 20  times larger than those found on earth  with winds faster than 530  19  july 2013,   the day the earth smiled   cassini was pointed towards earth to capture an image of the earth and the moon  and  as well  venus and mars  as part of a natural light  multi-image  portrait of the entire saturn system  it was the first time nasa informed the people of earth that a long-distance  photo was being taken in 15  september 2017,  the cassini-huygens  spacecraft performed the  grand finale  of its mission  a number of passes through gaps between saturn and saturn s inner the atmospheric entry of cassini ended the mission the continued exploration of saturn is still considered to be a viable option for nasa as part of their ongoing new frontiers program of missions  nasa previously requested for plans to be put forward for a mission to saturn that included an atmospheric entry probe and possible investigations into the habitability and possible discovery of life on saturn s moons titan and is the most distant of the five planets easily visible to the naked eye from earth  the other four being mercury  venus  mars and jupiter   uranus and occasionally 4  vesta are visible to the naked eye in dark skies   saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright  yellowish point of light with an apparent magnitude of usually between +1  and 0.  it takes approximately 29.5  years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac  most people will require an optical aid  very large binoculars or a small telescope  that magnifies at least 30  times to achieve an image of saturn s rings  in which clear resolution is twice every saturnian year  roughly every 15  earth years   the rings briefly disappear from view  due to the way in which they are angled and because they are so thin  such a  disappearance  will next occur in 2025,  but saturn will be too close to the sun for any ring-crossing  observation to be and its rings are best seen when the planet is at  or near  opposition  the configuration of a planet when it is at an elongation of 180°,  and thus appears opposite the sun in the sky  a saturnian opposition occurs every year—approximately every 378  days—and results in the planet appearing at its brightest  both the earth and saturn orbit the sun on eccentric orbits  which means their distances from the sun vary over time  and therefore so do their distances from each other  hence varying the brightness of saturn from one opposition to the next  saturn also appears brighter when the rings are angled such that they are more visible  for example  during the opposition of 17  december 2002,  saturn appeared at its brightest due to a favorable orientation of its rings relative to the even though saturn was closer to the earth and sun in late time to time saturn is occulted by the moon  that is  the moon covers up saturn in the sky   as with all the planets in the solar system  occultations of saturn occur in  seasons   saturnian occultations will take place 12  or more times over a 12-month  period  followed by about a five-year  period in which no such activity is australian astronomy experts hill and horner explain the seasonal nature of saturnian occultations this is the result of the fact that the moon’s orbit around the earth is tilted to the orbit of the earth around the sun – and so most of the time  the moon will pass above or below saturn in the sky  and no occultation will occur  it is only when saturn lies near the point that the moon’s orbit crosses the  plane of the ecliptic  that occultations can happen – and then they occur every time the moon swings by  until saturn moves away from the crossing system → local interstellar cloud → local bubble → gould belt → orion arm → milky way → milky way subgroup → local group → virgo supercluster → laniakea
