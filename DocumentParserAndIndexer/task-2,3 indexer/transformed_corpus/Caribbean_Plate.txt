 the caribbean plate is a mostly oceanic tectonic plate underlying central america and the caribbean sea off the north coast of south america roughly 3.2  million square kilometers (1.2  million square miles  in area  the caribbean plate borders the north american plate  the south american plate  the nazca plate and the cocos plate  these borders are regions of intense seismic activity  including frequent earthquakes  occasional and volcanic eruptions the northern boundary with the north american plate is a transform or strike-slip  boundary which runs from the border area of belize  guatemala  motagua fault   and honduras in central america  eastward through the cayman trough on south of the southeast coast of cuba  and just north of hispaniola  puerto rico  and the virgin islands  part of the puerto rico trench  the deepest part of the atlantic ocean  roughly 8,400  meters   lies along this border  the puerto rico trench is at a complex transition from the subduction boundary to the south and the transform boundary to the west the eastern boundary is a subduction zone  the lesser antilles subduction zone  where oceanic crust of the south american plate is being subducted under the caribbean plate  subduction forms the volcanic islands of the lesser antilles volcanic arc from the virgin islands in the north to the islands off the coast of venezuela in the south  this boundary contains seventeen active volcanoes  most notably soufriere hills on montserrat  mount pelée on martinique  la grande soufrière on guadeloupe  soufrière saint vincent on saint vincent  and the submarine volcano kick  em jenny which lies about 10  km north of grenada  large historical earthquakes in 1839  and 1843  in this region are possibly megathrust the geologically complex southern the caribbean plate interacts with the south american plate forming barbados  trinidad and tobago  all on the caribbean plate   and islands off the coast of venezuela  including the leeward antilles  and colombia  this boundary is in part the result of transform faulting along with thrust faulting and some subduction  the rich venezuelan petroleum fields possibly result from this complex plate interaction  the caribbean plate is moving eastward about 22  millimeters per year in relation to the south american in venezuela much of the movement between the caribbean plate and the south american plate occurs along the faults of boconó  el pilar and san western portion of the plate is occupied by central america  the cocos plate in the pacific ocean is subducted beneath the caribbean plate  just off the western coast of central america  this subduction forms the volcanoes of guatemala  el salvador  nicaragua  and costa rica  also known as the central america volcanic arc the usual theory as to the origin of the caribbean plate was confronted by a contrasting theory in 2002.the  mainstream theory holds that it is the caribbean large igneous province  clip  which formed in the pacific ocean tens of millions of years ago  as the atlantic ocean widened  north america and south america were pushed westward  separated for a time by oceanic the pacific ocean floor subducted under this oceanic crust between the continents  the clip drifted into the same area  but as it was less dense and thicker than the surrounding oceanic crust  it did not subduct  but rather overrode the ocean floor  continuing to move eastward relative to north america and south america  with the formation of the isthmus of panama 3  million years ago  it ultimately lost its connection to the pacific the more recent theory asserts that the caribbean plate came into being from an atlantic hotspot which no longer exists  this theory points to evidence of the absolute motion of the caribbean plate which indicates that it moves westward  not east  and that its apparent eastward motion is only relative to the motions of the north american plate and the south american caribbean plate began its eastward migration 80  million years ago  ma  during the late cretaceous  this migration eventually resulted in a volcanic arc stretching from north-western  south america to the yucatán peninsula  today represented by the aves islands and the lesser and greater antilles  this arc was the subject of constant tectonism and sea-level  fluctuations but lasted until the mid-eocene  and intermittently formed a land bridge along the eastern and northern boundaries of the caribbean  what would eventually become present-day  central america  part of the western plate boundary  was still isolated in the pacific.)58.5  to 56.5  ma  during the late paleocene  a local sea-level  low-stand  assisted by the continental uplift of the western margin of south america  resulted in a fully operative land bridge over which several groups of mammals apparently took part in an interchange  for example  xenarthrans are known from the itaboraian stage of the south american land mammal age  salma  (59–57  ma   palaeanodonts from the tiffanian north american land mammal age  nalma  (57  ma  and eurotamandua from the early middle eocene (50  ma  of europe  opossums are known from the tiupampan itaboraian salma (64–57  ma   from the clarkforkian nalma (55  ma   and from the ypresian in europe (55  great american interchange in which land and freshwater fauna migrated between north america and south america via the uplifted western margin of the caribbean plate  central america  was a later event  which peaked dramatically around three million years  ma  ago during the piacenzian age
