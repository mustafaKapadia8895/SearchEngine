 slavery in great britain existed and was recognized from before the roman occupation until the 12th  century  when chattel slavery disappeared after the norman conquest  former slaves merged into the larger body of serfs in britain and no longer were recognized separately in law or the 17th  century until well into the 19th  century  transportation to the colonies as a criminal or an indentured servant served as punishment for both major and petty crimes in england and ireland  during the same period  workhouses employed people whose poverty left them no other alternative than to work under forced labour conditions british merchants were among the largest participants in the atlantic slave trade  ship owners transported enslaved west africans to the new world to be sold into slave labour  the ships brought commodities back to britain then exported goods to africa  after a long campaign for abolition led by william wilberforce  parliament prohibited the practice by passing the slave trade act 1807  which was enforced by the royal navy s west africa squadron  britain used its influence to persuade other countries around the world to abolish the slave trade and sign treaties to allow the royal navy to interdict their case in 1772  held that no slave could be forcibly removed from britain  this case was generally taken at the time to have decided that the condition of slavery did not exist under english law  and emancipated the remaining ten to fourteen thousand slaves or possible slaves in england and wales  who were mostly domestic however slavery elsewhere in the british empire was not affected  joseph knight s case in 1778  established a similar position in scots law  slavery was abolished throughout the british empire by the slavery abolition act 1833,  with exceptions provided for the east india company  ceylon  and saint helena  these exceptions were eliminated in prohibition on slavery and servitude is now codified under article 4  of the european convention on human rights  incorporated into united kingdom law by the human rights act 1998  and republic of ireland law by the european convention on human rights act 2003.  article 4  of the convention also bans forced or compulsory labour  with some exceptions such as a criminal penalty or military service from before roman times  slavery was normal in britannia  with slaves being routinely slavery continued as an accepted part of society under the roman empire and after  anglo-saxons  continued the slave system  sometimes in league with norse traders often selling slaves to

wessex stated that anyone selling his own countryman  whether bond or free  across the sea  was to pay his own weregild in penalty  even when the man so sold was guilty of legal penalties and economic pressures that led to default in payments maintained the supply of slaves  and in the 11th  century there was still a slave trade operating out of bristol  as a passage in the vita wulfstani makes to the domesday book census  over 10%  of england s population in 1086  were in 1102,  the church council of london convened by anselm issued a decree   let no one dare hereafter to engage in the infamous business  prevalent in england  of selling men like however  the council had no legislative powers  and no act of law was valid unless signed by the monarch the influence of the new norman aristocracy led to the decline of slavery in england  contemporary writers noted that the scottish and welsh took captives as slaves during raids  a practice which was no longer common in england by the 12th  century  however  by the start of the 13th  century references to people being taken as slave stopped  while there was no legislation against slavery in ireland and william the conqueror introduced a law preventing the sale of slaves according to historian john gillingham  by about 1200  slavery in the british isles was to the colonies as a criminal or an indentured servant served as punishment for both major and petty crimes in england and ireland from the 17th  century until well into the 19th  century  a sentence could be for life or a specific period  the penal system required convicts to work on government projects such as road construction  building works and mining  or be assigned to free individuals as unpaid labour  women were expected to work as domestic servants and farm labourers  similar to slaves  indentured servants could be bought and sold  could not marry without the permission of their owner  were subject to physical punishment  and saw their obligation to labour enforced by the courts  however  they did retain certain heavily restricted rights  this contrasts with slaves who had none  a convict who had served part of his time might apply for a  ticket of leave  permitting some prescribed freedoms  this enabled some convicts to resume a more normal life  to marry and raise a family  and a few to develop the colonies while removing them from the society  exile was an essential component and thought to be a major deterrent to crime  transportation was also seen as a humane and productive alternative to execution  which would most likely have been the sentence for many if transportation had not been introduced the transportation of british subjects overseas can be traced back to the english vagabonds act 1597.  during the reign of henry viii  it has been estimated that approximately 72,000  people were put to death for a variety of an alternate practice  borrowed from the spanish  was to commute the death sentence and allow the use of convicts as a labour force for the colonies  one of the first references to a person being transported comes in 1607  when ‘ an apprentice dyer was sent to virginia  from bridewell for running away with his master s the act was little used despite attempts by james i who  with limited success  tried to encourage its adoption by passing a series of privy council orders in 1615,  1619  and was seldom used as a criminal sentence until the piracy act 1717,   an act for the further preventing robbery  burglary  and other felonies  and for the more effectual transportation of felons  and unlawful exporters of wool  and for declaring the law upon some points relating to pirates   established a seven-year  penal transportation as a possible punishment for those convicted of lesser felonies  or as a possible sentence that capital punishment might be commuted to by royal pardon  transportation of criminals to north america was undertaken from 1718  to 1776.  when the american revolution made it unfeasible to carry out transportation to the thirteen colonies  those sentenced to it were typically punished with imprisonment or hard labour instead  from 1787  to 1868,  criminals convicted and sentenced under the act were transported to the colonies in australia following the irish uprising in 1641  and subsequent cromwellian invasion  the english parliament passed the act for the settlement of ireland 1652  which classified the irish population into one of several categories according to their degree of involvement in the uprising and subsequent war  those who had participated in the uprising or assisted the rebels in any way were sentenced to be hanged and to have their property confiscated  other categories were sentenced to banishment with whole or partial confiscation of their estates  while the majority of the resettlement took place within ireland to the province of connaught  perhaps as many as 50,000  were transported to the colonies in the west indies and in north during the early colonial period  the scots and the english  along with other western european nations  dealt with their  gypsy problem  by transporting them as slaves in large numbers to north america and the caribbean  cromwell shipped romanichal gypsies as slaves to the southern plantations and there is documentation of gypsies being owned by former black slaves in before the highland clearances  some chiefs  such as ewen cameron of lochiel  sold some of their clans into indenture in north america  his goal was to alleviate over-population  and lack of food resources in his glens numerous highland jacobite supporters  captured in the aftermath of culloden and rigorous government sweeps of the highlands  were imprisoned on ships on the river thames  some were sentenced to transportation to the carolinas as indentured a period in the history of coal mining in scotland  miners were bonded to their  maisters  by a 1606  act  anent coalyers and salters   a colliers and salters  scotland  act 1775,  stated that  many colliers and salters are in a state of slavery and bondage  and announced emancipation  those starting work after 1  july 1775  would not become slaves  while those already in a state of slavery could  after 7  or 10  years depending on their age  apply for a decree of the sheriff s court granting their freedom  few could afford this  until a further law in 1799  established their freedom and made this slavery and bondage the 17th  century to the 19th  century  workhouses took in people whose poverty left them no other alternative  they were employed under forced labour conditions  workhouses took in abandoned babies  usually presumed to be illegitimate  when they grew old enough  they were used as child labour  charles dickens represented such issues in his fiction  a life example was henry morton stanley  this was a time when many children worked  if families were poor  everyone worked  only in 1833  and 1844  were the first general protective laws against child labour  the factory acts  passed in the 16th  to the 19th  centuries it is estimated that between 1  million and 1.25  million europeans were captured by

grievances against charles i and presented to him in 1641,  contains the following complaint about barbary pirates of the ottoman empire abducting english people into slavery admiral sir john hawkins of plymouth  a notable elizabethan seafarer  is widely acknowledged to be  the pioneer of the english slave trade   in 1554–1555,  hawkins formed a slave trading syndicate of wealthy merchants  he sailed with three ships for the caribbean via sierra leone  hijacked a portuguese slave ship and sold the 300  slaves from it in santo domingo  during a second voyage in 1564,  his crew captured 400  africans and sold them at rio de la hacha in present-day  colombia  making a 60%  profit for his financiers  a third voyage involved both buying slaves directly in africa and capturing a portuguese ship with its cargo  upon reaching the caribbean  hawkins sold all the slaves  on his return  he published a book entitled an alliance to raid for slaves  britain soon became the leader in the atlantic slave needed by the mid 18th  century  london had the largest black population in britain  made up of free and enslaved people  as well as many runaways  the total number may have been about was regarded as fashionable amongst the upper classes to have a black servant and they sometimes feature in paintings  such as  the family of sir william young   circa 1768  by zoffany  there were black people in many towns  such as liverpool  bristol  bath and lancaster  smaller number of black people were also found in rural areas throughout the country  number of black people achieved prominence  ignatius sancho (1729–1780)  opened his own grocer s shop in westminster  he wrote poetry and music and his friends included the novelist laurence sterne  david garrick the actor and the duke and duchess of montague  he is best known for his letters which were published after his death  others such as olaudah equiano and ottobah cugoano were active in the abolition campaigns the legal status of enslaved people in europe was often unclear  in britain it was not finally resolved until abolition in 1838,  though after the famous somerset case in 1772  enslaved people could not be sent back to the colonies against their the 18th  century  the slave trade became a major economic mainstay for such cities as bristol  liverpool and glasgow  engaged in the so-called   triangular trade   the ships set out from britain  loaded with trade goods which were exchanged on the west african shores for slaves captured by local rulers from deeper inland  the slaves were transported through the infamous  middle passage  across the atlantic  and were sold at considerable profit for labour in plantations  the ships were loaded with export crops and commodities  the products of slave labour  such as sugar and rum  and returned to britain to sell the items the isle of man was involved in the transatlantic african slave trade  goods from the slave trade were bought and sold on the isle of man  and manx merchants  seamen  and ships were involved in the locke  the philosophical champion of the glorious revolution argued against slavery  ch iv  and asserted that  every man has property in his own person  (§27,  ch v   by the 18th  century african slaves began to be brought into london and edinburgh as personal needed  in a number of judicial decisions between slave merchants  it was tacitly accepted that slavery of africans was needed  in butts v  penny (1677)  2  lev 201,  3  keb 785,  an action was brought to recover the value of 10  slaves who had been held by the plaintiff in india  the court held that an action for trover would lie in english law  because the sale of non-christians  as slaves was common in india  however  no judgment was delivered in the english court case of 1569  involving cartwright who had bought a slave from russia ruled that english law could not recognise slavery  this ruling was overshadowed by later developments particularly in the navigation acts  but was upheld by the lord chief justice in 1701  when he ruled that a slave became free as soon as he arrived in england  agitation saw a series of judgments repulse the tide of slavery  in smith v  gould (1705–07)  2  salk 666,  holt cj stated that bythe common law no man can have a property in another but in 1729  the then-attorney  general and solicitor general of england signed the yorke–talbot slavery opinion expressing their view  and  by implication  that of the government  that slavery of africans was lawful in england  at this time slaves were openly bought and sold on commodities markets at london and liverpool  slavery was also accepted in britain s many colonies lord henley lc said in shanley v  harvey (1763)  2  eden 126,  127  that assoon as a man sets

somersett escaped  captain knowles captured him and took him on his boat  jamaica bound  three abolitionists  saying they were his  godparents   applied for a writ of habeas corpus  one of somersett s lawyers  francis hargrave  stated  in 1569,  during the reign of queen elizabeth i  a lawsuit was brought against a man for beating another man he had bought as a slave overseas  the record states   that in the 11th  of elizabeth one cartwright brought a slave from russia and would scourge him  for which he was questioned  and it was resolved  that england was too pure an air for a slave to breathe in    he argued that the court had ruled in cartwright s case that english common law made no provision for slavery  and without a basis for its legality  slavery would otherwise be unlawful as false imprisonment and or in his judgment of 22  june 1772,  lord chief justice william murray  lord mansfield  of the court of king s bench  started by talking about the capture and forcible detention of somersett  he finished with so high an act of dominion must be recognized by the law of the country where it is used  the power of a master over his slave has been exceedingly different  in different countries the state of slavery is of such a nature  that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons  moral or political  but only by positive law  which preserves its force long after the reasons  occasion  and time itself from whence it was created  is erased from memory it is so odious  that nothing can be suffered to support it  but positive law  whatever inconveniences  therefore  may follow from the decision  i cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of england  and therefore the black must be different reports of mansfield s decision appeared  most disagree as to what was said  the decision was only given orally  no formal written record of it was issued by the court  abolitionists widely circulated the view that it was declared that the condition of slavery did not exist under english law  although mansfield later said that all that he decided was that a slave could not be forcibly removed from england against his reading about somersett s case  joseph knight  an enslaved african who had been purchased by his master john wedderburn in jamaica and brought to scotland  left him  married and with a child  he filed a freedom suit  on the grounds that he could not be held as a slave in great britain  in the case of knight v  wedderburn (1778),  wedderburn said that knight owed him  perpetual servitude   the court of sessions of scotland ruled against him  saying that chattel slavery was not recognised under the law of scotland  and slaves could seek court protection to leave a master or avoid being forcibly removed from scotland to be returned to slavery in the wilberforce  a member of the house of commons as an independent  became intricately involved in the abolition of the slave trade in britain  his conversion to evangelical christianity in 1784  played a key role in interesting him in this social william wilberforce s slave trade act 1807  abolished the slave trade in the british empire  it was not until the slavery abolition act 1833  that the institution finally was abolished  but on a gradual basis  since land owners in the british west indies were losing their unpaid labourers  they received compensation totaling £20  royal navy established the west africa squadron  or preventative squadron  at substantial expense in 1808  after parliament passed the slave trade act of 1807.  the squadron s task was to suppress the atlantic slave trade by patrolling the coast of west africa  preventing the slave trade by force of arms  including the interception of slave ships from europe  the

among those they paid were the bishop of exeter and three business colleagues  who received compensation for 665  and economists have debated the economic effects of slavery for great britain and the north american colonies  many analysts suggest that it allowed the formation of capital that financed the industrial revolution  although the evidence is inconclusive  slave labour was integral to early settlement of the colonies  which needed more people for labour and other work  also  slave labour produced the major consumer goods that were the basis of world trade during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries  coffee  cotton  rum  sugar  and tobacco  slavery was far more important to the profitability of plantations and the economy in the american south  and the slave trade and associated businesses were important to both new york and new 2006,  the then british prime minister  tony blair  expressed his deep sorrow over the slave trade  which he described as  profoundly some campaigners had demanded reparations from the former slave trading
