 the effects of global warming are the environmental and social changes caused  directly or indirectly  by human emissions of greenhouse gases  there is a scientific consensus that climate change is occurring  and that human activities are the primary many impacts of climate change have already been observed  including glacier changes in the timing of seasonal  e g   earlier flowering of and changes in agricultural effects of climate change will vary depending on climate change and social the two main policies to address climate change are reducing human greenhouse gas emissions  climate change mitigation  and adapting to the impacts of climate geoengineering is another policy climate change policies could significantly affect long-term  climate change stringent mitigation policies might be able to limit global warming  in 2100)  to around 2  °c or below  relative to pre-industrial  without mitigation  increased energy demand and extensive use of fossil might lead to global warming of around 4  higher magnitudes of global warming would be more difficult to adapt and would increase the risk of negative this article   climate change  means a change in climate that persists over a sustained period of the world meteorological organization defines this time period as 30  examples of climate change include increases in global surface temperature  global warming   changes in rainfall patterns  and changes in the frequency of extreme weather events  changes in climate may be due to natural causes  e g   changes in the sun s output  or due to human activities  e g   changing the composition of the any human-induced  changes in climate will occur against a background of natural climatic and of variations in human activity such as population growth on shores or in arid areas which increase or decrease climate the term  anthropogenic forcing  refers to the influence exerted on a habitat or chemical environment by humans  as opposed to a natural article breaks down some of the impacts of climate change according to different levels of future global warming  this way of describing impacts has  for instance  been used in the ipcc  intergovernmental panel on climate change  assessment reports on climate the instrumental temperature record shows global warming of around 0.6  °c during the 20th  future level of global warming is uncertain  but a wide range of estimates  projections  have been the ipcc s  sres  scenarios have been frequently used to make projections of future climate the sres scenarios are  baseline   or  reference   scenarios  which means that they do not take into account any current or future measures to limit ghg emissions  e g   the unfccc s kyoto protocol and the cancún emissions projections of the sres scenarios are broadly comparable in range to the baseline emissions scenarios that have been developed by the scientific the ipcc fourth assessment report  changes in future global mean temperature were projected using the six sres  marker  emissions emissions projections for the six sres  marker  scenarios are representative of the full set of forty sres for the lowest emissions sres marker scenario ("b1"  – see the sres article for details on this scenario   the best estimate for global mean temperature is an increase of 1.8  °c (3.2  by the end of the 21st  century  this projection is relative to global temperatures at the end of the 20th  the  likely  range  greater than 66%  probability  based on expert for the sres b1  marker scenario is 1.1–2.9  °c (2.0–5.2  for the highest emissions sres marker scenario (a1fi),  the best estimate for global mean temperature increase is 4.0  °c (7.2  °f   with a  likely  range of 2.4–6.4  °c (4.3–11.5  range in temperature projections partly reflects (1)  the choice of emissions scenario  and (2)  the  climate for (1),  different scenarios make different assumptions of future social and economic development  e g   economic growth  population level  energy policies   which in turn affects projections of greenhouse gas  ghg  the projected magnitude of warming by 2100  is closely related to the level of cumulative emissions over the 21st  century  i e  total emissions between the higher the cumulative emissions over this time period  the greater the level of warming is projected to reflects uncertainty in the response of the climate system to past and future ghg emissions  which is measured by the climate higher estimates of climate sensitivity lead to greater projected warming  while lower estimates of climate sensitivity lead to less projected the next several millennia  projections suggest that global warming could be even if emissions were drastically reduced  global temperatures would remain close to their highest level for at least 1,000  years  see the later section on have used various  proxy  data to assess past changes in earth s climate sources of proxy data include historical records  such as farmers  logs   tree rings  corals  fossil pollen  ice cores  and ocean and lake analysis of these data suggest that recent warming is unusual in the past 400  years  possibly by the end of the 21st  century  temperatures may increase to a level not experienced since the mid-pliocene,  around 3  million years at that time  models suggest that mean global temperatures were about 2–3  °c warmer than pre-industrial  even a 2  °c rise above the pre-industrial  level would be outside the range of temperatures experienced by human broad range of evidence shows that the climate system has evidence of global warming is shown in the graphs opposite  some of the graphs show a positive trend  e g   increasing temperature over land and the ocean  and sea level rise  other graphs show a negative trend  e g   decreased snow cover in the northern hemisphere  and declining arctic sea ice extent  evidence of warming is also apparent in living  biological  activities have contributed to a number of the observed changes in this contribution has principally been through the burning of fossil fuels  which has led to an increase in the concentration of ghgs in the another human influence on the climate are sulfur dioxide emissions  which are a precursor to the formation of sulfate aerosols in the warming could lead to large-scale,  irreversible  and or abrupt changes in physical an example of this is the melting of ice sheets  which contributes to sea level the probability of warming having unforeseen consequences increases with the rate  magnitude  and duration of climate show that there have been changes in as climate changes  the probabilities of certain types of weather events are affected changes have been observed in the amount  intensity  frequency  and type of widespread increases in heavy precipitation have occurred  even in places where total rain amounts have decreased  with medium confidence  see footnote 1),  ipcc concluded that human influences had contributed to an increase in heavy precipitation events at the global scale projections of future changes in precipitation show overall increases in the global average  but with substantial shifts in where and how precipitation projections suggest a reduction in rainfall in the subtropics  and an increase in precipitation in subpolar latitudes and some equatorial in other words  regions which are dry at present will in general become even drier  while regions that are currently wet will in general become even this projection does not apply to every locale  and in some cases can be modified by local most land areas since the 1950s,  it is very likely that there have been fewer or warmer cold days and hot days and nights have also very likely become warmer or more human activities have very likely contributed to these there may have been changes in other climate extremes  e g   floods  droughts and tropical cyclones  but these changes are more difficult to suggest changes in the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather confidence in projections varies over changes  e g   more frequent hot days  will probably be evident in the near term  while other near-term  changes  e g   more intense droughts and tropical cyclones  are more climate change will be associated with more very hot days and fewer very cold the frequency  length and intensity of heat waves will very likely increase over most land higher growth in anthropogenic ghg emissions will be associated with larger increases in the frequency and severity of temperature high growth in ghg emissions  ipcc scenario rcp8.5),  presently dry regions may be affected by an increase in the risk of drought and reductions in soil over most of the mid-latitude  land masses and wet tropical regions  extreme precipitation events will very likely become more intense and the global scale  the frequency of tropical cyclones will probably decrease or be global mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed and precipitation rates will likely changes in tropical cyclones will probably vary by region  but these variations are impacts of extreme events on the environment and human society will vary  some impacts will be beneficial—e g   fewer cold extremes will probably lead to fewer cold overall  however  impacts will probably be mostly cryosphere is made up of areas of the earth which are covered by snow or observed changes in the cryosphere include declines in arctic sea ice the widespread retreat of alpine and reduced snow cover in the northern et al  assessed the potential impacts of climate change on summertime arctic sea ice extent  assuming high growth in greenhouse gas emissions  sres a2),  some models projected that arctic sea ice in the summer could largely disappear by the end of the 21st  more recent projections suggest that the arctic summers could be ice-free   defined as ice extent less than 1  million square km  as early as the 21st  century  and snow cover are projected to continue their widespread in the western mountains of north america  increasing temperatures and changes in precipitation are projected to lead to reduced snowpack is the seasonal accumulation of slow-melting  the melting of the greenland and west antarctic ice sheets could contribute to sea level rise  especially over long time-scales   see the section on greenland and west antarctic ice in the cryosphere are projected to have social for example  in some regions  glacier retreat could increase the risk of reductions in seasonal water barnett et al  estimated that more than one-sixth  of the world s population rely on glaciers and snowpack for their water supply the role of the oceans in global warming is complex  the oceans serve as a sink for carbon dioxide  taking up much that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere  but increased levels of co 2  have led to ocean acidification  furthermore  as the temperature of the oceans increases  they become less able to absorb excess co 2.  the ocean have also acted as a sink in absorbing extra heat from the the increase in ocean heat content is much larger than any other store of energy in the earth’s heat balance over the two periods 1961  to 2003  and 1993  to 2003,  and accounts for more than 90%  of the possible increase in heat content of the earth system during these warming is projected to have a number of effects on the oceans  ongoing effects include rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets  and warming of the ocean surface  leading to increased temperature stratification  other possible effects include large-scale  changes in ocean circulation about one-third  of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activity has already been taken up by the as carbon dioxide dissolves in sea water  carbonic acid is formed  which has the effect of acidifying the ocean  measured as a change in ph  the uptake of human carbon emissions since the year 1750  has led to an average decrease in ph of 0.1  projections using the sres emissions scenarios suggest a further reduction in average global surface ocean ph of between 0.14  and 0.35  units over the 21st  century the effects of ocean acidification on the marine biosphere have yet to be laboratory experiments suggest beneficial effects for a few species  with potentially highly detrimental effects for a substantial number of with medium confidence  fischlin et al  projected that future ocean acidification and climate change would impair a wide range of planktonic and shallow benthic marine organisms that use aragonite to make their shells or skeletons  such as corals and marine snails  pteropods   with significant impacts particularly in the southern ocean the amount of oxygen dissolved in the oceans may decline  with adverse consequences for ocean is strong evidence that global sea level rose gradually over the 20th  with high confidence  bindoff et al  concluded that between the mid-19th  and mid-20th  centuries  the rate of sea level rise increased  authors of the ipcc fourth assessment synthesis report  ipcc ar4  syr  reported that between the years 1961  and 2003,  global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8  mm per year  mm yr   with a range of 1.3–2.3  mm yr  between 1993  and 2003,  the rate increased above the previous period to 3.1  mm yr  range of 2.4–3.8  mm yr   authors of ipcc ar4  syr were uncertain whether the increase in rate from 1993  to 2003  was due to natural variations in sea level over the time period  or whether it reflected an increase in the underlying long-term  trend there are two main factors that have contributed to observed sea level the first is thermal expansion  as ocean water warms  it the second is from the contribution of land-based  ice due to increased melting  the major store of water on land is found in glaciers and ice sheets  anthropogenic forces very likely  greater than 90%  probability  based on expert contributed to sea level rise during the latter half of the 20th  is a widespread consensus that substantial long-term  sea level rise will continue for centuries to in their fourth assessment report  the projected sea level rise to the end of the 21st  century using the sres emissions scenarios  across the six sres marker scenarios  sea level was projected to rise by 18  to 59  cm (7.1  to 23.2  in   relative to sea level at the end of the 20th  thermal expansion is the largest component in these projections  contributing 70–75%  of the central estimate for all due to a lack of scientific understanding  this sea level rise estimate does not include all of the possible contributions of ice sheets  see the section on greenland and west antarctic ice sheets  an assessment of the scientific literature on climate change was published in 2010  by the us national research council  us nrc  nrc described the projections in ar4   i e  those cited in the above paragraph  as  conservative   and summarized the results of more recent studies  cited studies suggested a great deal of uncertainty in a range of projections suggested possible sea level rise by the end of the 21st  century of between 0.56  and 2  m  relative to sea levels at the end of the 20th  1961  to 2003,  the global ocean temperature has risen by 0.10  °c from the surface to a depth of 700  m  there is variability both year-to-year  and over longer time scales  with global ocean heat content observations showing high rates of warming for 1991–2003,  but some cooling from 2003  to the temperature of the antarctic southern ocean rose by 0.17  °c (0.31  °f  between the 1950s  and the 1980s,  nearly twice the rate for the world s oceans as a as well as having effects on ecosystems  e g  by melting sea ice  affecting algae that grow on its underside   warming reduces the ocean s ability to absorb co needed  it is likely  greater than 66%  probability  based on expert that anthropogenic forcing contributed to the general warming observed in the upper several hundred metres of the ocean during the latter half of the 20th  effects of global warming vary in nature  some are the result of a generalised global change  such as rising temperature  resulting in local effects  such as melting ice  in other cases  a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system  in such cases  the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend there are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate  melting or forming ice  changing the hydrological cycle  of evaporation and precipitation  and changing currents in the oceans and air flows in the atmosphere  the coast can also be considered a region  and will suffer severe impacts from sea level rise with very high confidence  rosenzweig et al  concluded that physical and biological systems on all continents and in most oceans had been affected by recent climate changes  particularly regional temperature increases  impacts include earlier leafing of trees and plants over many regions  movements of species to higher latitudes and altitudes in the northern hemisphere  changes in bird migrations in europe  north america and australia  and shifting of the oceans  plankton and fish from cold-  to warm-adapted  human influence on the climate can be seen in the geographical pattern of observed warming  with greater temperature increases over land and in polar regions rather than over the using models  it is possible to identify the human  signal  of global warming over both land and ocean of future climate changes at the regional scale do not hold as high a level of scientific confidence as projections made at the global it is  however  expected that future warming will follow a similar geographical pattern to that seen already  with greatest warming over land and high northern latitudes  and least over the southern ocean and parts of the north atlantic nearly all land areas will very likely warm more than the global arctic  africa  small islands and asian megadeltas are regions that are likely to be especially affected by climate low-latitude,  less-developed  areas are at most risk of experiencing negative impacts due to climate developed countries are also vulnerable to climate for example  developed countries will be negatively affected by increases in the severity and frequency of some extreme weather events  such as heat in all regions  some people can be particularly at risk from climate change  such as the poor  young children and the impacts of climate change can be thought of in terms of sensitivity and vulnerability   sensitivity  is the degree to which a particular system or sector might be affected  positively or negatively  by climate change and or climate variability   vulnerability  is the degree to which a particular system or sector might be adversely affected by climate sensitivity of human society to climate change varies  sectors sensitive to climate change include water resources  coastal zones  human settlements  and human health  industries sensitive to climate change include agriculture  fisheries  forestry  energy  construction  insurance  financial services  tourism  and change will impact agriculture and food production around the world due to  the effects of elevated co2  in the atmosphere  higher temperatures  altered precipitation and transpiration regimes  increased frequency of extreme events  and modified weed  pest  and pathogen in general  low-latitude  areas are at most risk of having decreased crop of 2007,  the effects of regional climate change on agriculture have been changes in crop phenology provide important evidence of the response to recent regional climate phenology is the study of natural phenomena that recur periodically  and how these phenomena relate to climate and seasonal a significant advance in phenology has been observed for agriculture and forestry in large parts of the northern low to medium confidence  schneider et al  projected that for about a 1  to 3  °c increase in global mean temperature  by the years 2090–2100,  relative to average temperatures in the years 1990–2000),  there would be productivity decreases for some cereals in low latitudes  and productivity increases in high latitudes  with medium confidence  global production potential was projected of the studies on global agriculture assessed by schneider et al  had not incorporated a number of critical factors  including changes in extreme events  or the spread of pests and diseases  studies had also not considered the development of specific practices or technologies to aid adaptation to climate graphs opposite show the projected effects of climate change on selected crop actual changes in yields may be above or below these central projections above can be expressed relative to pre-industrial  (1750)  0.6  °c of warming is estimated to have occurred between 1750  and 1990–2000.  add 0.6  °c to the above projections to convert them from a 1990–2000  to pre-industrial  baseline easterling et al  assessed studies that made quantitative projections of climate change impacts on food security  it was noted that these projections were highly uncertain and had limitations  however  the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings  the first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of hunger compared with reference scenarios with no climate change  climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development  additionally  the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development  in 2006,  the global estimate for the number of people undernourished was 820  under the sres a1,  b1,  and b2  scenarios  see the sres article for information on each scenario group   projections for the year 2080  showed a reduction in the number of people undernourished of about 560–700  million people  with a global total of undernourished people of 100–240  million in 2080.  by contrast  the sres a2  scenario showed only a small decrease in the risk of hunger from 2006  levels  the smaller reduction under a2  was attributed to the higher projected future population level in this scenario some evidence suggests that droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in africa  southern europe  the middle east  most of the americas  australia  and southeast however  other research suggests that there has been little change in drought over the past 60  their impacts are aggravated because of increased water demand  population growth  urban expansion  and environmental protection efforts in many droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture grazing land for beings are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns  temperature  precipitation  sea-level  rise and more frequent extreme events  and indirectly through changes in water  air and food quality and changes in ecosystems  agriculture  industry and settlements and the economy  confalonieri et al   according to an assessment of the scientific literature by confalonieri et al  the effects of climate change to date have been small  but are projected to progressively increase in all countries and regions a study by the world health organization  who  estimated the effect of climate change on human health  not all of the effects of climate change were included in their estimates  for example  the effects of more frequent and extreme storms were excluded  climate change was estimated to have been responsible for 3%  of diarrhoea  3%  of malaria  and 3.8%  of dengue fever deaths worldwide in 2004.  total attributable mortality was about 0.2%  of deaths in 2004;  of these  85%  were child deaths with high confidence  authors of the ipcc ar4  synthesis projected that climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas  such as fewer deaths from cold exposure  and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of malaria in africa  benefits were projected to be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures  especially in developing countries with very high confidence  confalonieri et al  concluded that economic development was an important component of possible adaptation to climate change  economic growth on its own  however  was not judged to be sufficient to insulate the world s population from disease and injury due to climate change  future vulnerability to climate change will depend not only on the extent of social and economic change  but also on how the benefits and costs of change are distributed in for example  in the 19th  century  rapid urbanization in western europe lead to a plummeting in population other factors important in determining the health of populations include education  the availability of health services  and public-health  number of climate-related  trends have been observed that affect water resources  these include changes in precipitation  the crysosphere and surface waters  e g   changes in river observed and projected impacts of climate change on freshwater systems and their management are mainly due to changes in temperature  sea level and precipitation sea level rise will extend areas of salinization of groundwater and estuaries  resulting in a decrease in freshwater availability for humans and ecosystems in coastal areas  in an assessment of the scientific literature  kundzewicz et al  concluded  with high confidence  that general circulation models project that the future climate change will bring wetter coasts  drier mid-continent  areas  and further sea level such changes could result in the gravest effects of climate change through human millions might be displaced by shoreline erosions  river and coastal flooding  or severe drought migration related to climate change is likely to be predominantly from rural areas in developing countries to towns and in the short term climate stress is likely to add incrementally to existing migration patterns rather than generating entirely new flows of has been argued that environmental degradation  loss of access to resources  e g   water and resulting human migration could become a source of political and even military factors other than climate change may  however  be more important in affecting conflict  for example  wilbanks et al  suggested that major environmentally influenced conflicts in africa were more to do with the relative abundance of resources  e g   oil and diamonds  than with resource scarcity  scott et al  (2001)  placed only low confidence in predictions of increased conflict due to climate 2013  study found that significant climatic changes were associated with a higher risk of conflict worldwide  and predicted that  amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical social impact of anthropogenic climate change in both low-  and high-income  similarly  a 2014  study found that higher temperatures were associated with a greater likelihood of violent crime  and predicted that global warming would cause millions of such crimes in the united states alone during the 21st  planners are concerned that global warming is a  threat multiplier    whether it is poverty  food and water scarcity  diseases  economic instability  or threat of natural disasters  the broad range of changing climatic conditions may be far reaching  these challenges may threaten stability in much of the impacts adds up the total impact of climate change across sectors and or examples of aggregate measures include economic cost  e g   changes in gross domestic product  gdp  and the social cost of carbon   changes in ecosystems  e g   changes over land area from one type of vegetation to human health impacts  and the number of people affected by climate aggregate measures such as economic cost require researchers to make value judgements over the importance of impacts occurring in different regions and at different times global losses reveal rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather-related  events since the socio-economic  factors have contributed to the observed trend of global losses  e g   population growth  increased part of the growth is also related to regional climatic factors  e g   changes in precipitation and flooding events  it is difficult to quantify the relative impact of socio-economic  factors and climate change on the observed the trend does  however  suggest increasing vulnerability of social systems to climate total economic impacts from climate change are highly with medium confidence  smith et al  concluded that world gdp would change by plus or minus a few percent for a small increase in global mean temperature  up to around 2  °c relative to the 1990  temperature level   most studies assessed by smith et al  projected losses in world gdp for a medium increase in global mean temperature  above 2–3  °c relative to the 1990  temperature level   with increasing losses for greater temperature increases  this assessment is consistent with the findings of more recent studies  as reviewed by hitz and smith impacts are expected to vary for a medium increase in global mean temperature (2–3  °c of warming  relative to the average temperature between 1990–2000),  market sectors in low-latitude  and less-developed  areas might experience net costs due to climate on the other hand  market sectors in high-latitude  and developed regions might experience net benefits for this level of warming  a global mean temperature increase above about 2–3  °c  relative to 1990–2000)  would very likely result in market sectors across all regions experiencing either declines in net benefits or rises in net impacts have also been quantified in non-economic  terms  for example  climate change over the 21st  century is likely to adversely affect hundreds of millions of people through increased coastal flooding  reductions in water supplies  increased malnutrition and increased health very high confidence  rosenzweig et al  (2007)  concluded that recent warming had strongly affected natural biological hundreds of studies have documented responses of ecosystems  plants  and animals to the climate changes that have already for example  in the northern hemisphere  species are almost uniformly moving their ranges northward and up in elevation in search of cooler humans are very likely causing changes in regional temperatures to which plants and animals are the year 2100,  ecosystems will be exposed to atmospheric co 2  levels substantially higher than in the past 650,000  years  and global temperatures at least among the highest of those experienced in the past 740,000  significant disruptions of ecosystems are projected to increase with future climate examples of disruptions include disturbances such as fire  drought  pest infestation  invasion of species  storms  and coral bleaching events  the stresses caused by climate change  added to other stresses on ecological systems  e g   land conversion  land degradation  harvesting  and pollution   threaten substantial damage to or complete loss of some unique ecosystems  and extinction of some critically endangered change has been estimated to be a major driver of biodiversity loss in cool conifer forests  savannas  mediterranean-climate  systems  tropical forests  in the arctic tundra  and in coral in other ecosystems  land-use  change may be a stronger driver of biodiversity loss at least in the beyond the year 2050,  climate change may be the major driver for biodiversity loss literature assessment by fischlin et al  included a quantitative estimate of the number of species at increased risk of extinction due to climate change  with medium confidence  it was projected that approximately 20  to 30%  of plant and animal species assessed so far  in an unbiased sample  would likely be at increasingly high risk of extinction should global mean temperatures exceed a warming of 2  to 3  °c above pre-industrial  temperature the uncertainties in this estimate  however  are large  for a rise of about 2  °c the percentage may be as low as 10%,  or for about 3  °c  as high as 40%,  and depending on biota  all living organisms of an area  the flora and fauna considered as a the range is between 1%  and as global average temperature exceeds 4  °c above pre-industrial  levels  model projections suggested that there could be significant extinctions (40–70%  of species that were assessed  around the whether future changes in ecosystems will be beneficial or detrimental is largely based on how ecosystems are valued by human for increases in global average temperature exceeding 1.5  to 2.5  °c  relative to global temperatures over the years and in concomitant atmospheric co 2  concentrations  projected changes in ecosystems will have predominantly negative consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems goods and services  e g   water and food ecological and social systems may respond in an abrupt  non-linear  or irregular way to climate this is as opposed to a smooth or regular response  a quantitative entity behaves  irregularly  when its dynamics are discontinuous  i e   not smooth   nondifferentiable  unbounded  wildly varying  or otherwise such behaviour is often termed  singular   irregular behaviour in earth systems may give rise to certain thresholds  which  when crossed  may lead to a large change in the system some singularities could potentially lead to severe impacts at regional or global examples of "large-scale"  singularities are discussed in the articles on abrupt climate change  climate change feedback and runaway climate change  it is possible that human-induced  climate change could trigger large-scale  singularities  but the probabilities of triggering such events are  for the most poorly low to medium confidence  smith et al  concluded that a rapid warming of more than 3  °c above 1990  levels would exceed thresholds that would lead to large-scale  discontinuities in the climate system  since the assessment by smith et al  (2001),  improved scientific understanding provides more guidance for two large-scale  singularities  the role of carbon cycle feedbacks in future climate change  discussed below in the section on biogeochemical cycles  and the melting of the greenland and west antarctic ice change may have an effect on the carbon cycle in an interactive  feedback  process  a feedback exists where an initial process triggers changes in a second process that in turn influences the initial process  a positive feedback intensifies the original process  and a negative feedback reduces models suggest that the interaction of the climate system and the carbon cycle is one where the feedback effect is the a2  sres emissions scenario  schneider et al  found that this effect led to additional warming by the years 2090–2100   relative to the 1990–2000)  of 0.1–1.5  °c  this estimate was made with high confidence  the climate projections made in the ipcc fourth assessment report summarized earlier of 1.1–6.4  °c account for this feedback effect  on the other hand  with medium confidence  schneider et al  commented that additional releases of ghgs were possible from permafrost  peat lands  wetlands  and large stores of marine hydrates at high latitudes with medium confidence  authors of concluded that with a global average temperature increase of 1–4  °c  relative to temperatures over the years 1990–2000),  at least a partial deglaciation of the greenland ice sheet  and possibly the west antarctic ice sheets would occur  the estimated timescale for partial deglaciation was centuries to millennia  and would contribute 4  to 6  metres (13  to 20  ft  or more to sea level rise over this period the atlantic meridional overturning circulation  amoc  is an important component of the earth

 as well as over north america  although it is very unlikely  less than 10%  probability  based on expert that the amoc will collapse in the 21st  century  the potential consequences of such a collapse could be of ghgs are a potentially irreversible commitment to sustained radiative forcing in the the contribution of a ghg to radiative forcing depends on the gas s ability to trap infrared

some geoengineering options  such as blocking sunlight  would not prevent further ocean climate change may lead to irreversible impacts on physical  biological  and social there are a number of examples of climate change impacts that may be irreversible  at least over the timescale of many human these include the large-scale  singularities described above – changes in carbon cycle feedbacks  the melting of the greenland and west antarctic ice sheets  and changes to the in biological systems  the extinction of species would be an irreversible in social systems  unique cultures may be lost due to climate for example  humans living on atoll islands face risks due to sea-level  rise  sea-surface  warming  and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather some locations and industries global warming may increase productivity  though the ipcc cautions that  estimates agree on the size of the impact  small relative to economic growth   and 17  of the 20  impact estimates shown in figure 10-1  are negative  losses accelerate with greater warming  and estimates the identified benefits are listed below.co2  is one of the substances which plants require to grow  increasing its amount in the air contributes to some animals will benefit from the warming the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  has published several major assessments on the effects of global its most recent comprehensive impact assessment was published in publications describing the effects of climate change have also been produced by the following organizations a report by molina et al   no states the overwhelming evidence of human-caused  climate change documents both current impacts with significant costs and extraordinary future risks to society and natural systemsnasa has released public data and tools to predict how temperature and rainfall patterns worldwide may change through to the year 2100  caused by increasing carbon dioxide in earth’s atmosphere  the dataset shows projected changes worldwide on a regional level simulated by 21  climate models  the data can be viewed on a daily timescale for individual cities and towns and may be used to conduct climate risk assessments to predict the local and global effects of weather dangers  for example droughts  floods  heat waves and declines in agriculture productivity  and help plan responses to global warming the and that are referred to in this article use specific and quantitative language to describe uncertainty  this language is intended to provide an indication of the level of confidence that ipcc authors have about a particular finding  the qualitative language used to describe uncertainty has a quantitative scale associated with it  the quantitative values for qualitative terms are intended to ensure that confidence levels are interpreted correctly  the is because qualitative statements  e g   using the word  likely   can be interpreted differently in quantitative levels used in the statements made in ar4  are listed uses the following terms   very low    low    medium    high   and  very high confidence   unlike the tar and ar4,  the scale is qualitative rather than quantitative the quantitative values used by ipcc authors are  subjective  also known as  personalist  or  bayesian  and reflect the expert judgement of ipcc authors  in this formulation  probability is not only a function of an event  but also the state of information that is available to the person making the in this framework  assigned probabilities may change as more or different information becomes ipcc also uses another scale to describe the likelihood of a particular event this is different from the confidence scales described above  and it is possible to assign confidence values to statements of likelihood  for example  the judgement that an event is improbable  e g   rolling a dice twice and getting a six both times  may be assigned a high level of scientific also  the probability that an event has an even chance of occurring  e g   a tossed coin coming up heads  may also be assigned a high level of
