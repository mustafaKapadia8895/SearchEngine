 a pacific hurricane is a mature tropical cyclone that develops within the eastern and central pacific ocean to the east of 180°w,  north of the equator  for tropical cyclone warning purposes  the northern pacific is divided into three regions  the eastern  north america to 140°w),  central (140°w  to 180°),  and western (180°  to 100°e),  while the southern pacific is divided into 2  sections  the australian region (90e  to 160°e)  and the southern pacific basin between 160°e  and identical phenomena in the western north pacific are called typhoons  this separation between the two basins has a practical convenience  however  as tropical cyclones rarely form in the central north pacific due to high vertical wind shear  and few cross the dateline documentation of pacific hurricanes dates to the spanish colonization of mexico  when the military and missions wrote about  tempestades   in 1730,  such accounts indicated an understanding of the storms  after observing the rotating nature of tropical cyclones  meteorologist william charles redfield expanded his study to include storms in the eastern north pacific ocean in the middle of the 19th  century  between june and october 1850,  redfield observed five tropical cyclones along  the southwestern coast of north america   along with one in each of the three subsequent years  in 1895,  cleveland abbe reported the presence of many storms between 5°  to 15°–n  in the eastern pacific  although many such storms dissipated before affecting the mexican coast  two years later  the german hydrography office deutsche seewarte documented 45  storms from 1832  to 1892  off the west coast of the documentation of storms in the region  the official position of the united states weather bureau denied the existence of such storms  in 1910,  the agency reported on global tropical cyclones  noting that  the occurrence of tropical storms is confined to the summer and autumn months of the respective hemispheres and to the western parts of the several oceans   in 1913,  the weather bureau reinforced their position by excluding pacific storms among five tropical cyclone basins  however  the agency acknowledged the existence of  certain cyclones that have been traced for a relatively short distance along a northwest course    west of central california became a state and the discovery of gold there in 1848,  shipping traffic began increasing steadily in the eastern pacific  such activity increased further after the panama canal opened in 1914,  and the shipping lanes moved closer to the coast  by around 1920,  pacific hurricanes were officially recognized due to widespread ship observations  radio service  and a newly created weather network in western mexico  within 60  years  further studies of the region s tropical activity indicated that the eastern pacific was the second most active basin in the the 1920s,  a few documents in the monthly weather review reported additional storms within 2,000  mi (3,200  km  off the mexican eastern pacific hurricane best track database was initially compiled on magnetic tape in 1976  for the seasons between 1949  and 1975,  at the nhc to help with the development of two tropical cyclone forecast models  which required tracks of past cyclones as a base for its the database was based on records held by the united states navy and were interpolated from 12  hourly intervals to 6  hourly intervals based on a scheme devised by hiroshi akima in initially tracks for the central pacific region and tracks for tropical depressions that did not develop into tropical storms or hurricanes were not included within the after the database had been created arthur pike of the nhc made some internal adjustments  while in 1980  a review was made by arnold court under contract from the united states national weather service and resulted in additions and or modifications to 81  tracks in the between 1976–1987,  the nhc archived best track data from the eastern pacific hurricane center  ephc   and in 1982  started including information on central pacific tropical storms and hurricanes started to be included in the database based on data from the joint typhoon warning center and research done by samuel shaw of the central pacific hurricane center  cphc  in format of the database was completely revised by the nhc during 1984,  so that the format could resemble the atlantic database before they took over the warning responsibility from the ephc for the eastern pacific during during 2008  and 2013  several revisions were made to the database to extend tracks in land  based on reports in the mariners weather log and extrapolation of the tracks since the ephc stopped issuing advisories on systems before they made the archives format was significantly changed during 2013  to include non-synoptic  best track times  non-developing  tropical depressions and wind during february 2016,  the nhc released the 1959  mexico hurricane s reanalysis  which was the first system to be reassessed  using methods developed for the atlantic reanalysis presence of a semi-permanent  high-pressure  area known as the north pacific high in the eastern pacific is a dominant factor against formation of tropical cyclones in the winter  as the pacific high results in wind shear that causes environmental conditions for tropical cyclone formation to be not conducive  its effects in the central pacific basin are usually related to keeping cyclones away from the hawaiian islands  due to westward trade winds  hurricanes in the pacific rarely head eastward  unless recurved by a trough  a second factor preventing tropical cyclones from forming during the winter is the occupation of a semi-permanent  low-pressure  area designated the aleutian low between january and april  its presence over western canada and the northwestern united states contributes to the area s occurrences of precipitation in that duration  in addition  its effects in the central pacific near 160°  w causes tropical waves that form in the area to drift northward into the gulf of alaska and dissipate  the retreat of this low allows the pacific high to also retreat into the central pacific  leaving a warm and moist environment in its wake  the intertropical convergence zone comes northward into the east pacific in mid-may  permitting the formation of the earliest tropical coinciding with the start of the eastern pacific hurricane season on may season runs between may 15  and november 30  each these dates encompass the vast majority of tropical cyclone activity in this region the regional specialized meteorological center for this basin is the united states  national hurricane center  previous forecasters are the eastern pacific hurricane center and the joint hurricane warning center  the rsmc monitors the eastern pacific and issues reports  watches and warnings about tropical weather systems and cyclones as defined by the world meteorological organization this area is  on average  the second-most  active basin in the world  there are an average of 16  tropical storms annually  with 9  becoming hurricanes  and 4  becoming major tropical cyclones in this region frequently affect mainland mexico and the revillagigedo islands  less often  a system will affect the continental united states or central america  northbound hurricanes typically reduce to tropical storms or dissipate before reaching the united states  there is only one recorded case of a pacific system reaching california as a hurricane in almost 200  years of observations—the 1858  san diego east pacific hurricanes originate from a tropical wave that drifts westward across the intertropical convergence zone  and across northern parts of south america  once it reaches the pacific  a surface low begins to develop  however  with only little or no convection  after reaching the pacific  it starts to move north-westward  and eventually west  by that time  it develops convection and thunderstorm activity from the warm ocean temperatures but remains disorganized  once the tropical wave becomes organized  it becomes a tropical depression  formation usually occurs from south of the gulf of tehuantepec to south of baja california with a more westerly location earlier in the season  in the eastern pacific  development is more centered than anywhere else  if wind shear is low  a tropical cyclone can undergo rapid intensification as a result of very warm oceans  becoming a major hurricane  tropical cyclones weaken once they reach unfavorable areas for a tropical cyclone formation  their remnants sometimes reach hawaii and cause showers needed there are a few types of pacific hurricane tracks  one is a westerly track  another moves north-westward  along baja california and another moves north  sometimes storms can move north-east  either across central america or mainland mexico and possibly enter the caribbean sea becoming a north atlantic basin tropical cyclone  but these are needed hurricane season runs from june 1  to november 30,  with a strong peak in august and september  however  tropical cyclones have formed outside those should a tropical cyclone enter the central north pacific from the western north pacific  where they occur year-round,  or from the eastern north pacific  where the season starts in may  it is not known if such a system will be considered out of season or not the central pacific hurricane center is the rsmc for this basin and monitors the storms that develop or move into the defined area of responsibility  a previous forecaster was the joint hurricane warning center central pacific hurricanes are rare and on average 3  or 4  storms form or move in this area per year  most often  storms that occur in the area are weak and often decline in strength upon entry  the only land masses impacted by tropical cyclones in this region are hawaii and johnston atoll  due to the small size of the islands in relation to the pacific ocean  direct hits and landfalls are rare hurricanes in the eastern pacific tend to move westward out to sea  harming no land  however  hurricanes can recurve to the north or northeast  hitting central america or mexico early and late in the hurricane season
