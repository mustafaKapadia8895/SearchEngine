 table salt or common salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride  nacl   a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts  salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite  salt is present in vast quantities in seawater  where it is the main mineral constituent  the open ocean has about 35  grams (1.2  oz  of solids per litre  a salinity of 3.5%.salt  is essential for life in general  and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes  animals tissue contain larger quantities of salt than plant tissues do  salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings  and salting is an important method of food preservation some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 8,000  years ago  when people living in the area of present-day  romania boiled spring water to extract salts  a salt-works  in china dates to approximately the same period  salt was also prized by the ancient hebrews  the greeks  the romans  the byzantines  the hittites  egyptians  and the indians  salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the mediterranean sea  along specially built salt roads  and across the sahara on camel caravans  the scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues  salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural significance salt is processed from salt mines  and by the evaporation of seawater  sea salt  and mineral-rich  spring water in shallow pools  its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine  salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride  plastics  paper pulp and many other products  of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt  only about 6%  is used for human consumption  other uses include water conditioning processes  de-icing  highways  and agricultural use  edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking  agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency  as well as its use in cooking and at the table  salt is present in many processed foods sodium is an essential nutrient for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic excessive salt consumption may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases  such as hypertension  in children and adults  such health effects of salt have long been studied  accordingly  numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty the world health organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2,000  mg of sodium  equivalent to 5  grams of salt per through history  the availability of salt has been pivotal to civilization  the word  salary  comes from the latin word for salt because the roman legions were sometimes paid in the natron valley was a key region that supported the egyptian empire to its north  because it supplied it with a kind of salt that came to be called by its name  natron even before this  what is now thought to have been the first city in europe is solnitsata  in bulgaria  which was a salt mine  providing the area now known as the balkans with salt since 5400  even the name solnisata means  salt works  while people have used canning and artificial refrigeration to preserve food for the last hundred years or so  salt has been the best-known  food preservative  especially for meat  for many thousands of a very ancient salt-works  operation has been discovered at the poiana slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in lunca  neamț county  romania  evidence indicates that neolithic people of the precucuteni culture were boiling the salt-laden  spring water through the process of briquetage to extract the salt as far back as 6050  the salt extracted from this operation may have had a direct correlation to the rapid growth of this society s population soon after its initial production the harvest of salt from the surface of xiechi lake near yuncheng in shanxi  china  dates back to at least 6000  bc  making it one of the oldest verifiable is more salt in animal tissues  such as meat  blood  and milk  than in plant nomads who subsist on their flocks and herds do not eat salt with their food  but agriculturalists  feeding mainly on cereals and vegetable matter  need to supplement their diet with with the spread of civilization  salt became one of the world s main trading commodities  it was of high value to the ancient hebrews  the greeks  the romans  the byzantines  the hittites and other peoples of antiquity  in the middle east  salt was used to ceremonially seal an agreement  and the ancient hebrews made a  covenant of salt  with god and sprinkled salt on their offerings to show their trust in an ancient practice in time of war was salting the earth  scattering salt around in a defeated city to prevent plant growth  the bible tells the story of king abimelech who was ordered by god to do this at and various texts claim that the roman general scipio aemilianus africanus ploughed over and sowed the city of carthage with salt after it was defeated in the third punic war (146  may have been used for barter in connection with the obsidian trade in anatolia in the neolithic herodotus described salt trading routes across libya back in the 5th  century bc  in the early years of the roman empire  roads such as the via salaria were built for the transportation of salt from the salt pans of ostia to the salt was included among funeral offerings found in ancient egyptian tombs from the third millennium bc  as were salted birds  and salt from about 2800  bc  the egyptians began exporting salt fish to the phoenicians in return for lebanon cedar  glass  and the dye tyrian purple  the phoenicians traded egyptian salt fish and salt from north africa throughout their mediterranean trade africa  salt was used as currency south of the sahara  and slabs of rock salt were used as coins in moorish merchants in the 6th  century traded salt for gold  weight for weight  the tuareg have traditionally maintained routes across the sahara especially for the transportation of salt by azalai  salt caravans   the caravans still cross the desert from southern niger to bilma  although much of the trade now takes place by truck  each camel takes two bales of fodder and two of trade goods northwards and returns laden with salt pillars and in gabon  before the arrival of europeans  the coast people carried on a remunerative trade with those of the interior by the medium of sea salt  this was gradually displaced by the salt that europeans brought in sacks  so that the coast natives lost their previous profits  as of the author s writing in 1958,  sea salt was still the currency best appreciated in the hallstatt  and hallein lie within 17  km (11  mi  of each other on the river salzach in central austria in an area with extensive salt deposits  salzach literally means  salt river  and salzburg  salt castle   both taking their names from the german word salz meaning salt and hallstatt was the site of the world s first salt the town gave its name to the hallstatt culture that began mining for salt in the area in about 800  bc  around 400  bc  the townsfolk  who had previously used pickaxes and shovels  began open pan salt making  during the first millennium bc  celtic communities grew rich trading salt and salted meat to ancient greece and ancient rome in exchange for wine and other the word salary comes from the latin word for salt  the reason for this is unknown  a persistent modern claim that the roman legions were sometimes paid in salt is the word salad literally means  salted   and comes from the ancient roman practice of salting leaf have been fought over salt  venice fought and won a war with genoa over the product  and it played an important part in the american revolution  cities on overland trade routes grew rich by levying and towns like liverpool flourished on the export of salt extracted from the salt mines of various governments have at different times imposed salt taxes on their peoples  the voyages of christopher columbus are said to have been financed from salt production in southern spain  and the oppressive salt tax in france was one of the causes of the french revolution  after being repealed  this tax was reimposed by napoleon when he became emperor to pay for his foreign wars  and was not finally abolished until in 1930,  mahatma gandhi led at least 100,000  people on the  dandi march  or  salt satyagraha   in which protesters made their own salt from the sea thus defying british rule and avoiding paying the salt tax  this civil disobedience inspired millions of common people and elevated the indian independence movement from an elitist movement to a national is mostly sodium chloride  the ionic compound with the formula nacl  representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine  sea salt and freshly mined salt  much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas  also contain small amounts of trace elements  which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health   mined salt is often refined in the production of table salt  it is dissolved in water  purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution  and re-evaporated.  during this same refining process it is often also iodized  salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape  they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge  the molar mass of salt is 58.443  g mol  its melting point is 801  °c (1,474  °f  and its boiling point 1,465  °c (2,669  °f   its density is 2.17  grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water  when dissolved in water it separates into na  and cl− ions  and the solubility is 359  grams per from cold solutions  salt crystallises as the dihydrate nacl·2h2o.  solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water  the freezing point is −21.12  °c (−6.02  °f  for 23.31  wt  of salt  and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7  °c (227.7  is essential to the health of humans and other animals  and it is one of the five basic taste salt is used in many cuisines around the world  and it is often found in salt shakers on diners  eating tables for their personal use on food  salt is also an ingredient in many manufactured foodstuffs  table salt is a refined salt containing about 97  to 99  percent sodium usually  anticaking agents such as sodium aluminosilicate or magnesium carbonate are added to make it free-flowing.  iodized salt  containing potassium iodide  is widely available  some people put a desiccant  such as a few grains of uncooked or a saltine cracker  in their salt shakers to absorb extra moisture and help break up salt clumps that may otherwise table salt sold for consumption contain additives which address a variety of health concerns  especially in the developing world  the identities and amounts of additives vary widely from country to country  iodine is an important micronutrient for humans  and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine  hypothyroidism  and enlargement of the thyroid gland  endemic goitre  in adults or cretinism in iodized salt has been used to correct these conditions since and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide  sodium iodide or sodium iodate  a small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize the iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of mental iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is amount of iodine and the specific iodine compound added to salt varies from country to country  in the united states  the food and drug administration  fda  recommends cfr 101.9  (c)(8)(iv)]  150  micrograms of iodine per day for both men and women  us iodized salt contains 46–77  ppm  parts per million   whereas in the uk the iodine content of iodized salt is recommended to be 10–22  ferrocyanide  also known as yellow prussiate of soda  is sometimes added to salt as an anticaking agent  the additive is considered safe for human such anti-caking  agents have been added since at least 1911  when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more the safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive was found to be provisionally acceptable by the committee on toxicity in other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate  calcium or magnesium carbonates  fatty acid salts  acid salts   magnesium oxide  silicon dioxide  calcium silicate  sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate  both the european union and the united states food and drug administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two  doubly fortified salt   both iodide and iron salts are added  the latter alleviates iron deficiency anaemia  which interferes with the mental development of an estimated 40%  of infants in the developing world  a typical iron source is ferrous another additive  especially important for pregnant women  is folic acid  vitamin b9),  which gives the table salt a yellow color  folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects and anaemia  which affect young mothers  especially in developing lack of fluorine in the diet is the cause of a greatly increased incidence of dental fluoride salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay  especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water  the practice is more common in some european countries where water fluoridation is not carried out  in france  35%  of the table salt sold contains added sodium sea salt contains small amounts of magnesium and calcium halides and sulfates  traces of algal products  salt-resistant  bacteria and sediment particles  the calcium and magnesium salts confer a faintly bitter overtone  and they make unrefined sea salt hygroscopic  i e   it gradually absorbs moisture from air if stored uncovered   algal products contribute a mildly  fishy  or "sea-air"  odour  the latter from organobromine compounds  sediments  the proportion of which varies with the source  give the salt a dull grey appearance  since taste and aroma compounds are often detectable by humans in minute concentrations  sea salt may have a more complex flavor than pure sodium chloride when sprinkled on top of food  when salt is added during cooking however  these flavors would likely be overwhelmed by those of the food the refined salt industry cites scientific studies saying that raw sea and rock salts do not contain enough iodine salts to prevent iodine deficiency natural salts have different mineralities depending on their source  giving each one a unique flavour  fleur de sel  a natural sea salt from the surface of evaporating brine in salt pans  has a unique flavour varying with the region from which it is produced  in traditional korean cuisine  so-called   bamboo salt  is prepared by roasting in a bamboo container plugged with mud at both ends  this product absorbs minerals from the bamboo and the mud  and has been claimed to increase the anticlastogenic and antimutagenic properties of doenjang  a fermented bean salt  though refined  contains no iodine and has a much larger grain size than most refined salts  this can give it different properties when used in cooking  and can be useful for preparing kosher meat  some kosher salt has been certified to meet kosher requirements by a hechsher  but this is not true for all products labelled as kosher salt is ultrafine to speed dissolving to make brine  gourmet salts may be used for specific tastes salt is present in most foods  but in naturally occurring foodstuffs such as meats  vegetables and fruit  it is present in very small quantities  it is often added to processed foods  such as canned foods and especially salted foods  pickled foods  and snack foods or other convenience foods   where it functions as both a preservative and a flavoring  dairy salt is used in the preparation of butter and cheese before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration  salting was one of the main methods of food preservation  thus  herring contains 67  mg sodium per 100  g  while kipper  its preserved form  contains 990  mg  similarly  pork typically contains 63  mg while bacon contains 1,480  mg  and potatoes contain 7  mg but potato crisps 800  mg per 100  the main sources of salt in the diet  apart from direct use of sodium chloride  are bread and cereal products  meat products and milk and dairy many east asian cultures  salt is not traditionally used as a in its place  condiments such as soy sauce  fish sauce and oyster sauce tend to have a high sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures  they are most often used for cooking rather than as table salt is made up of just under 40%  sodium by weight  so a 6  g serving (1  teaspoon  contains about 2,300  mg of sodium serves a vital purpose in the human body  via its role as an electrolyte  it helps nerves and muscles to function correctly  and it is one factor involved in the osmotic regulation of water content in body organs  fluid most of the sodium in the western diet comes from the habitual salt intake in many western countries is about 10  g per day  and it is higher than that in many countries in eastern europe and the high level of sodium in many processed foods has a major impact on the total amount in the united states  75%  of the sodium eaten comes from processed and restaurant foods  11%  from cooking and table use and the rest from what is found naturally in consuming too much sodium increases risk of cardiovascular health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of high sodium intake is associated with a greater risk of stroke  total cardiovascular disease and kidney a reduction in sodium intake by 1,000  mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30  in adults and children with no acute illness  a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood a low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with world health organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2,000  mg of sodium  which is contained in 5  g of salt  per guidelines by the united states recommend that people with hypertension  african americans  and middle-aged  and older adults should limit consumption to no more than 1,500  mg of sodium per day and meet the potassium recommendation of 4,700  mg day with a healthy diet of fruits and reduction of sodium intake to less than 2,300  mg per day is recommended by developed one review recommended that sodium intake be reduced to at least 1,200  mg  contained in 3  g of salt  per day  as a further reduction in salt intake the greater the fall in systolic blood pressure for all age groups and another review indicated that there is inconsistent insufficient evidence to conclude that reducing sodium intake to lower than 2,300  mg per day is either beneficial or of the two most prominent dietary risks for disability in the world is eating too much about 6%  of the salt manufactured in the world is used in food  of the remainder  12%  is used in water conditioning processes  8%  goes for de-icing  highways and 6%  is used in agriculture  the rest (68%)  is used for manufacturing and other industrial and sodium chloride is one of the largest inorganic raw materials used by volume  its major chemical products are caustic soda and chlorine  which are separated by the electrolysis of a pure brine solution  these are used in the manufacture of pvc  plastics  paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds  salt is also used as a flux in the production of aluminium  for this purpose  a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants  it is also used in the manufacture of soaps and glycerine  where it is added to the vat to precipitate out the saponified products  as an emulsifier  salt is used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber  and another use is in the firing of pottery  when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material  forming a strong drilling through loose materials such as sand or gravel  salt may be added to the drilling fluid to provide a stable  wall  to prevent the hole collapsing  there are many other processes in which salt is involved  these include its use as a mordant in textile dying  to regenerate resins in water softening  for the tanning of hides  the preservation of meat and fish and the canning of meat and grade salt accounts for only a small part of salt production in industrialized countries (7%  in although worldwide  food uses account for 17.5%  of total 2013,  total world production of salt was 264  million tonnes  the top five producers being china (71  million   the united states (40  million   india (18  million   germany (12  million  and canada (11  manufacture of salt is one of the oldest chemical a major source of salt is seawater  which has a salinity of approximately 3.5%.  this means that there are about 35  grams (1.2  oz  of dissolved salts  predominantly sodium  na   and chloride  cl−  ions  per kilogram (2.2  lbs  of the world s oceans are a virtually inexhaustible source of salt  and this abundance of supply means that reserves have not been the evaporation of seawater is the production method of choice in marine countries with high evaporation and low precipitation rates  salt evaporation ponds are filled from the ocean and salt crystals can be harvested as the water dries up  sometimes these ponds have vivid colours  as some species of algae and other micro-organisms  thrive in conditions of high salt is extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes  these are either mined directly  producing rock salt  or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit  in either case  the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine  traditionally  this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation  more recently  the process is performed in pans under the raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics  this usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities  largely magnesium and calcium salts   multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals  which are some salt is produced using the alberger process  which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals  and produces a grainy-type  the ayoreo  an indigenous group from the paraguayan chaco  obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the indian salt tree  maytenus vitis-idaea)  and other of the largest salt mining operations in the world is at the khewra salt mine in pakistan  the mine has nineteen storeys  eleven of which are underground  and 400  km (250  mi  of passages  the salt is dug out by the room and pillar method  where about half the material is left in place to support the upper levels  extraction of himalayan salt is expected to last 350  years at the present rate of extraction of around 385,000  tons per has long held an important place in religion and culture  at the time of brahmanic sacrifices  in hittite rituals and during festivals held by semites and greeks at the time of the new moon  salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling the ancient egyptians  greeks and romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think this to be the origin of holy water in the christian in aztec mythology  huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt is considered to be a very auspicious substance in hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings  and in jainism  devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person s cremated remains before the ashes are salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in mahayana buddhist tradition  and when returning home from a funeral  a pinch of salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the in shinto  salt is used for ritual purification of locations and people  harae  specifically shubatsu   and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the two-fold  purposes of warding off evil and attracting the hebrew bible  there are thirty-five  verses which mention one of these mentions lot s wife  who was turned into a pillar of salt when she looked back at the cities of sodom and gomorrah  genesis 19:26)  as they were destroyed  when the judge abimelech destroyed the city of shechem  he is said to have  sown salt on it   probably as a curse on anyone who would re-inhabit  it  judges 9:45).  the book of job contains the first mention of salt as a condiment   can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt  or is there any taste in the white of an egg    job in the new testament  six verses mention salt  in the sermon on the mount  jesus referred to his followers as the  salt of the earth   the apostle paul also encouraged christians to  let your conversation be always full of grace  seasoned with salt   colossians salt is mandatory in the rite of the tridentine salt is used in the third item  which includes an exorcism  of the celtic consecration  cf  gallican rite  that is employed in the consecration of a church  salt may be added to the water  where it is customary  in the roman catholic rite of holy judaism  it is recommended to have either a salty bread or to add salt to the bread if this bread is unsalted when doing kiddush for shabbat  it is customary to spread some salt over the bread or to dip the bread in a little salt when passing the bread around the table after the to preserve the covenant between their people and god  jews dip the sabbath bread in wicca  salt is symbolic of the element earth  it is also believed to cleanse an area of harmful or negative energies  a dish of salt and a dish of water are almost always present on an altar  and salt is used in a wide variety of rituals and
