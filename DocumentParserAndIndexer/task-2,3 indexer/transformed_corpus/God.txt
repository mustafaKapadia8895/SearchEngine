 in monotheistic thought  god is conceived of as the supreme being and the principal object of the concept of god  as described by theologians  commonly includes the attributes of omniscience (all-knowing),  omnipotence  unlimited power   omnipresence  present everywhere   divine simplicity  and as having an eternal and necessary existence  many theologians also describe god as being omnibenevolent  perfectly good  and all needed god is most often held to be incorporeal and to be without although many religions describe god using masculine terminology  using such terms as  him  or  father  and some religions  such as judaism  attribute only a purely grammatical  gender  to incorporeity and corporeity of god are related to conceptions of transcendence  being outside nature  and immanence  being in nature  in the world  of god  with positions of synthesis such as the  immanent transcendence  of chinese theology god has been conceived as either personal or impersonal  in theism  god is the creator and sustainer of the universe  while in deism  god is the creator  but not the sustainer  of the universe  in pantheism  god is the universe itself  in atheism  god is not believed to exist  while god is deemed unknown or unknowable within the context of agnosticism  god has also been conceived as the source of all moral obligation  and the  greatest conceivable many notable philosophers have developed arguments for and against the existence of many different conceptions of god  and competing claims as to god s characteristics  aims  and actions  have led to the development of ideas of omnitheism  or a perennial philosophy  which postulates that there is one underlying theological truth  of which all religions express a partial understanding  and as to which  the devout in the various great world religions are in fact worshipping that one god  but through different  overlapping concepts or mental images of are many names for god  and different names are attached to different cultural ideas about god s identity and attributes  in the ancient egyptian era of atenism  possibly the earliest recorded monotheistic religion  this deity was called premised on being the one  true  supreme being and creator of the in the hebrew bible and judaism   he who is    i am that i am   and the tetragrammaton yhwh  hebrew  יהוה‎‎  which means   i am who i am    he who exists   are used as names of god  while yahweh and jehovah are sometimes used in christianity as vocalizations of yhwh  in the christian doctrine of the trinity  god  consubstantial in three persons  is called the father  the son  and the holy spirit  in judaism  it is common to refer to god by the titular names elohim or adonai  the latter of which is believed by some scholars to descend from the egyptian in islam  the name allah is used  while muslims also have a multitude of titular names for god  in hinduism  brahman is often considered a monistic concept of in chinese religion  god is conceived as the progenitor  first ancestor  of the universe  intrinsic to it and constantly ordaining it  other religions have names for god  for instance  baha in the bahá í waheguru in and ahura mazda in earliest written form of the germanic word god  always  in this usage  comes from the 6th-century  christian codex argenteus  the english word itself is derived from the proto-germanic    ǥuđan  the reconstructed proto-indo-european  form   ǵhu-tó-m  was likely based on the root   ǵhau(ə)-,  which meant either  to call  or  to the germanic words for god were originally neuter—applying to both genders—but during the process of the christianization of the germanic peoples from their indigenous germanic paganism  the words became a masculine syntactic the english language  capitalization is used for names by which a god is known  including  god   consequently  the capitalized form of god is not used for multiple gods  polytheism  or when used to refer to the generic idea of a the english word god and its counterparts in other languages are normally used for any and all conceptions and  in spite of significant differences between religions  the term remains an english translation common to all  the same holds for hebrew el  but in judaism  god is also given a proper name  the tetragrammaton yhwh  in origin possibly the name of an edomite or midianite deity  yahweh  in many translations of the bible  when the word lord is in all capitals  it signifies that the word represents the  arabic  الله‎‎  is the arabic term with no plural used by muslims and arabic speaking christians and jews meaning  the god   with a capital g   while  ʾilāh   arabic  إله‎‎  is the term used for a deity or a god in god may also be given a proper name in monotheistic currents of hinduism which emphasize the personal nature of god  with early references to his name as krishna-vasudeva  in bhagavata or later vishnu and mazda is the name for god used in zoroastrianism   mazda   or rather the avestan stem-form  mazdā-,  nominative mazdå  reflects proto-iranian   mazdāh  female   it is generally taken to be the proper name of the spirit  and like its sanskrit cognate medhā  means  intelligence  or  wisdom   both the avestan and sanskrit words reflect proto-indo-iranian  *mazdhā-,  from proto-indo-european  mn̩sdʰeh1,  literally meaning  placing (dʰeh1)  one s mind (*mn̩-s)",  hence  punjabi  vāhigurū  is a term most often used in sikhism to refer to god  it means  wonderful teacher  in the punjabi language  vāhi  a middle persian borrowing  means  wonderful  and guru  sanskrit  guru  is a term denoting  teacher   waheguru is also described by some as an experience of ecstasy which is beyond all descriptions  the most common usage of the word  waheguru  is in the greeting sikhs use with each other waheguru ji ka khalsa  waheguru ji ki fateh wonderful lord s khalsa  victory is to the wonderful lord baha  the  greatest  name for god in the baha i faith  is arabic for "all-glorious".there  is no clear consensus on the nature or even the existence of the abrahamic conceptions of god include the monotheistic definition of god in judaism  the trinitarian view of christians  and the islamic concept of god  the dharmic religions differ in their view of the divine  views of god in hinduism vary by region  sect  and caste  ranging from monotheistic to polytheistic  many polytheistic religions share the idea of a creator deity  though having a name other than  god  and without all of the other roles attributed to a singular god by monotheistic religions  jainism is and non-creationist.  depending on one s interpretation and tradition  buddhism can be conceived as being either atheistic  non-theistic,  pantheistic  panentheistic  or polytheistic monotheists hold that there is only one god  and may claim that the one true god is worshiped in different religions under different names  the view that all theists actually worship the same god  whether they know it or not  is especially emphasized in and in christianity  the doctrine of the trinity describes god as one god in three persons  the trinity comprises the father  the son  embodied metaphysically by jesus   and the holy islam s most fundamental concept is tawhid  meaning  oneness  or  uniqueness    god is described in the quran as   say  he is allah  the one and only  allah  the eternal  absolute  he begetteth not  nor is he begotten  and there is none like unto muslims repudiate the christian doctrine of the trinity and the divinity of jesus  comparing it to polytheism  in islam  god is beyond all comprehension or equal and does not resemble any of his creations in any way  thus  muslims are not iconodules  and are not expected to visualize is the belief and worship of a single god while accepting the existence or possible existence of other generally holds that god exists realistically  objectively  and independently of human thought  that god created and sustains everything  that god is omnipotent and eternal  and that god is personal and interacting with the universe through  for example  religious experience and the prayers of theism holds that god is both transcendent and immanent  thus  god is simultaneously infinite and  in some way  present in the affairs of the not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions  but each usually subscribes to some of them  see  by way of comparison  family catholic theology holds that god is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time  most theists hold that god is omnipotent  omniscient  and benevolent  although this belief raises questions about god s responsibility for evil and suffering in the world  some theists ascribe to god a self-conscious  or purposeful limiting of omnipotence  omniscience  or benevolence  open theism  by contrast  contends that  due to the nature of time  god s omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future  theism is sometimes used to refer in general to any belief in a god or gods  i e   monotheism or holds that god is wholly transcendent  god exists  but does not intervene in the world beyond what was necessary to create in this view  god is not anthropomorphic  and neither answers prayers nor produces miracles  common in deism is a belief that god has no interest in humanity and may not even be aware of humanity  pandeism combines deism with pantheistic pandeism is proposed to explain as to deism why god would create a universe and then abandon and as to pantheism  the origin and purpose of the holds that god is the universe and the universe is god  whereas panentheism holds that god contains  but is not identical to  the it is also the view of the liberal catholic church  theosophy  some views of hinduism except vaishnavism  which believes in panentheism  sikhism  some divisions of neopaganism and taoism  along with many varying denominations and individuals within denominations  kabbalah  jewish mysticism  paints a pantheistic panentheistic view of god—which has wide acceptance in hasidic judaism  particularly from their founder the baal shem tov—but only as an addition to the jewish view of a personal god  not in the original pantheistic sense that denies or limits persona to needed dystheism  which is related to theodicy  is a form of theism which holds that god is either not wholly good or is fully malevolent as a consequence of the problem of evil  one such example comes from dostoevsky s the brothers karamazov  in which ivan karamazov rejects god on the grounds that he allows children to modern times  some more abstract concepts have been developed  such as process theology and open theism  the contemporaneous french philosopher michel henry has however proposed a phenomenological approach and definition of god as phenomenological essence of has also been conceived as being incorporeal  immaterial   a personal being  the source of all moral obligation  and the  greatest conceivable these attributes were all supported to varying degrees by the early jewish  christian and muslim theologian philosophers  including augustine of and respectively.non-theist  views about god also vary  some non-theists  avoid the concept of god  whilst accepting that it is significant to many  other non-theists  understand god as a symbol of human values and aspirations  the nineteenth-century  english atheist charles bradlaugh declared that he refused to say  there is no god   because  the word  god  is to me a sound conveying no clear or distinct he said more specifically that he disbelieved in the christian god  stephen jay gould proposed an approach dividing the world of philosophy into what he called "non-overlapping  magisteria   noma   in this view  questions of the supernatural  such as those relating to the existence and nature of god  are non-empirical  and are the proper domain of theology  the methods of science should then be used to answer any empirical question about the natural world  and theology should be used to answer questions about ultimate meaning and moral value  in this view  the perceived lack of any empirical footprint from the magisterium of the supernatural onto natural events makes science the sole player in the natural view  advanced by richard dawkins  is that the existence of god is an empirical question  on the grounds that  a universe with a god would be a completely different kind of universe from one without  and it would be a scientific carl sagan argued that the doctrine of a creator of the universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could disprove the existence of a creator  not necessarily a god  would be the discovery that the universe is infinitely hawking and co-author  leonard mlodinow state in their book  the grand design  that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe  but if the answer is god  then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created god  both authors claim however  that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science  and without invoking any divine is the view that  the truth values of certain claims – especially metaphysical and religious claims such as whether god  the divine or the supernatural exist – are unknown and perhaps is  in a broad sense  the rejection of belief in the existence of deities  or a in a narrower sense  atheism is specifically the position that there are no boyer argues that while there is a wide array of supernatural concepts found around the world  in general  supernatural beings tend to behave much like people  the construction of gods and spirits like persons is one of the best known traits of religion  he cites examples from greek mythology  which is  in his opinion  more like a modern soap opera than other religious bertrand du castel and timothy jurgensen demonstrate through formalization that boyer s explanatory model matches physics  epistemology in positing not directly observable entities as anthropologist stewart guthrie contends that people project human features onto non-human  aspects of the world because it makes those aspects more familiar  sigmund freud also suggested that god concepts are projections of one s émile durkheim was one of the earliest to suggest that gods represent an extension of human social life to include supernatural beings  in line with this reasoning  psychologist matt rossano contends that when humans began living in larger groups  they may have created gods as a means of enforcing morality  in small groups  morality can be enforced by social forces such as gossip or reputation  however  it is much harder to enforce morality using social forces in much larger groups  rossano indicates that by including ever-watchful  gods and spirits  humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative about the existence of god typically include empirical  deductive  and inductive types  different views include that   god does not exist   strong atheism    god almost certainly does not exist   de facto atheism    no one knows whether god exists  exists  but this cannot be proven or disproven   de facto theism   and that  god exists and this can be proven   strong arguments have been proposed to prove the existence of some of the most notable arguments are the five ways of aquinas  the argument from desire proposed by c s  lewis  and the ontological argument formulated both by st  anselm and rené anselm s approach was to define god as   that than which nothing greater can be conceived   famed pantheist philosopher baruch spinoza would later carry this idea to its extreme   by god i understand a being absolutely infinite  i e   a substance consisting of infinite attributes  of which each one expresses an eternal and infinite essence   for spinoza  the whole of the natural universe is made of one substance  god  or its equivalent  his proof for the existence of god was a variation of the ontological isaac newton saw god as the masterful creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all nevertheless  he rejected polymath leibniz  thesis that god would necessarily make a perfect world which requires no intervention from the creator  in query 31  of the opticks  newton simultaneously made an argument from design and for the necessity of intervention for while comets move in very eccentric orbs in all manner of positions  blind fate could never make all the planets move one and the same way in orbs concentric  some inconsiderable irregularities excepted which may have arisen from the mutual actions of comets and planets on one another  and which will be apt to increase  till this system wants a thomas believed that the existence of god is self-evident  in itself  but not to us   therefore i say that this proposition   god exists   of itself is self-evident,  for the predicate is the same as the subject     now because we do not know the essence of god  the proposition is not self-evident  to us  but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us  though less known in their nature—namely  by st  thomas believed that the existence of god can be demonstrated  briefly in the summa theologiae and more extensively in the summa contra gentiles  he considered in great detail five arguments for the existence of god  widely known as the quinque viae  five ways  some theologians  such as the scientist and theologian a e  mcgrath  argue that the existence of god is not a question that can be answered using the scientific agnostic stephen jay gould argues that science and religion are not in conflict and do not findings in the fields of cosmology  evolutionary biology and neuroscience are interpreted by some atheists  including lawrence m  krauss and sam harris  as evidence that god is an imaginary entity only  with no basis in these atheists claim that a single  omniscient god who is imagined to have created the universe and is particularly attentive to the lives of humans has been imagined  embellished and promulgated in a trans-generational  richard dawkins interprets such findings not only as a lack of evidence for the material existence of such a god  but as extensive evidence to the however  his views are opposed by some theologians and scientists including alister mcgrath  who argues that existence of god is compatible with religious traditions assign differing  though often similar  attributes and characteristics to god  including expansive powers and abilities  psychological characteristics  gender characteristics  and preferred nomenclature  the assignment of these attributes often differs according to the conceptions of god in the culture from which they arise  for example  attributes of god in christianity  attributes of god in islam  and the thirteen attributes of mercy in judaism share certain similarities arising from their common roots the word god is  one of the most complex and difficult in the english language   in the judeo-christian  tradition   the bible has been the principal source of the conceptions of god   that the bible  includes many different images  concepts  and ways of thinking about  god has resulted in perpetual  disagreements about how god is to be conceived and the hebrew and christian bibles there are many names for god  one of them is elohim  another one is el shaddai  translated  god a third notable name is el elyon  which means  the high is described and referred in the quran and hadith by certain names or attributes  the most common being al-rahman,  meaning  most compassionate  and al-rahim,  meaning  most merciful   see names of god in brahma kumaris use the term  supreme soul  to refer to god  they see god as incorporeal and eternal  and regard him as a point of living light like human souls  but without a physical body  as he does not enter the cycle of birth  death and rebirth  god is seen as the perfect and constant embodiment of all virtues  powers and values and that he is the unconditionally loving father of all souls  irrespective of their religion  gender  or a tradition in hinduism  has list of titles and names of krishna the gender of god may be viewed as either a literal or an allegorical aspect of a deity who  in classical western philosophy  transcends bodily polytheistic religions commonly attribute to each of the gods a gender  allowing each to interact with any of the others  and perhaps with humans  sexually  in most monotheistic religions  god has no counterpart with which to relate sexually  thus  in classical western philosophy the gender of this one-and-only  deity is most likely to be an analogical statement of how humans and god address  and relate to  each other  namely  god is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active  as opposed to the receptive  role in sexual sources usually refer to god using male words  except genesis psalm 123:2–3,  and luke 15:8–10   female   hosea 11:3–4,  deuteronomy 32:18,  isaiah 66:13,  isaiah 49:15,  isaiah 42:14,  psalm 131:2   a mother   deuteronomy 32:11–12   a mother eagle   and matthew 23:37  and luke 13:34   a mother hen  prayer plays a significant role among many believers  muslims believe that the purpose of existence is to worship he is viewed as a personal god and there are no intermediaries  such as clergy  to contact god  prayer often also includes supplication and asking forgiveness  god is often believed to be forgiving  for example  a hadith states god would replace a sinless people with one who sinned but still asked christian theologian alister mcgrath writes that there are good reasons to suggest that a  personal god  is integral to the christian outlook  but that one has to understand it is an analogy   to say that god is like a person is to affirm the divine ability and willingness to relate to others  this does not imply that god is human  or located at a specific point in the of different religions generally disagree as to how to best worship god and what is god s plan for mankind  if there is one  there are different approaches to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic religions  one view is taken by exclusivists  who believe they are the chosen people or have exclusive access to absolute truth  generally through revelation or encounter with the divine  which adherents of other religions do not  another view is religious pluralism  a pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one  but does not deny the partial truth of other religions  an example of a pluralist view in christianity is supersessionism  i e   the belief that one s religion is the fulfillment of previous religions  a third approach is relativistic inclusivism  where everybody is seen as equally right  an example being universalism  the doctrine that salvation is eventually available for everyone  a fourth approach is syncretism  mixing different elements from different religions  an example of syncretism is the new age movement jews and christians believe that humans are created in the likeness of god  and are the center  crown and key to god s creation  stewards for god  supreme over everything else god had made  gen 1:26);  for this reason  humans are in christianity called the  children of is defined as and invisible from direct sight  and thus cannot be portrayed in a literal visual image the respective principles of religions may or may not permit them to use images  which are entirely symbolic  to represent god in art or in worship  during the early parthian empire  ahura mazda was visually represented for worship  this practice ended during the beginning of the sassanid empire  zoroastrian iconoclasm  which can be traced to the end of the parthian period and the beginning of the sassanid  eventually put an end to the use of all images of ahura mazda in worship  however  ahura mazda continued to be symbolized by a dignified male figure  standing or on horseback which is found in sassanian believe that god  allah  is beyond all comprehension or equal and does not resemble any of his creations in any way  thus  muslims are not iconodules  are not expected to visualize least some jews do not use any image for god  since god is the unimaginable being who cannot be represented in material in some samples of jewish art  however  sometimes god  or at least his intervention  is indicated by a hand of god symbol  which represents the bath kol  literally  daughter of a voice   or voice of christians believed that the words of the gospel of john 1:18:   no man has seen god at any time  and numerous other statements were meant to apply not only to god  but to all attempts at the depiction of later depictions are found  some  like the hand of god  are depiction borrowed from jewish art the beginning of the 8th  century witnessed the suppression and destruction of religious icons as the period of byzantine iconoclasm  literally image-breaking)  started  the second council of nicaea in 787  effectively ended the first period of byzantine iconoclasm and restored the honouring of icons and holy images in however  this did not immediately translate into large scale depictions of god the father  even supporters of the use of icons in the 8th  century  such as saint john of damascus  drew a distinction between images of god the father and those of christ prior to the 10th  century no attempt was made to use a human to symbolize god the father in western yet  western art eventually required some way to illustrate the presence of the father  so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for symbolizing the father using a man gradually emerged around the 10th  century ad  a rationale for the use of a human is the belief that god created the soul of man in the image of his own  thus allowing human to transcend the other animals  it appears that when early artists designed to represent god the father  fear and awe restrained them from a usage of the whole human figure  typically only a small part would be used as the image  usually the hand  or sometimes the face  but rarely a whole human  in many images  the figure of the son supplants the father  so a smaller portion of the person of the father is the 12th  century depictions of god the father had started to appear in french illuminated manuscripts  which as a less public form could often be more adventurous in their iconography  and in stained glass church windows in england  initially the head or bust was usually shown in some form of frame of clouds in the top of the picture space  where the hand of god had formerly appeared  the baptism of christ on the famous baptismal font in liège of rainer of huy is an example from 1118   a hand of god is used in another scene   gradually the amount of the human symbol shown can increase to a half-length  figure  then a full-length,  usually enthroned  as in giotto s fresco of c  1305  in in the 14th  century the naples bible carried a depiction of god the father in the burning bush  by the early 15th  century  the très riches heures du duc de berry has a considerable number of symbols  including an elderly but tall and elegant full-length  figure walking in the garden of eden  which show a considerable diversity of apparent ages and dress  the  gates of paradise  of the florence baptistry by lorenzo ghiberti  begun in 1425  use a similar tall full-length  symbol for the father  the rohan book of hours of about 1430  also included depictions of god the father in half-length  human form  which were now becoming standard  and the hand of god becoming rarer  at the same period other works  like the large genesis altarpiece by the hamburg painter meister bertram  continued to use the old depiction of christ as logos in genesis scenes  in the 15th  century there was a brief fashion for depicting all three persons of the trinity as similar or identical figures with the usual appearance of christ in an early venetian school coronation of the virgin by giovanni d alemagna and antonio vivarini   c  1443)  the father is depicted using the symbol consistently used by other artists later  namely a patriarch  with benign  yet powerful countenance and with long white hair and a beard  a depiction largely derived from  and justified by  the near-physical,  but still figurative  description of the ancient of    the ancient of days did sit  whose garment was white as snow  and the hair of his head like the pure wool  his throne was like the fiery flame  and his wheels as burning fire   daniel 7:9)in  the annunciation by benvenuto di giovanni in 1470,  god the father is portrayed in the red robe and a hat that resembles that of a cardinal  however  even in the later part of the 15th  century  the symbolic representation of the father and the holy spirit as  hands and dove  continued  e g  in verrocchio s baptism of christ in renaissance paintings of the adoration of the trinity  god may be depicted in two ways  either with emphasis on the father  or the three elements of the trinity  the most usual depiction of the trinity in renaissance art depicts god the father using an old man  usually with a long beard and patriarchal in appearance  sometimes with a triangular halo  as a reference to the trinity   or with a papal crown  specially in northern renaissance painting  in these depictions the father may hold a globe or book  to symbolize god s knowledge and as a reference to how knowledge is deemed divine   he is behind and above christ on the cross in the throne of mercy iconography  a dove  the symbol of the holy spirit may hover above  various people from different classes of society  e g  kings  popes or martyrs may be present in the picture  in a trinitarian pietà  god the father is often symbolized using a man wearing a papal dress and a papal crown  supporting the dead christ in his arms  they are depicted as floating in heaven with angels who carry the instruments of the of god the father and the trinity were attacked both by protestants and within catholicism  by the jansenist and baianist movements as well as more orthodox theologians  as with other attacks on catholic imagery  this had the effect both of reducing church support for the less central depictions  and strengthening it for the core ones  in the western church  the pressure to restrain religious imagery resulted in the highly influential decrees of the final session of the council of trent in 1563.  the council of trent decrees confirmed the traditional catholic doctrine that images only represented the person depicted  and that veneration to them was paid to the person  not the depictions of god the father were uncontroversial in catholic art thereafter  but less common depictions of the trinity were condemned  in 1745  pope benedict xiv explicitly supported the throne of mercy depiction  referring to the  ancient of days   but in 1786  it was still necessary for pope pius vi to issue a papal bull condemning the decision of an italian church council to remove all images of the trinity from the father is symbolized in several genesis scenes in michelangelo s sistine chapel ceiling  most famously the creation of adam  whose image of near touching hands of god and adam is iconic of humanity  being a reminder that man is created in the image and likeness of god  gen 1:26)).god  the father is depicted as a powerful figure  floating in the clouds in titian s assumption of the virgin in the frari of venice  long admired as a masterpiece of high renaissance the church of the gesù in rome includes a number of 16th  century depictions of god the father  in some of these paintings the trinity is still alluded to in terms of three angels  but giovanni battista fiammeri also depicted god the father as a man riding on a cloud  above the both the last judgment and the coronation of the virgin paintings by rubens he depicted god the father using the image that by then had become widely accepted  a bearded patriarchal figure above the fray  in the 17th  century  the two spanish artists velázquez  whose father-in-law  francisco pacheco was in charge of the approval of new images for the inquisition  and murillo both depicted god the father using a patriarchal figure with a white beard in a purple robe while representations of god the father were growing in italy  spain  germany and the low countries  there was resistance elsewhere in europe  even during the 17th  century  in 1632  most members of the star chamber court in england  except the archbishop of york  condemned the use of the images of the trinity in church windows  and some considered them later in the 17th  century sir thomas browne wrote that he considered the representation of god the father using an old man  a dangerous act  that might lead to egyptian in 1847,  charles winston was still critical of such images as a  romish trend   a term used to refer to roman catholics  that he considered best avoided in 1667  the 43rd  chapter of the great moscow council specifically included a ban on a number of symbolic depictions of god the father and the holy spirit  which then also resulted in a whole range of other icons being placed on the forbidden mostly affecting western-style  depictions which had been gaining ground in orthodox icons  the council also declared that the person of the trinity who was the  ancient of days  was christ  as logos  not god the father  however some icons continued to be produced in russia  as well as greece  romania  and other orthodox countries theologians and philosophers have attributed to god such characteristics as omniscience  omnipotence  omnipresence  perfect goodness  divine simplicity  and eternal and necessary existence  god has been described as incorporeal  a personal being  the source of all moral obligation  and the greatest conceivable being these attributes were all claimed to varying degrees by the early jewish  christian and muslim scholars  including st and philosophers developed arguments for the existence of while attempting to comprehend the precise implications of god s attributes  reconciling some of those attributes generated important philosophical problems and debates  for example  god s omniscience may seem to imply that god knows how free agents will choose to act  if god does know this  their ostensible free will might be illusory  or foreknowledge does not imply predestination  and if god does not know it  god may not be last centuries of philosophy have seen vigorous questions regarding the arguments for god s existence raised by such philosophers as immanuel kant  david hume and antony flew  although kant held that the argument from morality was valid  the theist response has been either to contend  as does alvin plantinga  that faith is  properly basic   or to take  as does richard swinburne  the evidentialist some theists agree that only some of the arguments for god s existence are compelling  but argue that faith is not a product of reason  but requires risk  there would be no risk  they say  if the arguments for god s existence were as solid as the laws of logic  a position summed up by pascal as  the heart has reasons of which reason does not religious believers allow for the existence of other  less powerful spiritual beings such as angels  saints  jinn  demons  and
