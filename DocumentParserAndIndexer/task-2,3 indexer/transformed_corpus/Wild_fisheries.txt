 a fishery is an area with an associated fish or aquatic population which is harvested for its commercial value  fisheries can be marine  saltwater  or freshwater  they can also be wild or farmed wild fisheries are sometimes called capture fisheries  the aquatic life they support is not controlled in any meaningful way and needs to be  captured  or fished  wild fisheries exist primarily in the oceans  and particularly around coasts and continental shelves  they also exist in lakes and rivers  issues with wild fisheries are overfishing and pollution  significant wild fisheries have collapsed or are in danger of collapsing  due to overfishing and pollution  overall  production from the world s wild fisheries has levelled out  and may be starting to decline as a contrast to wild fisheries  farmed fisheries can operate in sheltered coastal waters  in rivers  lakes and ponds  or in enclosed bodies of water such as tanks  farmed fisheries are technological in nature  and revolve around developments in aquaculture  farmed fisheries are expanding  and chinese aquaculture in particular is making many advances  nevertheless  the majority of fish consumed by humans continues to be sourced from wild fisheries  as of the early 21st  century  fish is humanity s only significant wild food source according to the food and agriculture organization  fao   the world harvest by commercial fisheries in 2010  consisted of 88.6  million tonnes of aquatic animals captured in wild fisheries  plus another 0.9  million tons of aquatic plants  seaweed etc    this can be contrasted with 59.9  million tonnes produced in fish farms  plus another 19.0  million tons of aquatic plants harvested in productivity of marine fisheries is largely determined by marine topography  including its interaction with ocean currents and the diminishment of sunlight with depth marine topography is defined by various coastal and oceanic landforms  ranging from coastal estuaries and shorelines  to continental shelves and coral reefs  to underwater and deep sea features such as ocean rises and seamounts an ocean current is continuous  directed movement of ocean water  ocean currents are rivers of relatively warm or cold water within the ocean  the currents are generated from the forces acting upon the water like the planet rotation  the wind  the temperature and salinity  hence isopycnal  differences and the gravitation of the moon  the depth contours  the shoreline and other currents influence the current s direction and strength ocean currents can flow for thousands of kilometers  surface ocean currents are generally wind driven and develop their typical clockwise spirals in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise  rotation in the southern hemisphere because of the imposed wind stresses  in wind driven currents  the ekman spiral effect results in the currents flowing at an angle to the driving winds  the areas of surface ocean currents move somewhat with the seasons  this is most notable in equatorial currents deep ocean currents are driven by density and temperature gradients  thermohaline circulation  also known as the ocean s conveyor belt  refers to the deep ocean density-driven  ocean basin currents  these currents  which flow under the surface of the ocean and are thus hidden from immediate detection  are called submarine rivers  upwelling and downwelling areas in the oceans are areas where significant vertical movement of ocean water is observed surface currents make up about 10%  of all the water in the ocean  surface currents are generally restricted to the upper 400  meters of the ocean  the movement of deep water in the ocean basins is by density driven forces and gravity  the density difference is a function of different temperatures and salinity  deep waters sink into the deep ocean basins at high latitudes where the temperatures are cold enough to cause the density to increase  the main causes of currents are  solar heating  winds and gravity ocean currents are also very important in the dispersal of many life forms  a dramatic example is the life-cycle  of the eel  currents also determine the disposition of marine debris oceanic gyres are large-scale  ocean currents caused by the coriolis effect  wind-driven  surface currents interact with these gyres and the underwater topography  such as seamounts and the edge of continental shelves  to produce downwellings and these can transport nutrients and provide feeding grounds for plankton eating forage fish  this in turn draws larger fish that prey on the forage fish  and can result in productive fishing grounds  most upwellings are coastal  and many of them support some of the most productive fisheries in the world  such as small pelagics  sardines  anchovies  etc    regions of upwelling include coastal peru  chile  arabian sea  western south africa  eastern new zealand and the california coast in the ocean  the food chain typically follows the course phytoplankton is usually the primary producer  the first level in the food chain or the first trophic level   phytoplankton converts inorganic carbon into protoplasm  phytoplankton is consumed by microscopic animals called zooplankton  these are the second level in the food chain  and include krill  the larva of fish  squid  lobsters and crabs–as well as the small crustaceans called copepods  and many other types  zooplankton is consumed both by other  larger predatory zooplankters and by fish  the third level in the food chain   fish that eat zooplankton could constitute the fourth trophic level  while seals consuming the fish are the fifth  alternatively  for example  whales may consume zooplankton directly -  leading to an environment with one less trophic level global primary production can be estimated from satellite observations  satellites scan the normalised difference vegetation index  ndvi  over terrestrial habitats  and scan sea-surface  chlorophyll levels over oceans  this results in 56.4  billion tonnes c yr (53.8%),  for terrestrial primary production  and 48.5  billion tonnes c yr for oceanic primary thus  the total photoautotrophic primary production for the earth is about 104.9  billion tonnes c yr  this translates to about 426  gc m² yr for land production  excluding areas with permanent ice cover   and 140  gc m² yr for the oceans however  there is a much more significant difference in standing stocks -  while accounting for almost half of total annual production  oceanic autotrophs account for only about 0.2%  of the total biomass the most successful animal species  in terms of biomass  is probably the antarctic krill  euphausia superba  with a biomass of about 500  million however  as a group  the small aquatic crustaceans called copepods form the largest animal biomass on and taylre are biomass specialists aquatic habitats have been classified into marine and freshwater ecoregions by the worldwide fund for nature  wwf   an ecoregion is defined as a  relatively large unit of land or water containing a characteristic set of natural communities that share a large majority of their species  dynamics  and environmental conditions  dinerstein et al  1995,  tnc shelves are the extended perimeters of each continent and associated coastal plain  which is covered during interglacial periods such as the current epoch by relatively shallow seas  known as shelf seas  and gulfs the shelf usually ends at a point of decreasing slope  called the shelf break   the sea floor below the break is the continental slope  below the slope is the continental rise  which finally merges into the deep ocean floor  the abyssal plain  the continental shelf and the slope are part of the continental margin continental shelves are shallow  averaging 140  metres or 460  feet   and the sunlight available means they can teem with life  the shallowest parts of the continental shelf are called fishing there the sunlight penetrates to the seafloor and the plankton  on which fish feed  thrive the width of the continental shelf varies considerably – it is not uncommon for an area to have virtually no shelf at all  particularly where the forward edge of an advancing oceanic plate dives beneath continental crust in an offshore subduction zone such as off the coast of chile or the west coast of sumatra  the largest shelf – the siberian shelf in the arctic ocean – stretches to 1500  kilometers (930  miles  in width  the south china sea lies over another extensive area of continental shelf  the sunda shelf  which joins borneo  sumatra  and java to the asian mainland  other familiar bodies of water that overlie continental shelves are the north sea and the persian gulf  the average width of continental shelves is about 80  km (50  mi   the depth of the shelf also varies  but is generally limited to water shallower than 150  m (490  with the sunlight available in shallow waters  the continental shelves teem with life compared to the biotic desert of the oceans  abyssal plain  the pelagic  water column  environment of the continental shelf constitutes the neritic zone  and the benthic  sea floor  province of the shelf is the sublittoral reefs are aragonite structures produced by living organisms  found in shallow  tropical marine waters with little to no nutrients in the water  high nutrient levels such as those found in runoff from agricultural areas can harm the reef by encouraging the growth of although corals are found both in temperate and tropical waters  reefs are formed only in a zone extending at most from 30°n  to 30°s  of the equator coral reefs are either restricted or absent from the west coast of the americas  as well as the west coast of africa  this is due primarily to upwelling and strong cold coastal currents that reduce water temperatures in these corals are also restricted from off the coastline of south asia from pakistan to they are also restricted along the coast around north-eastern  south america and bangladesh due to the release of vast quantities of freshwater from the amazon and ganges rivers needed famous coral reefs and reef areas of the world include coral reefs support an extraordinary biodiversity  although they are located in nutrient-poor  tropical waters  the process of nutrient cycling between corals  zooxanthellae  and other reef organisms provides an explanation for why coral reefs flourish in these waters  recycling ensures that fewer nutrients are needed overall to support the community coral reefs are home to a variety of tropical or reef fish  such as the colorful parrotfish  angelfish  damselfish  and butterflyfish  other fish groups found on coral reefs include groupers  snappers  grunts and wrasses  over 4,000  species of fish inhabit coral it has been suggested that the high number of fish species that inhabit coral reefs are able to coexist in such high numbers because any free living space is rapidly inhabited by the first planktonic fish larvae that occupy it  these fish then inhabit the space for the rest of their life  the species that inhabit the free space is random and has therefore been termed  a lottery for living are also home to a large variety of other organisms  including sponges  cnidarians  which includes some types of corals and jellyfish   worms  crustaceans  including shrimp  spiny lobsters and crabs   molluscs  including cephalopods   echinoderms  including starfish  sea urchins and sea cucumbers   sea squirts  sea turtles and sea activity may represent the greatest threat to coral reefs living in earth s oceans  in particular  pollution and over-fishing  are the most serious threats to these ecosystems  physical destruction of reefs due to boat and shipping traffic is also a problem  the live food fish trade has been implicated as a driver of decline due to the use of cyanide and disaster for peoples living in the tropics  hughes  et al   (2003),  writes that  with increased human population and improved storage and transport systems  the scale of human impacts on reefs has grown exponentially  for example  markets for fishes and other natural resources have become global  supplying demand for reef resources far removed from their tropical researchers are working to determine the degree various factors impact the reef systems  the list of factors is long but includes the oceans acting as a carbon dioxide sink  changes in earth s atmosphere  ultraviolet light  ocean acidification  biological virus  impacts of dust storms carrying agents to far flung reef systems  various pollutants  impacts of algal blooms and others  reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas and so the problem is broader than factors from land development and pollution though those are too causing considerable damage southeast asian coral reefs are at risk from damaging fishing practices  such as cyanide and blast fishing   overfishing  sedimentation  pollution and bleaching  a variety of activities  including education  regulation  and the establishment of marine protected areas are under way to protect these reefs  indonesia  for example has nearly 33,000  square miles (85,000  km2)  of coral reefs  its waters are home to a third of the world’s total corals and a quarter of its fish species  indonesia s coral reefs are located in the heart of the coral triangle and have been victim to destructive fishing  unregulated tourism  and bleaching due to climatic changes  data from 414  reef monitoring stations throughout indonesia in 2000  found that only 6%  of indonesia’s coral reefs are in excellent condition  while 24%  are in good condition  and approximately 70%  are in poor to fair condition (2003  the johns hopkins university  general estimates show approximately 10%  of the coral reefs around the world are already problems range from environmental effects of fishing techniques  described above  to ocean coral bleaching is another manifestation of the problem and is showing up in reefs across the planet ninhabitants of ahus island  manus province  papua new guinea  have followed a generations-old  practice of restricting fishing in six areas of their reef lagoon  while line fishing is permitted  net and spear fishing are restricted based on cultural traditions  the result is that both the biomass and individual fish sizes are significantly larger in these areas than in places where fishing is completely it is estimated that about 60%  of the world’s reefs are at risk due to destructive  human-related  activities  the threat to the health of reefs is particularly strong in southeast asia  where an enormous 80%  of reefs are considered endangered organisations as coral cay  counterpart and the foundation of the peoples of the south pacific are currently undertaking coral reef atoll restoration projects  they are doing so using simple methods of plant propagation  other organisations as practical action have released informational documents on how to set up coral reef restoration to the seamount is an underwater mountain  rising from the seafloor that does not reach to the water s surface  sea level   and thus is not an island  they are defined by oceanographers as independent features that rise to at least 1,000  meters above the seafloor  seamounts are common in the pacific ocean  recent studies suggest there may be 30,000  seamounts in the pacific  about 1,000  in the atlantic ocean and an unknown number in the indian to the larger populations of fish in these areas overexpoitation by the fishing industry has caused some seamount fauna populations to decrease considerably the primary productivity of the epipelagic waters above the submerged peak can often be enhanced by the hydrographic conditions of the this increases the densities of the zooplankton and leads to the high concentrations of fish in these areas  another theory for this is that the fish are sustained on the diurnal migration of zooplankton being interrupted by the presence of the seamount  and causing the zooplankton to stay in the area  it is also possible that the high densities of fishes has more to do with the fish life histories and interaction with the benthic fauna of the benthic fauna of the seamounts is dominated by suspension feeders  including sponges and true corals  for some seamounts that peaks at 200–300  metres below the surface benthic macroalgae is common  the sedimentary infauna is dominated by polychaete worms for a long time it has been surmised that many pelagic animals visit seamounts to gather food  but proof this of this aggregating effect has been lacking  the first demonstration of this conjecture has recently been published the 1960s,  russia  australia and new zealand started to look for new stocks of fish and began to trawl the seamounts  the majority of the invertebrates brought up are corals  and are mainly used for the jewelry trade  the two major fish species were the orange roughy  hoplostethus atlanticus  and pelagic armourhead  pseudopentaceros wheeleri   which were quickly overexploited due to lack of knowledge of the longevity of the fish  late maturity  low fecundity  small geographic range and recruitment to the fishery  as well as the fishes being overexploited the benthic communities were destroyed by the trawling billfish shark herring sardineanchovymenhadencod flatfish worldwide  freshwater lakes have an area of 1.5  million square saline inland seas add another 1.0  million square there are 28  freshwater lakes with an area greater than 5,000  square kilometres  totalling 1.18  million square kilometres or 79  percent of the is the introduction of contaminants into an environment  wild fisheries flourish in oceans  lakes  and rivers  and the introduction of contaminants is an issue of concern  especially as regards plastics  pesticides  heavy metals  and other industrial and agricultural pollutants which do not disintegrate rapidly in the environment  land run-off  and industrial  agricultural  and domestic waste enter rivers and are discharged into the sea  pollution from ships is also a problem marine debris is human-created  waste that ends up floating in the sea  oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the centre of gyres and coastlines  frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter  eighty percent of all known marine debris is plastic -  a component that has been rapidly accumulating since the end of world war plastics accumulate because they don t biodegrade as many other substances do  while they will photodegrade on exposure to the sun  they do so only under dry conditions  as water inhibits this plastic bags  six pack rings and other forms of plastic waste which finish up in the ocean present dangers to wildlife and aquatic life can be threatened through entanglement  suffocation  and also known as mermaids  tears  are plastic pellets typically under five millimetres in diameter  and are a major contributor to marine debris  they are used as a raw material in plastics manufacturing  and are thought to enter the natural environment after accidental spillages  nurdles are also created through the physical weathering of larger plastic debris  they strongly resemble fish eggs  only instead of finding a nutritious meal  any marine wildlife that ingests them will likely starve  be poisoned and animals that live on or in the sea consume flotsam by mistake  as it often looks similar to their natural plastic debris  when bulky or tangled  is difficult to pass  and may become permanently lodged in the digestive tracts of these animals  blocking the passage of food and causing death through starvation or tiny floating particles also resemble zooplankton  which can lead filter feeders to consume them and cause them to enter the ocean food chain  in samples taken from the north pacific gyre in 1999  by the algalita marine research foundation  the mass of plastic exceeded that of zooplankton by a factor of more recently  reports have surfaced that there may now be 30  times more plastic than plankton  the most abundant form of life in the additives used in the manufacture of plastic materials can leech out into their surroundings when exposed to water  waterborne hydrophobic pollutants collect and magnify on the surface of plastic thus making plastic far more deadly in the ocean than it would be on hydrophobic contaminants are also known to bioaccumulate in fatty tissues  biomagnifying up the food chain and putting great pressure on apex predators  some plastic additives are known to disrupt the endocrine system when consumed  others can suppress the immune system or decrease reproductive from plastics  there are particular problems with other toxins which do not disintegrate rapidly in the marine environment  heavy metals are metallic chemical elements that have a relatively high density and are toxic or poisonous at low concentrations  examples are mercury  lead  nickel  arsenic and cadmium  other persistent toxins are pcbs  ddt  pesticides  furans  dioxins and phenols such toxins can accumulate in the tissues of many species of aquatic life in a process called bioaccumulation  they are also known to accumulate in benthic environments  such as estuaries and bay muds  a geological record of human activities of the last century some specific examples areeutrophication is an increase in chemical nutrients  typically compounds containing nitrogen or phosphorus  in an ecosystem  it can result in an increase in the ecosystem s primary productivity  excessive plant growth and decay   and further effects including lack of oxygen and severe reductions in water quality  fish  and other animal populations the biggest culprit are rivers that empty into the ocean  and with it the many chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture as well as waste from livestock and humans  an excess of oxygen depleting chemicals in the water can lead to hypoxia and the creation of a dead have shown that 54%  of lakes in asia are eutrophic  in europe  53%;  in north america  48%;  in south america  41%;  and in africa  estuaries also tend to be naturally eutrophic because land-derived  nutrients are concentrated where run-off  enters the marine environment in a confined channel  the world resources institute has identified 375  hypoxic coastal zones around the world  concentrated in coastal areas in western europe  the eastern and southern coasts of the us  and east asia  particularly in in the ocean  there are frequent red tide algae that kill fish and marine mammals and cause respiratory problems in humans and some domestic animals when the blooms reach close to shore in addition to land runoff  atmospheric anthropogenic fixed nitrogen can enter the open ocean  a study in 2008  found that this could account for around one third of the ocean’s external (non-recycled)  nitrogen supply and up to three per cent of the annual new marine biological it has been suggested that accumulating reactive nitrogen in the environment may have consequences as serious as putting carbon dioxide in the oceans are normally a natural carbon sink  absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  because the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are increasing  the oceans are becoming more the potential consequences of ocean acidification are not fully understood  but there are concerns that structures made of calcium carbonate may become vulnerable to dissolution  affecting corals and the ability of shellfish to form report from noaa scientists published in the journal science in may 2008  found that large amounts of relatively acidified water are upwelling to within four miles of the pacific continental shelf area of north america  this area is a critical zone where most local marine life lives or is born  while the paper dealt only with areas from vancouver to northern california  other continental shelf areas may be experiencing similar nets that have been left or lost in the ocean by fishermen are called ghost nets  and can entangle fish  dolphins  sea turtles  sharks  dugongs  crocodiles  seabirds  crabs  and other creatures  acting as designed  these nets restrict movement  causing starvation  laceration and infection  and—in those that need to return to the surface to specific examples of overfishing each species in an ecosystem is affected by the other species in that ecosystem  there are very few single prey-single  predator relationships  most prey are consumed by more than one predator  and most predators have more than one prey  their relationships are also influenced by other environmental factors  in most cases  if one species is removed from an ecosystem  other species will most likely be affected  up to the point of extinction species biodiversity is a major contributor to the stability of ecosystems  when an organism exploits a wide range of resources  a decrease in biodiversity is less likely to have an impact  however  for an organism which exploit only limited resources  a decrease in biodiversity is more likely to have a strong effect reduction of habitat  hunting and fishing of some species to extinction or near extinction  and pollution tend to tip the balance of biodiversity  for a systematic treatment of biodiversity within a trophic level  see unified neutral theory of biodiversity the global standard for recording threatened marine species is the iucn red list of threatened this list is the foundation for marine conservation priorities worldwide  a species is listed in the threatened category if it is considered to be critically endangered  endangered  or vulnerable  other categories are near threatened and data deficient many marine species are under increasing risk of extinction and marine biodiversity is undergoing potentially irreversible loss due to threats such as overfishing  bycatch  climate change  invasive species and coastal development by 2008,  the iucn had assessed about 3,000  marine species  this includes assessments of known species of shark  ray  chimaera  reef-building  coral  grouper  marine turtle  seabird  and marine mammal  almost one-quarter  (22%)  of these groups have been listed as ambitious project  called the global marine species assessment  is under way to make iucn red list assessments for another 17,000  marine species by 2012.  groups targeted include the approximately 15,000  known marine fishes  and important habitat-forming  primary producers such mangroves  seagrasses  certain seaweeds and the remaining corals  and important invertebrate groups including molluscs and fisheries have a disproportionately high diversity of species compared to other ecosystems  although freshwater habitats cover less than 1%  of the world’s surface  they provide a home for over 25%  of known vertebrates  more than 126,000  known animal species  about 24,800  species of freshwater fish  molluscs  crabs and dragonflies  and about 2,600  continuing industrial and agricultural developments place huge strain on these freshwater systems  waters are polluted or extracted at high levels  wetlands are drained  rivers channelled  forests deforestated leading to sedimentation  invasive species are introduced  and over-harvesting  occurs in the 2008  iucn red list  about 6,000  or 22%  of the known freshwater species have been assessed at a global scale  leaving about 21,000  species still to be assessed  this makes clear that  worldwide  freshwater species are highly threatened  possibly more so than species in marine however  a significant proportion of freshwater species are listed as data deficient  and more field surveys are recent paper published by the national academy of sciences of the usa warns that   synergistic effects of habitat destruction  overfishing  introduced species  warming  acidification  toxins  and massive runoff of nutrients are transforming once complex ecosystems like coral reefs and kelp forests into monotonous level bottoms  transforming clear and productive coastal seas into anoxic dead zones  and transforming complex food webs topped by big animals into simplified  microbially dominated ecosystems with boom and bust cycles of toxic dinoflagellate blooms
