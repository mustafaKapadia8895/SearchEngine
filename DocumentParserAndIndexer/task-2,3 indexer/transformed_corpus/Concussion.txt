 concussion  also known as minor head trauma or mild traumatic brain injury  mtbi  is the most common type of traumatic brain injury  it is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function  symptoms include a variety of physical  cognitive  and emotional symptoms  which may not be recognized if subtle  a variety of signs accompany concussion including headache  feeling in a fog  and emotional changeability  in general  the signs can be categorized into physical signs  such as loss of consciousness or amnesia   behavioral changes  such as irritability   cognitive impairment  such as slowed reaction times   and sleep fewer than 10%  of sports-related  concussions among children are associated with loss of causes include sports injuries  bicycle accidents  car accidents  and falls  the latter two being the most frequent causes among in addition to a blow to the head  concussion may be caused by acceleration forces without a direct impact  and on the battlefield  mtbi is a potential consequence of nearby it is not clear exactly what damage is done and how the symptoms are caused  but stretching of axons and changes in ion channels are cellular damage has reportedly been found in concussed brains  but it may have been due to artifacts from the it is currently thought that structural and neuropsychiatric factors may both be responsible for the effects of involves monitoring as well as physical and cognitive rest  reduction of such activities as school work  playing video games and text symptoms usually resolve within three weeks  though they may persist or complications may rate at which concussion occurs is not accurately known  but is estimated to be more than 6  per 1,000  those who have had one concussion seem more susceptible to another  especially if the new injury occurs before symptoms from the previous concussion have completely there is also a negative progressive process in which smaller impacts cause the same symptom repeated concussions may increase the risk in later life for dementia  parkinson s disease  or is associated with a variety of symptoms  which typically occur rapidly after the early symptoms usually subside within days or the number and type of symptoms any one individual suffers varies is the most common mtbi others include dizziness  vomiting  nausea  lack of motor coordination  difficulty or other problems with movement or sensation  visual symptoms include light seeing bright blurred and double tinnitus  or a ringing in the ears  is also commonly in one in about seventy concussions  concussive convulsions occur  but seizures that take place during or immediately after concussion are not "post-traumatic  seizures   and  unlike post-traumatic  seizures  are not predictive of post-traumatic  epilepsy  which requires some form of structural brain damage  not just a momentary disruption in normal brain concussive convulsions are thought to result from temporary loss or inhibition of motor function  and are not associated either with epilepsy or with more serious structural damage  they are not associated with any particular sequelae  and have the same high rate of favorable outcomes as concussions without symptoms include confusion  disorientation  and difficulty focusing attention  loss of consciousness may occur  but is not necessarily correlated with the severity of the concussion if it is post-traumatic  amnesia  in which events following the injury cannot be recalled  is a hallmark of confusion  another concussion hallmark  may be present immediately or may develop over several a person may repeat the same be slow to respond to questions or directions  have a vacant stare  or have or incoherent other mtbi symptoms include changes in sleeping and difficulty with concentrating  and performing everyday can result in changes in mood including crankiness  loss of interest in favorite activities or and displays of emotion that are inappropriate to the common symptoms in concussed children include restlessness  lethargy  and brain is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid  which protects it from light trauma  more severe impacts  or the forces associated with rapid acceleration  may not be absorbed by this concussion may be caused by impact forces  in which the head strikes or is struck by something  or impulsive forces  in which the head moves without itself being subject to blunt trauma  for example  when the chest hits something and the head snaps may cause linear  rotational  or angular movement of the brain  or a combination of in rotational movement  the head turns around its center of gravity  and in angular movement it turns on an axis not through its center of the amount of rotational force is thought to be the major component in and its studies with athletes have shown that the amount of force and the location of the impact are not necessarily correlated with the severity of the concussion or its symptoms  and have called into question the threshold for concussion previously thought to exist at around 70–75  parts of the brain most affected by rotational forces are the midbrain and it is thought that the forces from the injury disrupt the normal cellular activities in the reticular activating system located in these areas  and that this disruption produces the loss of consciousness often seen in other areas of the brain that may be affected include the upper part of the brain stem  the fornix  the corpus callosum  the temporal lobe  and the frontal angular accelerations of 4600,  5900,  or 7900  radian/s2  are estimated to have 25,  50,  or 80%  risk of mtbi both animals and humans  mtbi can alter the brain s physiology for hours to setting into motion a variety of pathological as one example  in animal models  after an initial increase in glucose metabolism  there is a subsequent reduced metabolic state which may persist for up to four weeks after though these events are thought to interfere with neuronal and brain function  the metabolic processes that follow concussion are reversible in a large majority of affected brain cells  however  a few cells may die after the in the cascade of events unleashed in the brain by concussion is impaired neurotransmission  loss of regulation of ions  deregulation of energy use and cellular metabolism  and a reduction in cerebral blood excitatory neurotransmitters  chemicals such as glutamate that serve to stimulate nerve cells  are released in excessive the resulting cellular excitation causes neurons to fire this creates an imbalance of ions such as potassium and calcium across the cell membranes of neurons  a process like the same time  cerebral blood flow is relatively reduced for unknown though the reduction in blood flow is not as severe as it is in thus cells get less glucose than they normally do  which causes an  energy with these processes  the activity of mitochondria may be reduced  which causes cells to rely on anaerobic metabolism to produce energy  increasing levels of the byproduct a period of minutes to days after a concussion  the brain is especially vulnerable to changes in intracranial pressure  blood flow  and according to studies performed on animals  which are not always applicable to humans   large numbers of neurons can die during this period in response to slight  normally innocuous changes in blood involves diffuse  as opposed to focal  brain injury  meaning that the dysfunction occurs over a widespread area of the brain rather than in a particular it is thought to be a milder type of diffuse axonal injury  because axons may be injured to a minor extent due to animal studies in which primates were concussed have revealed damage to brain tissues such as small petechial hemorrhages and axonal axonal damage has been found in the brains of concussion sufferers who died from other causes  but inadequate blood flow to the brain due to other injuries may have findings from a study of the brains of deceased nfl athletes who received concussions suggest that lasting damage is done by such injuries  this damage  the severity of which increases with the cumulative number of concussions sustained  can lead to a variety of other health debate over whether concussion is a functional or structural phenomenon is structural damage has been found in the mildly traumatically injured brains of animals  but it is not clear whether these findings would apply to such changes in brain structure could be responsible for certain symptoms such as visual disturbances  but other sets of symptoms  especially those of a psychological nature  are more likely to be caused by reversible pathophysiological changes in cellular function that occur after concussion  such as alterations in neurons  these reversible changes could also explain why dysfunction is frequently a task force of head injury experts called the concussion in sport group met in 2001  and decided that  concussion may result in neuropathological changes but the acute clinical symptoms largely reflect a functional disturbance rather than structural summary  and extrapolating from animal studies  the pathology of a concussion seems to start with the disruption of the cell membrane of nerve cells  this results in a migration of potassium from within the cell into the extracellular space with subsequent release of glutamate which potentiates further potassium shift  in turn resulting in depolarization and suppression of nerve activity  in an effort to restore ion balance  the sodium-potassium  ion pumps increase activity  which results in excessive atp  adenosine triphosphate  consumption and glucose utilization  lactate accumulates but  paradoxically  cerebral blood flow decreases  which leads to a proposed  energy crisis   after this increase in glucose metabolism  there is a subsequent lower metabolic state which may persist for up to 4  weeks after injury  a completely separate pathway involves a large amount of calcium accumulating in cells  which may impair oxidative metabolism and begin further biochemical pathways that result in cell death  again  both of these main pathways have been established from animal studies and the extent to which they apply to humans is still somewhat trauma recipients are initially assessed to exclude a more severe emergency such as an intracranial hemorrhage  this includes the  abcs   airway  breathing  circulation  and stabilization of the cervical spine which is assumed to be injured in any athlete who is found to be unconscious after head or neck injury  indications that screening for more serious injury is needed include worsening of symptoms such as headache  persistent increasing disorientation or a deteriorating level of seizures  and unequal pupil those with such symptoms  or those who are at higher risk for a more serious brain injury  may undergo brain imaging to detect lesions and are frequently observed for 24–48  hours  a brain ct or brain mri should be avoided unless there are progressive neurological symptoms  focal neurological findings or concern of skull fracture on of mtbi is based on physical and neurological examination findings  duration of unconsciousness  usually less than 30  minutes  and post-traumatic  amnesia  pta  usually less than 24  hours   and the glasgow coma scale  mtbi sufferers have scores of 13  to neuropsychological tests exist to measure cognitive function and the international consensus meeting in zurich recommended the use of the scat2  such tests may be administered hours  days  or weeks after the injury  or at different times to demonstrate any increasingly  athletes are also being tested pre-season  to provide a baseline for comparison in the event of an injury  though this may not reduce risk or affect return to the glasgow coma scale is less than 15  at two hours  or less than 14  at any time  a ct is in addition  a ct scan is more likely to be performed if observation after discharge is not assured or intoxication is present  there is suspected increased risk for bleeding  age greater than or less than 16.  most concussions  without complication  cannot be detected with mri or ct however  changes have been reported on mri and spect imaging in those with concussion and normal ct scans  and post-concussion  syndrome may be associated with abnormalities visible on spect and pet mild head injury may or may not produce abnormal eeg may be under-diagnosed  because of the lack of the highly noticeable signs and symptoms while athletes may minimize their injuries to remain in the a retrospective survey in 2005  suggested that more than 88%  of concussions are can be complex because concussion shares symptoms with other conditions  for example  post-concussion  symptoms such as cognitive problems may be misattributed to brain injury when  in fact  due to post-traumatic  stress disorder single definition of concussion  minor head or mild traumatic brain injury is universally in 2001,  the expert concussion in sport group of the first international symposium on concussion in defined concussion as  a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain  induced by traumatic biomechanical it was agreed that concussion typically involves temporary impairment of neurological function that heals by itself within time  and that neuroimaging normally shows no gross structural changes to the brain as the result of the although no structural brain damage occurs according to the classic some researchers have included injuries in which structural damage has occurred and the national institute for health and clinical excellence definition includes physiological or physical disruption in the brain s also  by definition  concussion has historically involved a loss of consciousness  however  the definition has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness  such as although controversy continues about whether the definition should include only those injuries in which loss of consciousness this debate resurfaces in some of the best-known  concussion grading scales  in which those episodes involving loss of consciousness are graded as being more severe than those of mild traumatic brain injury  mtbi  were inconsistent until the world health organization s international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems (icd-10)  provided a consistent  authoritative definition across specialties in since then  various organizations such as the american congress of rehabilitation and the american psychiatric association in its diagnostic and statistical manual of mental have defined mtbi using some combination of loss of consciousness  loc   post-traumatic  amnesia  pta   and the glasgow coma scale  gcs  concussion falls under the classification of mild but it is not clear whether concussion is implied in mild brain injury or mild head update   mtbi  and  concussion  are often treated as synonyms in medical but other injuries such as intracranial hemorrhages  e g  intra-axial  hematoma  epidural hematoma  and subdural hematoma  are not necessarily precluded in or mild head as they are in mtbi associated with abnormal neuroimaging may be considered  complicated  concussion  can be considered to imply a state in which brain function is temporarily impaired and  mtbi  to imply a pathophysiological state  but in practice few researchers and clinicians distinguish between the descriptions of the condition  including the severity and the area of the brain affected  are now used more often than  concussion  in clinical least 41  systems measure the severity  or grade  of a mild head and there is little agreement about which is in an effort to simplify  the 2nd  international conference on concussion in sport  meeting in prague in 2004,  decided that these systems should be abandoned in favor of a  simple  or  complex  however  the 2008  meeting in zurich abandoned the simple versus complex terminology  although the participants did agree to keep the concept that most (80–90%)  concussions resolve in a short period (7–10  days   and although the recovery time frame may be longer in children and the past  the decision to allow athletes to return to participation was frequently based on the grade of concussion  however  current research and recommendations by professional organizations including the national athletic trainers  association recommend against such use of these grading systems  currently  injured athletes are prohibited from returning to play before they are symptom-free  during both rest and exertion and until results of the neuropsychological tests have returned to pre-injury  levels three grading systems have been most widely followed  by robert cantu  the colorado medical society  and the american academy of each employs three grades  as summarized in the following of mtbi involves general measures such as wearing seat belts and using airbags in older people are encouraged to reduce fall risk by keeping floors free of clutter and wearing thin  flat  shoes with hard soles that do not interfere with equipment such as headgear has been found to reduce the number of concussions in and improvements in the design of helmets may decrease the number and severity new  head impact telemetry system  technology is being placed in helmets to study injury mechanisms and may generate knowledge that will potentially help reduce the risk of concussions among american football players  self-reported  concussion rates among u-20  and elite rugby union players in ireland are 45–48%.  half of these injuries go unreported  changes to the rules or enforcing existing rules in sports  such as those against "head-down  tackling   or  spearing   which is associated with a high injury rate  may also prevent exclusion of neck injury  observation should be continued for several hours  if repeated vomiting  worsening headache  dizziness  seizure activity  excessive drowsiness  double vision  slurred speech  unsteady walk  or weakness or numbness in arms or legs  or signs of basilar skull fracture develop  immediate assessment in an emergency department is after this initial period has passed  there is debate as to whether it is necessary to awaken the person several times during the first night  as has traditionally been done  or whether there is more benefit from uninterrupted and cognitive rest should be continued until all symptoms have resolved with most (80–90%)  concussions resolving in seven to ten days  although the recovery time may be longer in children and cognitive rest includes reducing activities which require concentration and attention such as school work  video games  and text it has been suggested that even leisure reading can commonly worsen symptoms in children and adolescents and proposals include time off from school and attending partial days  since students may appear  normal   continuing education of relevant school personnel may be with concussion are generally prescribed including adequate nighttime sleep as well as daytime rest includes both physical and cognitive rest until symptoms and a gradual return to normal activities at a pace that does not cause symptoms to worsen is education about symptoms  their management  and their normal time course  can lead to an improved persons participating in athletics  the 2008  zurich consensus statement on concussion in sport recommends that participants be symptom-free  before restarting and then progress through a series of graded steps  these steps include only when symptom-free  for 24  hours  should progression to the next step occur  if symptoms occur  the person should drop back to the previous asymptomatic level for at least another 24  hours  the emphasis is on remaining symptom free and taking it in medium steps  not on the steps may be prescribed to treat sleep problems and analgesics such as ibuprofen can be taken for but paracetamol  acetaminophen  is preferred to minimize the risk of intracranial concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede activation database-guided  eeg biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control one percent of people who receive treatment for mtbi need surgery for a brain observation to monitor for worsening condition is an important part of health care providers recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further medical care and evaluation 24  to 72  hours after the concussive event if the symptoms worsen  athletes  especially intercollegiate or professional  are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have access to this level of health care and may be sent home with minimal monitoring people may be released after assessment from hospital or emergency room to the care of a trusted person with instructions to return if they display worsening or those that might indicate an emergent condition such as  change in consciousness  convulsions  severe headache  extremity weakness  vomiting  new bleeding or deafness in either or both who have had a concussion seem more susceptible to another one  particularly if the new injury occurs before symptoms from the previous concussion have completely gone it is also a negative process if smaller impacts cause the same symptom repeated concussions may increase a person s risk in later life for dementia  parkinson s disease  and has a mortality rate of almost the symptoms of most concussions resolve within weeks  but problems may these are seldom permanent  and outcome is usually the overall prognosis for recovery may be influenced by a variety of factors that include age at the time of injury  intellectual abilities  family environment  social support system  occupational status  coping strategies  and financial people over age 55  may take longer to heal from mtbi or may heal similarly  factors such as a previous head injury or a coexisting medical condition have been found to predict longer-lasting  post-concussion  other factors that may lengthen recovery time after mtbi include psychological problems such as substance abuse or clinical depression  poor health before the injury or additional injuries sustained during it  and life longer periods of amnesia or loss of consciousness immediately after the injury may indicate longer recovery times from residual for unknown reasons  having had one concussion significantly increases a person s risk of having having previously sustained a sports concussion has been found to be a strong factor increasing the likelihood of a concussion in the future  other strong factors include participation in a contact sport and body mass the prognosis may differ between concussed adults and children  little research has been done on concussion in the pediatric population  but concern exists that severe concussions could interfere with brain development in 2009  study found that individuals with a history of concussions might demonstrate a decline in both physical and mental performance for longer than 30  years  compared to their peers with no history of brain trauma  sufferers of concussion exhibited effects including loss of episodic memory and reduced muscle post-concussion  syndrome  symptoms do not resolve for weeks  months  or years after a concussion  and may occasionally be about 10%  to 20%  of people have post concussion syndrome for more than a symptoms may include headaches  dizziness  fatigue  anxiety  memory and attention problems  sleep problems  and there is no scientifically established treatment  and rest  a recommended recovery technique  has limited symptoms usually go away on their own within the question of whether the syndrome is due to structural damage or other factors such as psychological ones  or a combination of these  has long been the subject of effects of concussions are poorly understood  with this being even more true in children  the severity of concussions and their symptoms may worsen with successive injuries  even if a subsequent injury occurs months or years after an initial symptoms may be more severe and changes in neurophysiology can occur with the third and subsequent studies have had conflicting findings on whether athletes have longer recovery times after repeat concussions and whether cumulative effects such as impairment in cognition and memory effects may include psychiatric disorders and loss of long-term  memory  for example  the risk of developing clinical depression has been found to be significantly greater for retired american football players with a history of three or more concussions than for those with no concussion three or more concussions is also associated with a fivefold greater chance of developing alzheimer s disease earlier and a threefold greater chance of developing memory traumatic encephalopathy  or  cte   is an example of the cumulative damage that can occur as the result of multiple concussions or less severe blows to the head  the condition was previously referred to as  dementia pugilistica   or  punch drunk  syndrome  as it was first noted in boxers  the disease can lead to cognitive and physical handicaps such as parkinsonism  speech and memory problems  slowed mental processing  tremor  depression  and inappropriate it shares features with alzheimer s syndrome  in which the brain swells dangerously after a minor blow  may occur in very rare cases  the condition may develop in people who receive a second blow days or weeks after an initial concussion  before its symptoms have gone no one is certain of the cause of this often fatal complication  but it is commonly thought that the swelling occurs because the brain s arterioles lose the ability to regulate their diameter  causing a loss of control over cerebral blood as the brain swells  intracranial pressure rapidly the brain can herniate  and the brain stem can fail within five except in boxing  all cases have occurred in athletes under age due to the very small number of documented cases  the diagnosis is controversial  and doubt exists about its a 2010  pediatrics review article stated that there is debate whether the brain swelling is due to two separate hits or to just one hit  but in either case  catastrophic football head injuries are three times more likely in high school athletes than in college cases of traumatic brain injury are concussions  a world health organization  who  study estimated that between 70  and 90%  of head injuries that receive treatment are however  due to underreporting and to the widely varying definitions of concussion and mtbi  it is difficult to estimate how common the condition estimates of the incidence of concussion may be artificially low  for example due to underreporting  at least 25%  of mtbi sufferers fail to get assessed by a medical the who group reviewed studies on the epidemiology of mtbi and found a hospital treatment rate of 1–3  per 1000  people  but since not all concussions are treated in hospitals  they estimated that the rate per year in the general population is over 6  per 1000  children have the highest concussion rate among all age however  most people who suffer concussion are young a canadian study found that the yearly incidence of mtbi is lower in older age groups  graph at studies suggest males suffer mtbi at about twice the rate of their female however  female athletes may be at a higher risk for suffering concussion than their male to five percent of sports injuries are the u s  centers for disease control and prevention estimates that 300,000  sports-related  concussions occur yearly in the u s   but that number includes only athletes who lost since loss of consciousness is thought to occur in less than 10%  of the cdc estimate is likely lower than the real sports in which concussion is particularly common include football and boxing  a boxer aims to  knock out   i e  give a mild traumatic brain injury to  the opponent   the injury is so common in the latter that several medical groups have called for a ban on the sport  including the american academy of neurology  the world medical association  and the medical associations of the uk  the us  australia  and to the lack of a consistent definition  the economic costs of mtbi are not known  but they are estimated to be very these high costs are due in part to the large percentage of hospital admissions for head injury that are due to mild head but indirect costs such as lost work time and early retirement account for the bulk of the these direct and indirect costs cause the expense of mild brain trauma to rival that of moderate and severe head hippocratic corpus  collection of medical works from ancient greece  mentions concussion  later translated to commotio cerebri  and discusses loss of speech  hearing and sight that can result from  commotion of the this idea of disruption of mental function by  shaking of the brain  remained the widely accepted understanding of concussion until the 19th  the persian physician muhammad ibn zakarīya rāzi was the first to write about concussion as distinct from other types of head injury in the 10th  century he may have been the first to use the term  cerebral concussion   and his definition of the condition  a transient loss of function with no physical damage  set the stage for the medical understanding of the condition for in the 13th  century  the physician lanfranc of milan s chiurgia magna described concussion as brain  commotion   also recognizing a difference between concussion and other types of traumatic brain injury  though many of his contemporaries did not   and discussing the transience of post-concussion  symptoms as a result of temporary loss of function from the in the 14th  century  the surgeon guy de chauliac pointed out the relatively good prognosis of concussion as compared to more severe types of head trauma such as skull fractures and penetrating head in the 16th  century  the term  concussion  came into use  and symptoms such as confusion  lethargy  and memory problems were the 16th  century physician ambroise paré used the term commotio as well as  shaking of the brain    commotion   and the 17th  century  concussion was usually described by its clinical features  but after the invention of the microscope  more physicians began exploring underlying physical and structural however  the prevailing view in the 17th  century was that the injury did not result from physical damage  and this view continued to be widely held throughout the 18th  the word  concussion  was used at the time to describe the state of unconsciousness and other functional problems that resulted from the impact  rather than a physiological 1839,  guillaume dupuytren described brain contusions  which involve many small hemorrhages  as contusio cerebri and showed the difference between unconsciousness associated with damage to the brain parenchyma and that due to concussion  without such in 1941,  animal experiments showed that no macroscopic damage occurs in terms mild brain injury  mild traumatic brain injury  mtbi   mild head injury  mhi   and concussion may be used although the term  concussion  is still used in sports literature as interchangeable with  mhi  or  mtbi   the general clinical medical literature uses  mtbi  instead  since a 2003  cdc report outlined it as an important in this article   concussion  and  mtbi  are used interchangeably the term is from the latin concutere meaning  to shake or concussus meaning  action of
