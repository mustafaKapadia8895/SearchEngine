scriptures associated with hinduism began to be composed  social stratification  based on caste  emerged in the first millennium bce  and buddhism and jainism arose  early political consolidations took place under the maurya and gupta empires  the later peninsular middle kingdoms influenced cultures as far as southeast asia  in the medieval era  judaism  zoroastrianism  christianity  and islam arrived  and sikhism emerged  all adding to the region s diverse culture  much of the north fell to the delhi sultanate  the south was united under the vijayanagara empire  the economy expanded in the 17th  century in the mughal empire  in the mid-18th  century  the subcontinent came under british east india company rule  and in the mid-19th  under british crown rule  a nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th  century  which later  under mahatma gandhi  was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to india s independence in 1947.in  2017,  the indian economy was the world s sixth largest by nominal gdp and third largest by purchasing power following market-based  economic reforms in 1991,  india became one of the fastest-growing  major economies and is considered a newly industrialised

it is a pluralistic  multilingual and multi-ethnic  society and is also home to a diversity of wildlife in a variety of protected habitats the name india is derived from indus  which originates from the old persian word the latter term stems from the sanskrit word sindhu  which was the historical local appellation for the indus the ancient greeks referred to the indians as indoi  ἰνδοί   which translates as  the people of the geographical term bharat  bhārat  pronounced   listen    which is recognised by the constitution of india as an official name for the is used by many indian languages in its variations  it is a modernisation of the historical name bharatavarsha  which traditionally referred to the indian subcontinent and gained increasing currency from the mid-19th  century as a native name for scholars believe it to be named after the vedic tribe of bhāratas in the second millennium it is also traditionally associated with the rule of the legendary emperor gaṇarājya  literally  people s state  is the sanskrit hindi term for  republic  dating back to the ancient   listen   is a persian name for india dating back to the 3rd  century bce  it was introduced into india by the mughals and widely used since then  its meaning varied  referring to a region that encompassed northern india and pakistan or india in its currently  the name may refer to either the northern part of india or the entire earliest authenticated human remains in south asia date to about 30,000  years nearly contemporaneous mesolithic rock art sites have been found in many parts of the indian subcontinent  including at the bhimbetka rock shelters in madhya around 7000  bce  one of the first known neolithic settlements appeared on the subcontinent in mehrgarh and other sites in the these gradually developed into the indus valley the first urban culture in south it flourished during 2500–1900  bce in northeast afghanistan to pakistan and northwest india  centred around cities such as mohenjo-daro,  harappa  dholavira  and kalibangan  and relying on varied forms of subsistence  the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging  the period 2000–500  bce  in terms of culture  many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the chalcolithic to the iron the vedas  the oldest scriptures associated with were composed during this and historians have analysed these to posit a vedic culture in the punjab region and the upper gangetic most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of indo-aryan  migration into the subcontinent from the the caste system  which created a hierarchy of priests  warriors  and free peasants  but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure  arose during this on the deccan plateau  archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political in south india  a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this as well as by nearby traces of agriculture  irrigation tanks  and craft the late vedic period  around the 6th  century bce  the small states and chiefdoms of the ganges plain and the north-western  regions had consolidated into 16  major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the the emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-vedic  religious movements  two of which became independent religions  jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar  buddhism  based on the teachings of gautama buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class  chronicling the life of the buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in in an age of increasing urban wealth  both religions held up renunciation as an and both established long-lasting  monastic traditions  politically  by the 3rd  century bce  the kingdom of magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the mauryan the empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south  but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous the mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building  and determined management of public life as for ashoka s renunciation of militarism and far-flung  advocacy of the buddhist sangam literature of the tamil language reveals that  between 200  bce and 200  ce  the southern peninsula was being ruled by the cheras  the cholas  and the pandyas  dynasties that traded extensively with the roman empire and with west and south-east  in north india  hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family  leading to increased subordination of by the 4th  and 5th  centuries  the gupta empire had created in the greater ganges plain a complex system of administration and taxation that became a model for later indian under the guptas  a renewed hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert the renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture  which found patrons among an urban classical sanskrit literature flowered as well  and indian science  astronomy  medicine  and mathematics made significant indian early medieval age  600  ce to 1200  ce  is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural when harsha of kannauj  who ruled much of the indo-gangetic  plain from 606  to 647  ce  attempted to expand southwards  he was defeated by the chalukya ruler of the when his successor attempted to expand eastwards  he was defeated by the pala king of when the chalukyas attempted to expand southwards  they were defeated by the pallavas from farther south  who in turn were opposed by the pandyas and the cholas from still farther no ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core during this time  pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society  as were new non-traditional  ruling the caste system consequently began to show regional the 6th  and 7th  centuries  the first devotional hymns were created in the tamil they were imitated all over india and led to both the resurgence of hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the indian royalty  big and small  and the temples they patronised  drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities  which became economic hubs as temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as india underwent another by the 8th  and 9th  centuries  the effects were felt in south-east  asia  as south indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day  myanmar  thailand  laos  cambodia  vietnam  philippines  malaysia  and indian merchants  scholars  and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission  south-east  asians took the initiative as well  with many sojourning in indian seminaries and translating buddhist and hindu texts into their the 10th  century  muslim central asian nomadic clans  using swift-horse  cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion  repeatedly overran south asia s north-western  plains  leading eventually to the establishment of the islamic delhi sultanate in the sultanate was to control much of north india  and to make many forays into south india  although at first disruptive for the indian elites  the sultanate largely left its vast non-muslim  subject population to its own laws and by repeatedly repulsing mongol raiders in the 13th  century  the sultanate saved india from the devastation visited on west and central asia  setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers  learned men  mystics  traders  artists  and artisans from that region into the subcontinent  thereby creating a syncretic indo-islamic  culture in the the sultanate s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of south india paved the way for the indigenous vijayanagara embracing a strong shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate  the empire came to control much of peninsular and was to influence south indian society for long the early 16th  century  northern india  being then under mainly muslim fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of central asian the resulting mughal empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule  but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative and diverse and inclusive ruling leading to more systematic  centralised  and uniform eschewing tribal bonds and islamic identity  especially under akbar  the mughals united their far-flung  realms through loyalty  expressed through a persianised culture  to an emperor who had near-divine  the mughal state s economic policies  deriving most revenues from and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated  silver caused peasants and artisans to enter larger the relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th  century was a factor in india s economic resulting in greater patronage of painting  literary forms  textiles  and newly coherent social groups in northern and western india  such as the marathas  the rajputs  and the sikhs  gained military and governing ambitions during mughal rule  which  through collaboration or adversity  gave them both recognition and military expanding commerce during mughal rule gave rise to new indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern as the empire disintegrated  many among these elites were able to seek and control their own the early 18th  century  with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred  a number of european trading companies  including the english east india company  had established coastal the east india company s control of the seas  greater resources  and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the indian elite  these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the bengal region by 1765  and sideline the other european its further access to the riches of bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of india by the india was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had  but was instead supplying the british empire with raw materials  and many historians consider this to be the onset of india s colonial by this time  with its economic power severely curtailed by the british parliament and effectively having been made an arm of british administration  the company began to more consciously enter non-economic  arenas such as education  social reform  and consider india s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848  and 1885.  the appointment in 1848  of lord dalhousie as governor general of the east india company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state  these included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty  the surveillance of the population  and the education of citizens  technological changes—among them  railways  canals  and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in however  disaffection with the company also grew during this time  and set off the indian rebellion of 1857.  fed by diverse resentments and perceptions  including invasive british-style  social reforms  harsh land taxes  and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes  the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central india and shook the foundations of company although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858,  it led to the dissolution of the east india company and to the direct administration of india by the british government  proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited british-style  parliamentary system  the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future in the decades following  public life gradually emerged all over india  leading eventually to the founding of the indian national congress in rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th  century was marked by economic setbacks—many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away  there was an increase in the number of large-scale  and  despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by indian taxpayers  little industrial employment was generated for there were also salutary effects  commercial cropping  especially in the newly canalled punjab  led to increased food production for internal the railway network provided critical famine notably reduced the cost of moving and helped nascent indian-owned  world war i  in which approximately one million indians a new period began  it was marked by british reforms but also repressive legislations  by more strident indian calls for self-rule,  and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation,  of which mohandas karamchand gandhi would become the leader and enduring during the 1930s,  slow legislative reform was enacted by the british  the indian national congress won victories in the resulting the next decade was beset with crises  indian participation in world war ii  the congress s final push for non-co-operation,  and an upsurge of muslim nationalism  all were capped by the advent of independence in 1947,  but tempered by the partition of india into two states  india and to india s self-image  as an independent nation was its constitution  completed in 1950,  which put in place a secular and democratic it has remained a democracy with civil liberties  an active supreme court  and a largely independent economic liberalisation  which was begun in the 1990s,  has created a large urban middle class  transformed india into one of the world s
