 in meteorology  training denotes repeated areas of rain  typically associated with thunderstorms  that move over the same region in a relatively short period of time  training thunderstorms are capable of producing excessive rainfall totals  often causing flash the name training is derived from how a train and its cars travel along a track  moving along a single path   without the track and thunderstorms along thunderstorm trains usually develop in one area of stationary instability  and are advanced along a single path by prevailing winds  additional showers and storms can also develop when the gust front from a storm collides with warmer air outside of the storm  the same process repeats in the new storms  until overall conditions in the surrounding atmosphere become too stable for support of thunderstorm activity  showers and storms can also develop along stationary fronts  and winds move them down the front  the showers that often accompany thunderstorms are usually thunderstorms that are not completely developed a series of storms continually moving over the same area  dumping heavy rains  can cause flash each storm usually produces heavy rain  and after a significant amount of rain falls from the storms which have moved over the same area  flooding occurs thunderstorm training is used to refer specifically to training occurring with thunderstorms  it forms when storms tend to backbuild  this type of training can quickly cause flash flooding  especially if the thunderstorms are strong
