 tropical storm zeta was a very late-developing  tropical storm over the central atlantic that formed after the 2005  atlantic hurricane season had officially ended  on november 30)  and continued into january 2006.  becoming a tropical depression at approximately midnight on december 30  it became the record-breaking  thirtieth tropical cyclone of the 2005  atlantic hurricane season and after intensifying into tropical storm zeta six hours later  it became the season s twenty-seventh  named storm  zeta was one of only two atlantic tropical cyclones to span two calendar years  the other being hurricane alice in 1954â€“55).zeta  originated from an area of low pressure on december 29,  which previously developed within an upper-level  trough  after becoming a tropical storm  the national hurricane center continually predicted it would weaken rapidly  like the previous tropical cyclone  hurricane epsilon  zeta defied these predictions  the storm reached its peak strength on january 2,  2006  before finally dissipating on january 6.  as zeta never approached land there was no impact from the storm other than minor shipping problems  several ships encountered the storm  and several crews in the 2005  atlantic rowing race were affected by rough seas and high winds tropical storm zeta originated from an upper-level  trough that interacted with a weakening frontal system in late-december  2005.  by december 28,  the trough had developed into a low pressure area roughly 750  mi (1,210  km  west-northwest  of the cape verde islands  the following day  a low-level  circulation developed and convective activity began to increase around the low  by december 30,  sufficient shower and thunderstorm activity had developed for the national hurricane center  nhc  to classify it as a tropical cyclone  over the following several hours  convective banding developed around the storm s center and by 0600  utc  the depression intensified into tropical storm zeta  the record 28th  tropical or subtropical cyclone to form during the 2005  atlantic hurricane operationally  however  the nhc did not begin issuing advisories on zeta until 1700  traveling slowly northwestward in response to a mid-level  low to the southwest  the storm gradually intensified in a region of favorable anticyclonic the afternoon of december 30,  dry air caused the system to become slightly disorganized and led forecasters to anticipate further weakening of the storm and dissipating within three the following day  a mid-level  ridge to the north caused zeta turn westward before nearly stalling due to upper-level  westerlies  by this time  the storm attained winds of 60  mph (95  km h  but increasing wind shear caused convection to become disorganized  resulting in a brief weakening period  despite the shear  the shallow structure of zeta allowed convection to regenerate and the storm gradually re-intensified.  around 1800  utc on january 1,  2006,  zeta attained its peak intensity with winds of 65  mph (100  km h  and a barometric pressure of 994  mbar  hpa  29.35  inhg  roughly 1,035  mi (1,665  km  northwest of the cape verde by january 2,  the storm began tracking towards the southwest in response to a mid-level  trough located east of the tropical storm zeta continued to defy forecasts of effects of wind shear finally took their toll late on january 4,  and zeta s convection began to die down  this led to tropical storm zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm  the nhc continued to overestimate how quickly zeta would dissipate and early on january 5  they operationally downgraded zeta to a depression  which was later confirmed to have been an zeta continued to move west-northwestward,  barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again  zeta weakened into a tropical depression on january 6  and dissipated into a remnant later that day  with this transition  the very active 2005  hurricane season finally came to a close  the remnant low retained its identity for a further day before it dissipated 660  miles (1060  km  southeast of of the crews that were taking part in the 2005  atlantic rowing race were affected with heavy seas and strong adverse winds from tropical storm several teams encountered winds up to 50  mph (85  km h  and large swells up to 12  ft (3.7  although battered by torrential rain and high winds  the direction of the winds assisted some of the ships in the race by speeding them closer to one welsh vessel was blown 25  mi (40  km  off-course,  ending with an encounter with a 12  ft (3.7  m  shark that battered their the ship liberty star made several reports of strong winds from tropical storm zeta  including one of 40  mph (65  km h  winds early on december 31,  when the ship was about 45  miles (75  km  north of the zeta formed at 0600  utc on december 30,  it became the second latest-forming  tropical cyclone ever recorded in the only hurricane alice of december 1954  formed later than zeta  becoming a tropical storm around 1200  utc  additionally  zeta became the second known atlantic tropical cyclone  along with alice  to exist in two calendar tropical storm zeta also extended the record number of storms to form in the 2005  season to twenty-eight,  seven more than the previous record held by the 1933  also  if an unnamed subtropical storm had been named  the storm would have been named  eta  accordingly although the storm affected several vessels during its existence  no land areas were threatened by zeta  as a result  the nhc did not issue any tropical storm watches or
