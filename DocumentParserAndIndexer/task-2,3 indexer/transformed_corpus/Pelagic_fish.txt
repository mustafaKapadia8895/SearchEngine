 pelagic fish live in the pelagic zone of ocean or lake waters – being neither close to the bottom nor near the shore – in contrast with demersal fish  which do live on or near the bottom  and reef fish  which are associated with coral marine pelagic environment is the largest aquatic habitat on earth  occupying 1,370  million cubic kilometres (330  million cubic miles   and is the habitat for 11%  of known fish species  the oceans have a mean depth of 4000  metres  about 98%  of the total water volume is below 100  metres (330  ft   and 75%  is below 1,000  metres (3,300  pelagic fish can be divided into pelagic coastal fish and oceanic pelagic coastal fish inhabit the relatively shallow and sunlit waters above the continental shelf  while oceanic fish  which may well also swim inshore  inhabit the vast and deep waters beyond the continental fish range in size from small coastal forage fish  such as herrings and sardines  to large apex predator oceanic fishes  such as bluefin tuna and oceanic they are usually agile swimmers with streamlined bodies  capable of sustained cruising on long-distance  migrations  the indo-pacific  sailfish  an oceanic pelagic fish  can sprint at over 110  kilometres per hour  some tuna species cruise across the pacific ocean  many pelagic fish swim in schools weighing hundreds of tonnes  others are solitary  like the large ocean sunfish weighing over 500  kilograms  which sometimes drift passively with ocean currents  eating fish inhabit the epipelagic zone  the epipelagic zone is the water from the surface of the sea down to 200  metres  it is also referred to as the surface waters or the sunlit zone  and includes the photic zone  the photic zone is defined as the surface waters down to the point where the sunlight has attenuated to 1%  of the surface value  this depth depends on how turbid the water is  but in clear water can extend to 200  metres  coinciding with the epipelagic zone  the photic zone has sufficient light for phytoplankton to epipelagic zone is vast  and is the home for most pelagic fish  the zone is well lit so visual predators can use their eyesight  is usually well mixed and oxygenated from wave action  and can be a good habitat for algae to grow  however  it is an almost featureless habitat  this lack of habitat diversity results in a lack of species diversity  so the zone supports less than 2%  of the world s known fish species  much of the zone lacks nutrients for supporting fish  so epipelagic fish tend to be found in coastal water above the continental shelves  where land runoff can provide nutrients  or in those parts of the ocean where upwelling moves nutrients into the fish can be broadly divided into small forage fish and larger predator fish which feed on them  forage fish school and filter feed on plankton  most epipelagic fish have streamlined bodies capable of sustained cruising on migrations  in general  predatory and forage fish share the same morphological features  predator fish are usually fusiform with large mouths  smooth bodies  and deeply forked tails  many use vision to predate zooplankton or smaller fish  while others filter feed on plankton most epipelagic predator fish and their smaller prey fish are countershaded with silvery colours which reduce visibility by scattering incoming the silvering is achieved with reflective fish scales that function as small mirrors  this can give an effect of transparency  at medium depths at sea  light comes from above  so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the the shallower epipelagic waters  the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths  and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings  a further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section  is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin  as they would fail to reflect horizontally  the overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors  all oriented the number of species is limited  epipelagic fishes are abundant  what they lack in diversity they make up in numbers  forage fish occur in huge numbers  and large fish that prey on them are often sought after as premier food fish  as a group  epipelagic fishes form the most valuable fisheries in the forage fish are facultative predators that can pick individual copepods or fish larvae out of the water column  and then change to filter feeding on phytoplankton when energetically that gives better results  filter feeding fish usually use long fine gill rakers to strain small organisms from the water column  some of the largest epipelagic fishes  such as the basking shark and whale shark are filter feeders  and so are some of the smallest  such as adult sprats and waters that are exceptionally clear contain little food  areas of high productivity tend to be somewhat turbid from plankton blooms  these attract the filter feeding plankton eaters  which in turn attract the higher predators  tuna fishing tends to be optimum when water turbidity  measured by the maximum depth a secchi disc can be seen during a sunny day  is 15  to 35  fish are fascinated with floating objects  they aggregate in considerable numbers around objects such as drifting flotsam  rafts  jellyfish and floating seaweed  the objects appear to provide a  visual stimulus in an optical floating objects can offer some protection for juvenile fish from predators  an abundance of drifting seaweed or jellyfish can result in significant increases in the survival rates of some juvenile coastal juveniles use seaweed for the shelter and the food that is available from invertebrates and other fish associated with it  drifting seaweed  particularly the pelagic sargassum  provide a niche habitat with its own shelter and food  and even supports its own unique fauna  such as the sargassum one study  off florida  found 54  species from 23  families living in flotsam from sargassum jellyfish are also used by juvenile fish for shelter and food  even though jellyfish may prey on small oceanic species such as tuna can be captured by travelling long distances in large fishing vessels  a simpler alternative is to leverage off the fascination fish have with floating objects  when fishermen use such objects  they are called fish aggregating devices  fads   fads are anchored rafts or objects of any type  floating on the surface or just below it  fishermen in the pacific and indian oceans set up floating fads  assembled from all sorts of debris  around tropical islands  and then use purse seines to capture the fish attracted to study using sonar in french polynesia  found large shoals of juvenile bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna aggregated closest to the devices  10  to 50  m  further out  50  to 150  m  was a less dense group of larger yellowfin and albacore tuna  yet further out  to 500  m  was a dispersed group of various large adult tuna  the distribution and density of these groups was variable and overlapped  the fads were also used by other fish  and the aggregations dispersed when it was fish  even predator fish such as the great barracuda in the photo on the left  often attract a retinue of small fish that accompany them in a strategically safe way  skindivers who remain for long periods in the water  also often attract a retinue of fish  with smaller fishes coming in close  and larger fishes observing from a greater distance  marine turtles  functioning as a mobile shelter for small fish  can be impaled accidentally by a swordfish trying to catch the fish  also called neritic or inshore fish  inhabit the waters near the coast and above the continental shelf  since the continental shelf is usually less than 200  metres deep  it follows that coastal fish that are not demersal fish are usually epipelagic fish  inhabiting the sunlit epipelagic epipelagic fish are among the most abundant in the world  they include forage fish as well as the predator fish that feed on them  forage fish thrive in those inshore waters where high productivity results from the upwelling and shoreline run off of nutrients  some are partial residents that spawn in streams  estuaries and bays  but most complete their life cycle in the fish  also called open ocean or offshore fish  live in the waters that are not above the continental shelf  oceanic fish can be contrasted with coastal fish  who do live above the continental shelf  however  the two types are not mutually exclusive  since there are no firm boundaries between coastal and ocean regions  and many epipelagic fish move between coastal and oceanic waters  particularly in different stages in their life epipelagic fish can be true residents  partial residents  or accidental residents  true residents live their entire life in the open ocean  only a few species are true residents  such as tuna  billfish  flying fish  sauries  pilotfish and remoras  dolphin  ocean sharks and ocean sunfish  most of these species migrate back and forth across open oceans  rarely venturing over continental shelves  some true residents associate with drifting jellyfish or residents occur in three groups  species which live in the zone only when they are juveniles  drifting with jellyfish and seaweeds   species which live in the zone only when they are adults  salmon  flying fish  dolphin and whale sharks   and deep water species which make nightly migrations up into the surface waters  such as the accidental residents occur occasionally when adults and juveniles of species from other environments are carried by accident into the zone by huge ocean sunfish  a true resident of the ocean epipelagic zone  sometimes drifts with the current  eating jellyfishthe giant whale shark  another resident of the ocean epipelagic zone  filter feeds on plankton  and periodically dives deep into the mesopelagic zone lanternfish are partial residents of the ocean epipelagic zone  during the day they hide in deep waters  but at night they migrate up to surface waters to feed in the deep ocean  the waters extend far below the epipelagic zone  and support very different types of pelagic fishes adapted to living in these deeper deep water  marine snow is a continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from the upper layers of the water column  its origin lies in activities within the productive photic zone  marine snow includes dead or dying plankton  protists  diatoms   fecal matter  sand  soot and other inorganic dust  the  snowflakes  grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter  travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor  however  most organic components of marine snow are consumed by microbes  zooplankton and other filter-feeding  animals within the first 1,000  metres of their journey  that is  within the epipelagic zone  in this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea  mesopelagic and benthic ecosystems  as sunlight cannot reach them  deep-sea  organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source some deep-sea  pelagic groups  such as the lanternfish  ridgehead  marine hatchetfish  and lightfish families are sometimes termed pseudoceanic because  rather than having an even distribution in open water  they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases  notably seamounts and over continental slopes  the phenomenon is explained by the likewise abundance of prey species which are also attracted to the structures the fish in the different pelagic and deep water benthic zones are physically structured  and behave in ways  that differ markedly from each other  groups of coexisting species within each zone all seem to operate in similar ways  such as the small mesopelagic vertically migrating plankton-feeders,  the bathypelagic anglerfishes  and the deep water benthic rattails  finned species  with spiny fins  are rare among deep sea fishes  which suggests that deep sea fish are ancient and so well adapted to their environment that invasions by more modern fishes have been the few ray fins that do exist are mainly in the beryciformes and lampriformes  which are also ancient forms  most deep sea pelagic fishes belong to their own orders  suggesting a long evolution in deep sea environments  in contrast  deep water benthic species  are in orders that include many related shallow water the epipelagic zone  conditions change rapidly  between 200  metres and about 1000  metres  light continues to fade until there is almost none  temperatures fall through a thermocline to temperatures between 4  °c (39  °f  and 8  °c (46  °f   this is the twilight or mesopelagic zone  pressure continues to increase  at the rate of one atmosphere every 10  metres  while nutrient concentrations fall  along with dissolved oxygen and the rate at which the water operators  using the newly developed sonar technology during world war ii  were puzzled by what appeared to be a false sea floor 300–500  metres deep at day  and less deep at night  this turned out to be due to millions of marine organisms  most particularly small mesopelagic fish  with swimbladders that reflected the sonar  these organisms migrate up into shallower water at dusk to feed on plankton  the layer is deeper when the moon is out  and can become shallower when clouds pass over the moon  this phenomenon has come to be known as the deep scattering mesopelagic fish make daily vertical migrations  moving at night into the epipelagic zone  often following similar migrations of zooplankton  and returning to the depths for safety during the these vertical migrations often occur over a large vertical distances  and are undertaken with the assistance of a swimbladder  the swimbladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up  and  given the high pressures in the messoplegic zone  this requires significant energy  as the fish ascends  the pressure in the swimbladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting  when the fish wants to return to the depths  the swimbladder is some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the thermocline  where the temperature changes between 10  and 20  °c  thus displaying considerable tolerances for temperature fish have muscular bodies  ossified bones  scales  well developed gills and central nervous systems  and large hearts and kidneys  mesopelagic plankton feeders have small mouths with fine gill rakers  while the piscivores have larger mouths and coarser gill the vertically migratory fish have fish are adapted for an active life under low light conditions  most of them are visual predators with large eyes  some of the deeper water fish have tubular eyes with big lenses and only rod cells that look upwards  these give binocular vision and great sensitivity to small light this adaptation gives improved terminal vision at the expense of lateral vision  and allows the predator to pick out squid  cuttlefish  and smaller fish that are silhouetted against the gloom above them mesopelagic fish usually lack defensive spines  and use colour to camouflage them from other fish  ambush predators are dark  black or red  since the longer  red  wavelengths of light do not reach the deep sea  red effectively functions the same as black  migratory forms use countershaded silvery colours  on their bellies  they often display photophores producing low grade light  for a predator from below  looking upwards  this bioluminescence camouflages the silhouette of the fish  however  some of these predators have yellow lenses that filter the  red deficient  ambient light  leaving the bioluminescence antarctic toothfish have large  upward looking eyes  adapted to detecting the silhouettes of prey barreleye has barrel-shaped,  tubular eyes which are generally directed upwards but can be swivelled stoplight loosejaw has a lower jaw one-quarter  as long as its body  the jaw has no floor and is attached only by a hinge and a modified tongue bone  large fang-like  teeth in the front are followed by many small barbed stoplight loosejaw is also one of the few fishes that produce red bioluminescence  as most of their prey cannot perceive red light  this allows it to hunt with an essentially invisible beam of brownsnout spookfish is a species of barreleye is the only vertebrate known to employ a mirror  as opposed to a lens  to focus an image in its via deep trawling indicates that lanternfish account for as much as 65%  of all deep sea fish indeed  lanternfish are among the most widely distributed  populous  and diverse of all vertebrates  playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms  the estimated global biomass of lanternfish is 550–660  million metric tonnes  several times the entire world fisheries catch  lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world s oceans  sonar reflects off the millions of lanternfish swim bladders  giving the appearance of a false tuna are an epipelagic mesopelagic species that eats other fish  satellite tagging has shown that bigeye tuna often spend prolonged periods cruising deep below the surface during the daytime  sometimes making dives as deep as 500  metres  these movements are thought to be in response to the vertical migrations of prey organisms in the deep scattering layer longnose lancetfish  lancetfish are ambush predators which spend all their time in the mesopelagic zone  they are among the largest mesopelagic fishes  up to 2  telescopefish has large  forward-pointing  telescoping eyes with large daggertooth paralyses other mesopelagic fish when it bites them with its dagger-like  tuna cruise the epipelagic zone at night and the mesopelagic zone during the day below the mesopelagic zone it is pitch dark  this is the midnight or bathypelagic zone  extending from 1000  m to the bottom deep water benthic zone  if the water is exceptionally deep  the pelagic zone below 4000  m is sometimes called the lower midnight or abyssopelagic zone conditions are somewhat uniform throughout these zones  the darkness is complete  the pressure is crushing  and temperatures  nutrients and dissolved oxygen levels are all fish have special adaptations to cope with these conditions – they have slow metabolisms and unspecialized diets  being willing to eat anything that comes along  they prefer to sit and wait for food rather than waste energy searching for it  the behaviour of bathypelagic fish can be contrasted with the behaviour of mesopelagic fish  mesopelagic are often highly mobile  whereas bathypelagic fish are almost all lie-in-wait  predators  normally expending little energy in dominant bathypelagic fishes are small bristlemouth and anglerfish  fangtooth  viperfish  daggertooth and barracudina are also common  these fishes are small  many about 10  centimetres long  and not many longer than 25  cm  they spend most of their time waiting patiently in the water column for prey to appear or to be lured by their phosphors  what little energy is available in the bathypelagic zone filters from above in the form of detritus  faecal material  and the occasional invertebrate or mesopelagic about 20%  of the food that has its origins in the epipelagic zone falls down to the mesopelagic but only about 5%  filters down to the bathypelagic fish are sedentary  adapted to outputting minimum energy in a habitat with very little food or available energy  not even sunlight  only bioluminescence  their bodies are elongated with weak  watery muscles and skeletal structures  since so much of the fish is water  they are not compressed by the great pressures at these depths  they often have extensible  hinged jaws with recurved teeth  they are slimy  without scales  the central nervous system is confined to the lateral line and olfactory systems  the eyes are small and may not function  and gills  kidneys and hearts  and swimbladders are small or are the same features found in fish larvae  which suggests that during their evolution  bathypelagic fish have acquired these features through neoteny  as with larvae  these features allow the fish to remain suspended in the water with little expenditure of their ferocious appearance  these beasts of the deep are mostly miniature fish with weak muscles  and are too small to represent any threat to humans the swimbladders of deep sea fish are either absent or scarcely operational  and bathypelagic fish do not normally undertake vertical migrations  filling bladders at such great pressures incurs huge energy costs  some deep sea fishes have swimbladders which function while they are young and inhabit the upper epipelagic zone  but they wither or fill with fat when the fish move down to their adult most important sensory systems are usually the inner ear  which responds to sound  and the lateral line  which responds to changes in water pressure  the olfactory system can also be important for males who find females by bathypelagic fish are black  or sometimes red  with few photophores  when photophores are used  it is usually to entice prey or attract a mate  because food is so scarce  bathypelagic predators are not selective in their feeding habits  but grab whatever come close enough  they accomplish this by having a large mouth with sharp teeth for grabbing large prey and overlapping gill rakers which prevent small prey that have been swallowed from is not easy finding a mate in this zone  some species depend on bioluminescence  others are hermaphrodites  which doubles their chances of producing both eggs and sperm when an encounter the female anglerfish releases pheromones to attract tiny males  when a male finds her  he bites on to her and never lets go  when a male of the anglerfish species haplophryne mollis bites into the skin of a female  he release an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body  fusing the pair to the point where the two circulatory systems join up  the male then atrophies into nothing more than a pair of gonads  this extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that  when the female is ready to spawn  she has a mate immediately forms other than fish live in the bathypelagic zone  such as squid  large whales  octopuses  sponges  brachiopods  sea stars  and echinoids  but this zone is difficult for fish to live in the gulper eel uses its mouth like a net by opening its large mouth and swimming at its prey  it has a luminescent organ at the tip of its tail to attract prey the black swallower  with its distensible stomach  is notable for its ability to swallow  whole  bony fishes ten times its haplophryne mollis anglerfish trailing attached males which have atrophied into a pair of gonads  for use when the female is ready to spawn the widespread fangtooth has the largest teeth of any fish  proportionate to body despite their ferocious appearance  bathypelagic fish are usually weakly muscled and too small to represent any threat to humans the sloane s viperfish can make nightly migrations from bathypelagic depths to near surface fish live on or near the bottom of the demersal fish are found by the seafloor in coastal areas on the continental shelf  and in the open ocean they are found along the outer continental margin on the continental slope and the continental rise  they are not generally found at abyssopelagic or hadopelagic depths or on the abyssal plain  they occupy a range of seafloors consisting of mud  sand  gravel or deep waters  the fishes of the demersal zone are active and relatively abundant  compared to fishes of the bathypelagic and brotulas are common  and other well-established  families are eels  eelpouts  hagfishes  greeneyes  batfishes and bodies of deep water benthic fishes are muscular with well developed organs  in this way they are closer to mesopelagic fishes than bathopelagic fishes  in other ways  they are more variable  photophores are usually absent  eyes and swimbladders range from absent to well developed  they vary in size  with larger species greater than one metre not uncommon deep sea benthic fish are usually long and narrow  many are eels or shaped like eels  this may be because long bodies have long lateral lines  lateral lines detect low-frequency  sounds  and some benthic fishes appear to have muscles that drum such sounds to attract smell is also important  as indicated by the rapidity with which benthic fish find traps baited with bait fish the main diet of deep sea benthic fish is invertebrates of the deep sea benthos and carrion  smell  touch and lateral line sensitivities seem to be the main sensory devices for locating sea benthic fish can be divided into strictly benthic fish and benthopelagic fish  usually  strictly benthic fish are negatively buoyant  while benthopelagic fish are neutrally buoyant  strictly benthic fish stay in constant contact with the bottom  they either lie-and-wait  as ambush predators or move actively over the bottom in search for fish inhabit the water just above the bottom  feeding on benthos and benthopelagic most dermersal fish are can be divided into flabby or robust body types  flabby benthopelagic fishes are like bathopelagic fishes  they have a reduced body mass  and low metabolic rates  expending minimal energy as they lie and wait to ambush an example of a flabby fish is the cusk-eel  acanthonus a predator with a huge head and a body that is 90%  water  this fish has the largest ears  otoliths  and the smallest brain in relation to its body size of all known benthopelagic fish are muscular swimmers that actively cruise the bottom searching for prey  they may live around features  such as seamounts  which have strong examples are the orange roughy and patagonian toothfish  because these fish were once abundant  and because their robust bodies are good to eat  these fish have been commercially fish are not pelagic fish  but they are discussed here briefly  by way of completeness and contrast some fishes don t fit into the above classification  for example  the family of nearly blind spiderfishes  common and widely distributed  feed on benthopelagic zooplankton  yet they are strictly benthic fish  since they stay in contact with the bottom  their fins have long rays they use to  stand  on the bottom while they face the current and grab zooplankton as it passes deepest-living  fish known  the strictly benthic abyssobrotula galatheae  eel-like  and blind  feeds on benthic hagfish resting on bottom  hagfish coat themselves and any dead fish they find with noxious slime making them inedible to other species  the tripodfish  bathypterois grallator   a species of spiderfish  uses its fin extensions to  stand  on the blotched fantail ray feeds on bottom-dwelling  fish  bivalves  crabs and great depths  food scarcity and extreme pressure works to limit the survivability fish  the deepest point of the ocean is about 11,000  metres  bathypelagic fishes are not normally found below 3,000  metres  the greatest depth recorded for a benthic fish is 8,370  it may be that extreme pressures interfere with essential enzyme fishes are likely to be found  and are more diverse  on the continental slope  where there is habitat diversity and often food supplies  about 40%  of the ocean floor consists of abyssal plains  but these flat  featureless regions are covered with sediment and largely devoid of benthic life  benthos   deep sea benthic fishes are more likely to associate with canyons or rock outcroppings among the plains  where invertebrate communities are established  undersea mountains  seamounts  can intercept deep sea currents  and cause productive upwellings which support benthic fish  undersea mountain ranges can separate underwater regions into different billfish shark herring sardineanchovymenhadencod flatfish small pelagic fish are usually forage fish that are hunted by larger pelagic fish and other predators  forage fish filter feed on plankton and are usually less than 10  centimetres long  they often stay together in schools and may migrate large distances between spawning grounds and feeding grounds  they are found particularly in upwelling regions around the northeast atlantic  off the coast of japan  and off the west coasts of africa and the americas  forage fish are generally short-lived,  and their stocks fluctuate markedly over the years  are found in the north sea and the north atlantic at depths to 200  meters  important herring fisheries have existed in these areas for centuries  herring of different sizes and growth rates belong to different populations  each of which have their own migration routes  when spawning  a female produces from 20,000  to 50,000  eggs  after spawning  the herrings are depleted in fat  and migrate back to feeding grounds rich in around iceland  three separate populations of herring were traditionally fished  these stocks collapsed in the late 1960s,  although two have since recovered  after the collapse  iceland turned to capelin  which now account for about half of iceland s total whiting are found in the open ocean and above the continental slope at depths between 100  and 1000  meters  they follow vertical migrations of the zooplankton they feed on to the bottom during daytime and to the surface at night fisheries for anchovies and sardines have also operated in the pacific  the mediterranean  and the southeast the world annual catch of forage fish in recent years has been around 22  million tonnes  or one quarter of the world s total catch these schooling pacific sardines are forage fishherrings ram feeding on copepods capelinanchoviesperuvian anchovetamedium size pelagic fishes include trevally  barracuda  flying fish  bonito  mahi mahi and coastal many of these fish hunt forage fish  but are in turn hunted by yet larger pelagic fish  nearly all fish are predator fish to some measure  and apart from the top predators  the distinction between predator fish and prey or forage fish is somewhat europe there are three populations of coastal mackerel  one population migrates to the north sea  another stays in of the irish sea  and the third population migrates southwards along the west coast of scotland and ireland  the mackerel s cruise speed is an impressive 10  kilometres per large pelagic fish are oceanic nomadic species which undertake long offshore migrations  they feed on small pelagic forage fish  as well as medium-sized  pelagic fish  at times  they follow their schooling prey  and many species form schools themselves examples of larger pelagic fish are tuna  billfish  king mackerel and sharks and large rays tuna in particular are of major importance to commercial fisheries  though tuna migrate across oceans  trying to find them there is not the usual approach  tuna tend to congregate in areas where food is abundant  along the boundaries of currents  around islands  near seamounts  and in some areas of upwelling along continental slopes  tuna are captured by several methods  purse seine vessels enclose an entire surface school with special nets  pole and line vessels which use poles baited with other smaller pelagic fish as baitfish  and rafts called fish aggregating devices are set up  because tuna  as well as some other pelagic fish  tend to congregate under floating large pelagic fish are premier game fish  particularly marlin and swordfish yellowfin tuna are being fished as a replacement for the now largely depleted southern bluefin tuna atlantic pomfretswordfishking mackerels cruise on long migrations at 10  kilometres per occurs both along coastlines and in midocean when a collision of deep ocean currents brings cold water rich in nutrients to the surface  these upwellings support blooms of phytoplankton  which in turn produce zooplankton and support many of the world s main fisheries  if the upwelling fails then fisheries in the area the 1960s  the peruvian anchoveta fishery was the world s largest fishery  the anchoveta population was greatly reduced during the 1972  el niño event  when warm water drifted over the cold humboldt current  as part of a 50-year  cycle  lowering the depth of the thermocline  the upwelling stopped and phytoplankton production plummeted  as did the anchoveta population  and millions of seabirds  dependent on the anchoveta  since the mid-1980s,  the upwelling has resumed  and the peruvian anchoveta catch levels have returned to the 1960s  levels off japan  the collision of the oyashio current with the kuroshio current produces nutrient-rich  upwellings  cyclic changes in these currents resulted in a decline in the sardine sardinops melanosticta populations  fisheries catches fell from 5  million tonnes in 1988  to 280  thousand tonnes in 1998.  as a further consequence  pacific bluefin tuna stopped moving into the region to currents can shape how fish are distributed  both concentrating and dispersing them  adjacent ocean currents can define distinct  if shifting  boundaries  these boundaries can even be visible  but usually their presence is marked by rapid changes in salinity  temperature and example  in the asian northern pacific  albacore are confined between two current systems  the northern boundary is determined by the cold north pacific current and the southern boundary is determined by the north equatorial current  to complicate things  their distribution is further modified within the area defined by the two current systems by another current  the kuroshio current  whose flows fluctuate fish often spawn in an area where the eggs and larvae drift downstream into suitable feeding areas  and eventually drift into adult feeding and banks can interact with currents and upwellings in a manner that results in areas of high ocean productivity  large eddies can form downcurrent or downwind from islands  concentrating banks and reefs can intercept deep currents that fish generally move long distances between feeding and spawning areas  or as a response to changes in the ocean  large ocean predators  such as salmon and tuna  can migrate thousands of kilometres  crossing a 2001  study  the movements of atlantic bluefin tuna from an area off north carolina were studied with the help of special popup tags  when attached to a tuna  these tags monitored the movements of the tuna for about a year  then freed themselves  and floated to the surface where they transmitted their information to a satellite  the study found that the tuna had four different migration patterns  one group confined itself to the western atlantic for a year  another group also stayed mainly in the western atlantic  but migrated to the gulf of mexico for spawning  a third group moved across the atlantic ocean and back again  the fourth group crossed to the eastern atlantic and then moved into the mediterranean sea for spawning  the study indicates that  while there is some differentiation by spawning areas  there is essentially only one population of atlantic bluefin tuna  intermixing groups that between them use all of the north atlantic ocean  the gulf of mexico and the mediterranean term highly migratory species  hms  is a legal term which has its origins in article 64  of the united nations convention on the law of the sea highly migratory species include  tuna and tuna-like  species  albacore  atlantic bluefin  bigeye tuna  skipjack  yellowfin  blackfin  little tunny  pacific bluefin  southern bluefin and bullet   pomfret  marlin  sailfish  swordfish  saury and oceangoing sharks  dolphins and other cetaceans essentially  highly migratory species coincide with the larger of the  large pelagic fish   discussed in the previous section  if cetaceans are added and some commercially unimportant fish  such as the sunfish  are excluded  these are high trophic level species which undertake migrations of significant but variable distances across oceans for feeding  often on forage fish  or reproduction  and also have wide geographic distributions  thus  these species are found both inside the 200-nautical-mile  (370  km  exclusive economic zones and in the high seas outside these zones  they are pelagic species  which means they mostly live in the open ocean and do not live near the sea floor  although they may spend part of their life cycle in nearshore to the food and agriculture organization  fao   the world harvest in 2005  consisted of 93.2  million tonnes captured by commercial fishing in wild of this total  about 45%  were pelagic fish  the following table shows the world capture production
