 the baltic sea is a sea of the atlantic ocean  enclosed by scandinavia  finland  the baltic countries  and the north and central european plain the sea stretches from 53°n  to 66°n  latitude and from 10°e  to 30°e  longitude  a mediterranean sea of the atlantic  with limited water exchange between the two bodies  the baltic sea drains through the danish islands into the kattegat by way of the straits of øresund  the great belt  and the little belt  it includes the gulf of bothnia  the bay of bothnia  the gulf of finland  the gulf of riga  and the bay of gdańsk the baltic proper is bordered on its northern edge  at the latitude 60°n,  by the åland islands and the gulf of bothnia  on its northeastern edge by the gulf of finland  on its eastern edge by the gulf of riga  and in the west by the swedish part of the southern scandinavian peninsula the baltic sea is connected by artificial waterways to the white sea via the white sea canal and to the german bight of the north sea via the kiel canal administrationthe helsinki convention on the protection of the marine environment of the baltic sea area includes the baltic sea and the kattegat  without calling kattegat a part of the baltic sea   for the purposes of this convention the  baltic sea area  shall be the baltic sea and the entrance to the baltic sea  bounded by the parallel of the skaw in the skagerrak at historyhistorically  the kingdom of denmark collected sound dues from ships at the border between the ocean and the land-locked  baltic sea  they were collected in the øresund at kronborg castle near helsingør  in the great belt at nyborg  in the little belt  the site of intake was moved to fredericia  after that stronghold had been built  the narrowest part of little belt is the  middelfart sund  near widely agree that the preferred physical border of the baltic is a line drawn through the southern danish islands  drogden-sill  and the drogden sill is situated north of køge bugt and connects dragør in the south of copenhagen to malmö  it is used by the øresund bridge  including the drogden tunnel  by this definition  the danish straits are part of the entrance  but the bay of mecklenburg and the bay of kiel are parts of the baltic sea  another usual border is the line between falsterbo  sweden and stevns klint  denmark  as this is the southern border of øresund  it s also the border between the shallow southern øresund  with a typical depth of 5–10  meters only  and notably deeper water hydrography and biologydrogden sill  depth of 7  m (23  ft   sets a limit to øresund and darss sill  depth of 18  m (59  ft    and a limit to the belt the shallow sills are obstacles to the flow of heavy salt water from the kattegat into the basins around bornholm and gotland the kattegat and the southwestern baltic sea are well oxygenated and have a rich biology  the remainder of the sea is brackish  poor in oxygen and in species  thus  statistically  the more of the entrance that is included in its definition  the healthier the baltic appears  conversely  the more narrowly it is defined  the more endangered its biology appears while tacitus called it mare after the germanic people called the suebi  ptolemy -  sarmatian the first to name it the baltic sea  mare balticum  was the eleventh-century  german chronicler adam of bremen  the origin of the latter name is speculative and it was adopted into slavic and finnic languages spoken around the sea very likely due to the role of medieval latin in cartography  it might be connected to the germanic word belt  a name used for two of the danish straits  the belts  while others claim it to be directly derived from the source of the germanic word  latin balteus adam of bremen himself compared the sea with a belt  stating that it is so named because it stretches through the land as a belt  balticus  eo quod in modum baltei longo tractu per scithicas regiones tendatur usque in greciam   he might also have been influenced by the name of a legendary island mentioned in the natural history of pliny the elder  pliny mentions an island named baltia  or balcia  with reference to accounts of pytheas and xenophon  it is possible that pliny refers to an island named basilia   kingdom  or  royal   in on the ocean by pytheas  baltia also might be derived from  belt  and mean  near belt of sea  strait    meanwhile  others have suggested that the name of the island originates from the proto-indo-european  root  bhel meaning white  fair  this root and its basic meaning were retained in both lithuanian  as baltas  and latvian  as balts   on this basis  a related hypothesis holds that the name originated from this indo-european  root via a baltic language such as another explanation is that  while derived from the aforementioned root  the name of the sea is related to names for various forms of water and related substances in several european languages  that might have been originally associated with colors found in swamps  compare proto-slavic   bolto  swamp    yet another explanation is that the name originally meant  enclosed sea  bay  as opposed to open some swedish historians believe the name derives from the god balder of nordic mythology in the middle ages the sea was known by variety of names  the name baltic sea became dominant only after 1600.  usage of baltic and similar terms to denote the region east of the sea started only in 19th  century the baltic sea was known in ancient latin language sources as mare suebicum or mare older native names in languages that used to be spoken on the shores of the sea or near it usually indicate the geographical location of the sea  in germanic languages   or its size in relation to smaller gulfs  in old latvian   or tribes associated with it  in old russian the sea was known as the varanghian sea   in modern languages it is known by the equivalents of  east sea    west sea   or  baltic sea  in different languages at the time of the roman empire  the baltic sea was known as the mare suebicum or mare sarmaticum  tacitus in his ad 98  agricola and germania described the mare suebicum  named for the suebi tribe  during the spring months  as a brackish sea where the ice broke apart and chunks floated about  the suebi eventually migrated southwest to reside for a while in the rhineland area of modern germany  where their name survives in the historic region known as swabia  jordanes called it the germanic sea in his work  the getica in the early middle ages  norse  scandinavian  merchants built a trade empire all around the baltic  later  the norse fought for control of the baltic against wendish tribes dwelling on the southern shore  the norse also used the rivers of russia for trade routes  finding their way eventually to the black sea and southern russia  this norse-dominated  period is referred to as the viking age since the viking age  the scandinavians have referred to the baltic sea as austmarr   eastern lake     eastern sea   appears in the heimskringla and eystra salt appears in sörla þáttr  saxo grammaticus recorded in gesta danorum an older name  gandvik  -vik  being old norse for  bay   which implies that the vikings correctly regarded it as an inlet of the sea  another form of the name   grandvik   attested in at least one english translation of gesta danorum  is likely to be a misspelling  in addition to fish the sea also provides amber  especially from its southern shores within today s borders of poland  russia and lithuania  first mentions of amber deposits on the south coast of the baltic sea date back to the 12th  the bordering countries have also traditionally exported lumber  wood tar  flax  hemp and furs by ship across the baltic  sweden had from early medieval times exported iron and silver mined there  while poland had and still has extensive salt mines  thus the baltic sea has long been crossed by much merchant shipping the lands on the baltic s eastern shore were among the last in europe to be converted to christianity  this finally happened during the northern crusades  finland in the twelfth century by swedes  and what are now estonia and latvia in the early thirteenth century by danes and germans  livonian brothers of the sword   the teutonic order gained control over parts of the southern and eastern shore of the baltic sea  where they set up their monastic state  lithuania was the last european state to convert to christianity in the period between the 8th  and 14th  centuries  there was much piracy in the baltic from the coasts of pomerania and prussia  and the victual brothers even held gotland starting in the 11th  century  the southern and eastern shores of the baltic were settled by migrants mainly from germany  a movement called the ostsiedlung   east settling    other settlers were from the netherlands  denmark  and scotland  the polabian slavs were gradually assimilated by the denmark gradually gained control over most of the baltic coast  until she lost much of her possessions after being defeated in the 1227  battle of bornhöved in the 13th  to 16th  centuries  the strongest economic force in northern europe was the hanseatic league  a federation of merchant cities around the baltic sea and the north sea  in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries  poland  denmark  and sweden fought wars for dominium maris baltici   lordship over the baltic sea    eventually  it was sweden that virtually encompassed the baltic sea  in sweden the sea was then referred to as mare nostrum balticum   our baltic sea    the goal of swedish warfare during the 17th  century was to make the baltic sea an all-swedish  sea  ett svenskt innanhav   something that was accomplished except the needed  between riga in latvia and szczecin in poland  however  it was the dutch who dominated baltic trade in the seventeenth century in the eighteenth century  russia and prussia became the leading powers over the sea  sweden s defeat in the great northern war brought russia to the eastern coast  russia became and remained a dominating power in the baltic  russia s peter the great saw the strategic importance of the baltic and decided to found his new capital  saint petersburg  at the mouth of the neva river at the east end of the gulf of finland  there was much trading not just within the baltic region but also with the north sea region  especially eastern england and the netherlands  their fleets needed the baltic timber  tar  flax and hemp during the crimean war  a joint british and french fleet attacked the russian fortresses in the baltic  they bombarded sveaborg  which guards helsinki  and kronstadt  which guards saint petersburg  and they destroyed bomarsund in the åland islands  after the unification of germany in 1871,  the whole southern coast became german  world war i was partly fought in the baltic sea  after 1920  poland was connected to the baltic sea by the polish corridor and enlarged the port of gdynia in rivalry with the port of the free city of danzig during world war ii  germany reclaimed all of the southern and much of the eastern shore by occupying poland and the baltic states  in 1945,  the baltic sea became a mass grave for retreating soldiers and refugees on torpedoed troop transports  the sinking of the wilhelm gustloff remains the worst maritime disaster in history  killing  very roughly  9,000  people  in 2005,  a russian group of scientists found over five thousand airplane wrecks  sunken warships  and other material  mainly from world war ii  on the bottom of the sea since the end of world war ii  various nations  including the soviet union  the united kingdom and the united states  have disposed of chemical weapons in the baltic sea  raising concerns of environmental even now fishermen accidentally retrieve some of these materials  the most recent available report from the helsinki commission notes that four small scale catches of chemical munitions representing approximately 105  kg (231  lb  of material were reported in 2005.  this is a reduction from the 25  incidents representing 1,110  kg (2,450  lb  of material in until now  the u s  government refuses to disclose the exact coordinates of the wreck sites  rotting bottles leak lost and other substances  thus slowly poisoning a substantial part of the baltic sea after 1945,  the german population was expelled from all areas east of the oder-neisse  line  making room for displaced poles and russians  poland gained most of the southern shore  the soviet union gained another access to the baltic with the kaliningrad oblast  the baltic states on the eastern shore were annexed by the soviet union  the baltic then separated opposing military blocs  nato and the warsaw pact  had war broken out  the polish navy was prepared to invade the danish isles  this border status restricted trade and travel  it ended only after the collapse of the communist regimes in central and eastern europe in the late 1980s.since  may 2004,  with the accession of the baltic states and poland  the baltic sea has been almost entirely surrounded by countries of the european union  eu   the only remaining non-eu  shore areas are russian  the saint petersburg area and the exclave of the kaliningrad oblast winter storms begin arriving in the region during october  these have caused numerous shipwrecks  and contributed to the extreme difficulties of rescuing passengers of the ferry m s estonia en route from tallinn  estonia  to stockholm  sweden  in september 1994,  which claimed the lives of 852  people  older  wood-based  shipwrecks such as the vasa tend to remain well-preserved,  as the baltic s cold and brackish water does not suit the shipworm storm surge floodings are generally taken to occur when the water level is more than one metre above normal  in warnemünde about 110  floods occurred from 1950  to 2000,  an average of just over two per flood events were the all saints  flood of 1304  and other floods in the years 1320,  1449,  1625,  1694,  1784  and 1825.  little is known of their from 1872,  there exist regular and reliable records of water levels in the baltic sea  the highest was the flood of 1872  when the water was an average of 2.43  m (8  ft 0  in  above sea level at warnemünde and a maximum of 2.83  m (9  ft 3  in  above sea level in warnemünde  in the last very heavy floods the average water levels reached 1.88  m (6  ft 2  in  above sea level in 1904,  1.89  m (6  ft 2  in  in 1913,  1.73  m (5  ft 8  in  in january

annual maximum for about 45%  of its surface area  the ice-covered  area during such a typical winter includes the gulf of bothnia  the gulf of finland  the gulf of riga  the archipelago west of estonia  the stockholm archipelago  and the archipelago sea southwest of finland  the remainder of the baltic does not freeze during a normal winter  with the exception of sheltered bays and shallow lagoons such as the curonian lagoon  the ice reaches its maximum extent in february or march  typical ice thickness in the northernmost areas in the bothnian bay  the northern basin of the gulf of bothnia  is about 70  cm (28  in  for landfast sea ice  the thickness decreases farther south freezing begins in the northern extremities of gulf of bothnia typically in the middle of november  reaching the open waters of the bothnian bay in early january  the bothnian sea  the basin south of kvarken  freezes on average in late february  the gulf of finland and the gulf of riga freeze typically in late january  in 2011,  the gulf of finland was completely frozen on 15  ice extent depends on whether the winter is mild  moderate  or severe  severe winters can lead to ice formation around southern sweden and even in the danish straits  according to the 18th-century  natural historian william derham  during the severe winters of 1703  and 1708,  the ice cover reached as far as the danish frequently  parts of the gulf of bothnia and gulf of finland are frozen  in addition to coastal fringes in more southerly locations such as the gulf of riga  this description meant that the whole of the baltic sea was covered with ice it is known that since 1720,  the baltic sea has frozen over entirely a total of 20  times  the most recent case was in early 1987,  which was the most severe winter in scandinavia since that date  the ice then covered 400,000  km2  (150,000  sq mi   during the winter of 2010–11,  which was quite severe compared to those of the last decades  the maximum ice cover was 315,000  km2  (122,000  sq mi   which was reached on 25  february 2011.  the ice then extended from the north down to the northern tip of gotland  with small ice-free  areas on either side  and the east coast of the baltic sea was covered by an ice sheet about 25  to 100  km (16  to 62  mi  wide all the way to gdańsk  this was brought about by a stagnant high-pressure  area that lingered over central and northern scandinavia from around 10  to 24  february  after this  strong southern winds pushed the ice further into the north  and much of the waters north of gotland were again free of ice  which had then packed against the shores of southern the effects of the afore-mentioned  high-pressure  area did not reach the southern parts of the baltic sea  and thus the entire sea did not freeze over  however  floating ice was additionally observed near świnoujście harbour in january 2010.in  recent years prior to 2011,  the bothnian bay and the bothnian sea were frozen with solid ice near the baltic coast and dense floating ice far from it  in 2008,  there was almost no ice formation except for a short period in winter  fast ice  which is attached to the shoreline  develops first  rendering ports unusable without the services of icebreakers  level ice  ice sludge  pancake ice  and rafter ice form in the more open regions  the gleaming expanse of ice is similar to the arctic  with wind-driven  pack ice and ridges up to 15  m (49  ft   offshore of the landfast ice  the ice remains very dynamic all year  and it is relatively easily moved around by winds and therefore forms pack ice  made up of large piles and ridges pushed against the landfast ice and shores in spring  the gulf of finland and the gulf of bothnia normally thaw in late april  with some ice ridges persisting until may in the eastern extremities of the gulf of finland  in the northernmost reaches of the bothnian bay  ice usually stays until late may  by early june it is practically always gone  however  in the famine year of 1867  remnants of ice were observed as late as july 17  near even as far south as øresund  remnants of ice have been observed in may  near taarbaek on may 15,  1942  and near copenhagen on may 11,  ice cover is the main habitat for two large mammals  the grey seal  halichoerus grypus  and the baltic ringed seal  pusa hispida botnica   both of which feed underneath the ice and breed on its surface  of these two seals  only the baltic ringed seal suffers when there is not adequate ice in the baltic sea  as it feeds its young only while on ice  the grey seal is adapted to reproducing also with no ice in the sea  the sea ice also harbours several species of algae that live in the bottom and inside unfrozen brine pockets in the ice the baltic sea flows out through the danish straits  however  the flow is complex  a surface layer of brackish water discharges 940  km3  (230  cu mi  per year into the north sea  due to the difference in salinity  by salinity permeation principle  a sub-surface  layer of more saline water moving in the opposite direction brings in 475  km3  (114  cu mi  per year  it mixes very slowly with the upper waters  resulting in a salinity gradient from top to bottom  with most of the salt water remaining below 40  to 70  m (130  to 230  ft  deep  the general circulation is anti-clockwise:  northwards along its eastern boundary  and south along the western one difference between the outflow and the inflow comes entirely from fresh water  more than 250  streams drain a basin of about 1,600,000  km2  (620,000  sq mi   contributing a volume of 660  km3  (160  cu mi  per year to the baltic  they include the major rivers of north europe  such as the oder  the vistula  the neman  the daugava and the neva  additional fresh water comes from the difference of precipitation less evaporation  which is positive an important source of salty water are infrequent inflows of north sea water into the baltic  such inflows  important to the baltic ecosystem because of the oxygen they transport into the baltic deeps  used to happen on average every four to five years until the 1980s.  in recent decades they have become less frequent  the latest four occurred in 1983,  1993,  2003  and 2014  suggesting a new inter-inflow  period of about ten years the water level is generally far more dependent on the regional wind situation than on tidal effects  however  tidal currents occur in narrow passages in the western parts of the baltic sea the significant wave height is generally much lower than that of the north sea  violent and sudden storms often sweep the surface  due to large transient temperature differences and a long reach of wind  seasonal winds also cause small changes in sea level  of the order of 0.5  m (1  ft 8  in  baltic sea s salinity is much lower than that of ocean water  which averages 3.5%),  as a result of abundant freshwater runoff from the surrounding land  combined with the shallowness of the sea itself  runoff contributes roughly one-fortieth  its total volume per year  as the volume of the basin is about 21,000  km3  (5,000  cu mi  and yearly runoff is about 500  km3  (120  cu mi   the open surface waters of the central basin have salinity of 0.5%  to 0.8%,  which makes the basin border-line  freshwater  drinking the water as a means of survival would actually hydrate the body instead of dehydrating  as is the case with ocean 1]  at the semi-enclosed  bays with major freshwater inflows  such as the head of finnish gulf with the neva mouth and the head of the bothnian gulf with the close mouths of the lule  tornio and kemi  the salinity is considerably lower  below 40  to 70  m (130  to 230  ft   the salinity is between 1.0%  and 1.5%  in the open baltic sea  and higher near the danish straits  but this is still less than half that of ocean water the flow of fresh water into the sea from approximately two hundred rivers and the introduction of salt from the south builds up a gradient of salinity in the baltic sea  near the danish straits the salinity is close to that of the kattegat  but still not fully oceanic  because the saltiest water that passes the straits is already mixed with considerable amounts of outflow water  the salinity steadily decreases towards north and east  at the northern part of the gulf of bothnia the water is no longer salty and many fresh water species live in the sea  the salinity gradient is paralleled by a temperature gradient  these two factors limit many species of animals and plants to a relatively narrow region of the baltic sea the most saline water is vertically stratified in the water column to the north  creating a barrier to the exchange of oxygen and nutrients  and fostering completely separate maritime rating of mean discharges differs from the ranking of hydrological lengths  from the most distant source to the sea  and the rating of the nominal lengths  göta älv  a

basin is unused open land with another 8%  of wetlands  most of the latter are in the gulfs of bothnia and finland the rest of the land is heavily populated  about 85  million people live in the baltic drainage basin  15  million within 10  km (6  mi  of the coast and 29  million within 50  km (31  mi  of the coast  around 22  million live in population centers of over 250,000.  90%  of these are concentrated in the 10  km (6  mi  band around the coast  of the nations containing all or part of the basin  poland includes 45%  of the 85  million  russia 12%,  sweden 10%  and the others less

tributaries  the gulf of finland and gulf of bothnia  geological surveys show that before the pleistocene  instead of the baltic sea  there was a wide plain around a great river paleontologists call the eridanos  several pleistocene glacial episodes scooped out the river bed into the sea basin  by the time of the last  or eemian stage  mis 5e),  the eemian sea was in place  instead of a true sea  the baltic can even today also be understood as the common estuary of all rivers flowing into it from that time the waters underwent a geologic history summarized under the names listed below  many of the stages are named after marine animals  e g  the littorina mollusk  that are clear markers of changing water temperatures and salinity the factors that determined the sea s characteristics were the submergence or emergence of the region due to the weight of ice and subsequent isostatic readjustment  and the connecting channels it found to the north sea-atlantic,  either through the straits of denmark or at what are now the large lakes of sweden  and the white sea-arctic  sea the land is still emerging isostatically from its depressed state  which was caused by the weight of ice during the last glaciation  the phenomenon is known as post-glacial  rebound  consequently  the surface area and the depth of the sea are diminishing  the uplift is about eight millimetres per year on the finnish coast of the northernmost gulf of bothnia  in the area  the former seabed is only gently sloping  leading to large areas of land being reclaimed in what are  geologically speaking  relatively short periods  decades and centuries  the baltic sea anomaly is a 60-metre  (200  ft  diameter circular rock-like  formation on the floor of the northern baltic sea at the center of the bothnian sea  discovered by peter lindberg  dennis åsberg and their swedish  ocean x  diving team in june 2011.  the team reported that the formation rests on a pillar and includes a structure similar in appearance to a staircase  leading to a dark hole according to ocean x  the formation has an appearance of  rough granite   is round  3  to 4  metres (9.8  to 13.1  ft  thick and approximately 60  metres (200  ft  in diameter  stands on an 8-metre-tall  (26  ft  pillar-like  feature  and is located at a depth of 85  to 90  metres (279  to 295  ft   there is also another smaller object not far the object is at the end of what resembles a 300-metre  (980  ft  ocean x team has published one additional close-up  sonar scan on their web site and nine additional close-up  sonar scans on their youtube page that appear to show a 90-degree  angle and other features of the their second expedition  they reported that they found something that looks like a staircase and a round black hole that goes directly into the fauna of the baltic sea is a mixture of marine and freshwater species  among marine fishes are cod  herring  hake  plaice  flounder  shorthorn sculpin  stickleback and turbot  and examples of freshwater species include perch  pike  whitefish and roach there is a decrease in faunal species from the belts to the gulf of bothnia  the decreasing salinity along this path causes restrictions in both physiology and the lack of tides has affected the marine species as compared with the atlantic since the baltic sea is so young there are only a few endemic species  the mostly asexually reproducing brown alga fucus radicans seems to have evolved in the basin  another endemic is the copenhagen cockle parvicardium hauniense  however  several marine species have populations in the baltic sea adapted to the low salinity  such as the baltic sea herring which is smaller than the atlantic herring a peculiar feature of the fauna is that it contains a number of glacial relict species  isolated populations of arctic species which have remained in the baltic sea since the last glaciation  such as the large isopod saduria entomon  the baltic subspecies of ringed seal  and the fourhorn sculpin  some of these relicts are derived from glacial lakes  such as monoporeia affinis  which is a main element in the benthic fauna of the low-salinity  bothnian bay cetaceans in baltic sea have been monitored by the ascobans  critically endangered populations of atlantic white-sided  dolphins and harbor porpoises inhabit the sea where white-colored  porpoises have been and occasionally oceanic and out-of-range  species such as minke bottlenose beluga and beaked visit the waters  in recent years  very small  but with increasing rates  fin and humpback whales migrate into

bloom covering 377,000  square kilometres (146,000  sq mi  in the baltic sea  the area of the bloom extended from germany and poland to finland  researchers of the phenomenon have indicated that algal blooms have occurred every summer for decades  fertilizer runoff from surrounding agricultural land has exacerbated the problem and led to increased 100,000  km2  (38,610  sq mi  of the baltic s seafloor  a quarter of its total area  is a variable dead zone  the more saline  and therefore denser  water remains on the bottom  isolating it from surface waters and the atmosphere  this leads to decreased oxygen concentrations within the zone  it is mainly bacteria that grow in it  digesting organic material and releasing hydrogen sulfide  because of this large anaerobic zone  the seafloor ecology differs from that of the neighbouring atlantic plans to artificially oxygenate areas of the baltic that have experienced eutrophication have been proposed by the university of gothenburg and inocean ab  the proposal intends to use wind-driven  pumps to inject oxygen  air  into waters at  or around  130m  below sea of the great belt bridge in denmark  completed 1997)  and the øresund bridge-tunnel   completed 1999),  linking denmark with sweden  provided a highway and railroad connection between sweden and the danish mainland  the jutland peninsula  precisely the zealand   the undersea tunnel of the øresund bridge-tunnel  provides for navigation of large ships into and out of the baltic sea  the baltic sea is the main trade route for export of russian petroleum  many of the countries neighboring the baltic sea have been concerned about this  since a major oil leak in a seagoing tanker would be disastrous for the baltic—given the slow exchange of water  the tourism industry surrounding the baltic sea is naturally concerned about oil pollution much shipbuilding is carried out in the shipyards around the baltic sea  the largest shipyards are at gdańsk  gdynia  and szczecin  poland  kiel  germany  karlskrona and malmö  sweden  rauma  turku  and helsinki  finland  riga  ventspils  and liepāja  latvia  klaipėda  lithuania  and saint petersburg  russia there are several cargo and passenger ferries that operate on the baltic sea  such as scandlines  silja line  polferries  the viking line  tallink  and superfast ferries piersresort townsfor the first time ever  all the sources of pollution around an entire sea were made subject to a single convention  signed in 1974  by the then seven baltic coastal states  the 1974  convention entered into force on 3  may 1980.in  the light of political changes and developments in international environmental and maritime law  a new convention was signed in 1992  by all the states bordering on the baltic sea  and the european community  after ratification the convention entered into force on 17  january 2000.  the convention covers the whole of the baltic sea area  including inland waters and the water of the sea itself  as well as the seabed  measures are also taken in the whole catchment area of the baltic sea to reduce land-based  pollution  the convention on the protection of the marine environment of the baltic sea area  1992,  entered into force on 17  january 2000.the  governing body of the convention is the helsinki also known as helcom  or baltic marine environment protection commission  the present contracting parties are denmark  estonia  the european community  finland  germany  latvia  lithuania  poland  russia and sweden the ratification instruments were deposited by the european community  germany  latvia and sweden in 1994,  by estonia and finland in 1995,  by denmark in 1996,  by lithuania in 1997  and by poland and russia in november 1999.notesbibliographyfurther  reading
