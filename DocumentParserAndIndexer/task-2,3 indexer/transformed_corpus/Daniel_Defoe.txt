 daniel defoe   dɪˈfoʊ   c  1660  – 24  april born daniel foe  was an english trader  writer  journalist  pamphleteer  and spy  he is most famous for his novel robinson crusoe  which is second only to the bible in its number of defoe is noted for being one of the earliest proponents of the novel  as he helped to popularise the form in britain with others such as aphra behn and samuel richardson  and is among the founders of the english defoe wrote many political tracts and often was in trouble with the authorities  including prison time  intellectuals and political leaders paid attention to his fresh ideas and sometimes consulted with him defoe was a prolific and versatile writer  producing more than three hundred – books  pamphlets  and journals – on diverse topics  including politics  crime  religion  marriage  psychology  and the supernatural  he was also a pioneer of business and economic foe  his original name  was probably born in fore street in the parish of st  giles cripplegate  defoe later added the aristocratic-sounding   de  to his name  and on occasion claimed descent from the family of de beau faux  his birthdate and birthplace are uncertain  and sources offer dates from 1659  to 1662,  with the summer or early autumn of 1660  considered the most his father james foe was a prosperous tallow chandler and a member of the worshipful company of butchers  in defoe s early life  he experienced some of the most unusual occurrences in english history  in 1665,  70,000  were killed by the great plague of london  and next year  the great fire of london left standing only defoe s and two other houses in his in 1667,  when he was probably about seven  a dutch fleet sailed up the medway via the river thames and attacked the town of chatham in the raid on the medway  his mother annie had died by the time he was about was educated at the rev  james fisher s boarding school in pixham lane in dorking  his parents were presbyterian dissenters  and around the age of 14,  he attended a dissenting academy at newington green in london run by charles morton  and he is believed to have attended the newington green unitarian during this period  the english government persecuted those who chose to worship outside the church of england defoe entered the world of business as a general merchant  dealing at different times in hosiery  general woollen goods  and wine  his ambitions were great and he was able to buy a country estate and a ship  as well as civets to make perfume   though he was rarely out of debt  he was forced to declare bankruptcy in on 1  january 1684,  defoe married mary tuffley at st botolph  aldgate  she was the daughter of a london merchant  receiving a dowry of £3,700  – a huge amount by the standards of the day  with his debts and political difficulties  the marriage may have been troubled  but it lasted 50  years and produced eight 1685,  defoe joined the ill-fated  monmouth rebellion but gained a pardon  by which he escaped the bloody assizes of judge george jeffreys  queen mary and her husband william iii were jointly crowned in 1688,  and defoe became one of william s close allies and a secret some of the new policies led to conflict with france  thus damaging prosperous trade relationships for defoe  who had established himself as a in 1692,  defoe was arrested for debts of £700    though his total debts may have amounted to £17,000.  his laments were loud and he always defended unfortunate debtors  but there is evidence that his financial dealings were not always needed   he died with little wealth and evidence of lawsuits with the royal his release  he probably traveled in europe and and it may have been at this time that he traded wine to cadiz  porto  and lisbon  by 1695,  he was back in england  now formally using the name  defoe  and serving as a  commissioner of the glass duty   responsible for collecting taxes on bottles  in 1696,  he ran a tile and brick factory in what is now tilbury in essex and lived in the parish of chadwell st mary defoe s first notable publication was an essay upon projects  a series of proposals for social and economic improvement  published in 1697.  from 1697  to 1698,  he defended the right of king william iii to a standing army during disarmament  after the treaty of ryswick (1697)  had ended the nine years  war (1688–97).  his most successful poem  the true-born  englishman (1701),  defended the king against the perceived xenophobia of his enemies  satirising the english claim to racial purity  in 1701,  defoe presented the legion s memorial to the speaker of the house of commons  later his employer robert harley  flanked by a guard of sixteen gentlemen of quality  it demanded the release of the kentish petitioners  who had asked parliament to support the king in an imminent war against france the death of william iii in 1702  once again created a political upheaval  as the king was replaced by queen anne who immediately began her offensive against defoe was a natural target  and his pamphleteering and political activities resulted in his arrest and placement in a pillory on 31  july 1703,  principally on account of his december 1702  pamphlet entitled the shortest-way  with the dissenters  or  proposals for the establishment of the church  purporting to argue for their in it  he ruthlessly satirised both the high church tories and those dissenters who hypocritically practised so-called   occasional conformity   such as his stoke newington neighbour sir thomas abney  it was published anonymously  but the true authorship was quickly discovered and defoe was he was charged with seditious libel  defoe was found guilty after a trial at the old bailey in front of the notoriously sadistic judge salathiel lovell sentenced him to a punitive fine  to public humiliation in a pillory  and to an indeterminate length of imprisonment which would only end upon the discharge of the punitive according to legend  the publication of his poem hymn to the pillory caused his audience at the pillory to throw flowers instead of the customary harmful and noxious objects and to drink to his health  the truth of this story is questioned by most scholars  although john robert moore later said that  no man in england but defoe ever stood in the pillory and later rose to eminence among his fellow his three days in the pillory  defoe went into newgate prison  robert harley  1st  earl of oxford and earl mortimer  brokered his release in exchange for defoe s co-operation  as an intelligence agent for the tories  in exchange for such co-operation  with the rival political side  harley paid some of defoe s outstanding debts  improving his financial situation within a week of his release from prison  defoe witnessed the great storm of 1703,  which raged through the night of 26/27  november  it caused severe damage to london and bristol  uprooted millions of trees  and killed more than 8,000  people  mostly at sea  the event became the subject of defoe s the storm (1704),  which includes a collection of witness accounts of the many regard it as one of the world s first examples of modern in the same year  he set up his periodical a review of the affairs of france which supported the harley ministry  chronicling the events of the war of the spanish succession (1702–1714).  the review ran three times a week without interruption until 1713.  defoe was amazed that a man as gifted as harley left vital state papers lying in the open  and warned that he was almost inviting an unscrupulous clerk to commit treason  his warnings were fully justified by the william gregg affair  when harley was ousted from the ministry in 1708,  defoe continued writing the review to support godolphin  then again to support harley and the tories in the tory ministry of 1710–1714.  the tories fell from power with the death of queen anne  but defoe continued doing intelligence work for the whig government  writing  tory  pamphlets that undermined the tory point of all of defoe s pamphlet writing was political  one pamphlet was originally published anonymously  entitled  a true relation of the apparition of one mrs  veal the next day after her death to one mrs  bargrave at canterbury the 8th  of september  1705."  it deals with interaction between the spiritual realm and the physical realm and was most likely written in support of charles drelincourt s the christian defense against the fears of death (1651).  it describes mrs  bargrave s encounter with her old friend mrs  veal after she had died  it is clear from this piece and other writings that the political portion of defoe s life was by no means his only focus as many as 545  titles have been ascribed to defoe  ranging from satirical poems  political and religious pamphlets  and volumes   furbank and owens argue for the much smaller number of 276  published items in critical bibliography (1998).)  his ambitious business ventures saw him bankrupt by 1692,  with a wife and seven children to support  in 1703,  he published a satirical pamphlet against the high tories and in favour of religious tolerance entitled the shortest-way  with the dissenters  or  proposals for the establishment of the church  this pamphlet was widely misunderstood  as has happened with other ironic writings since  but eventually its author was prosecuted for seditious libel and was sentenced to be pilloried  fined 200  marks  and detained at the queen s pleasure in despair  he wrote to william paterson  the london scot and founder of the bank of england and part instigator of the darien scheme  who was in the confidence of robert harley  1st  earl of oxford and earl mortimer  leading minister and spymaster in the english government  harley accepted defoe s services and released him in 1703.  he immediately published the review  which appeared weekly  then three times a week  written mostly by himself  this was the main mouthpiece of the english government promoting the act of union 1707.in  1709,  defoe authored a rather lengthy book entitled the history of the union of great britain  an edinburgh publication printed by the heirs of the book was not published anonymously and cites defoe twice as being its the book attempts to explain the facts leading up to the act of union 1707,  dating all the way back to 6  december 1604  when king james was presented with a proposal for this so-called   first draft  for unification took place 100  years before the signing of the 1707  accord  which respectively preceded the commencement of robinson crusoe by another ten years defoe began his campaign in the review and other pamphlets aimed at english opinion  claiming that it would end the threat from the north  gaining for the treasury an  inexhaustible treasury of men   a valuable new market increasing the power of england  by september 1706,  harley ordered defoe to edinburgh as a secret agent to do everything possible to help secure acquiescence in the treaty of union  he was conscious of the risk to himself  thanks to books such as the letters of daniel defoe  edited by g  h  healey  oxford 1955),  far more is known about his activities than is usual with such agents his first reports included vivid descriptions of violent demonstrations against the union   a scots rabble is the worst of its kind   he reported  years later john clerk of penicuik  a leading unionist  wrote in his memoirs that it was not known at the time that defoe had been sent by godolphin      to give a faithful account to him from time to time how everything past here  he was therefor a spy among us  but not known to be such  otherways the mob of edin  had pull him to was a presbyterian who had suffered in england for his convictions  and as such he was accepted as an adviser to the general assembly of the church of scotland and committees of the parliament of scotland  he told harley that he was  privy to all their folly  but  perfectly unsuspected as with corresponding with anybody in england   he was then able to influence the proposals that were put to parliament and reported having had the honour to be always sent for the committee to whom these amendments were referrèd  i have had the good fortune to break their measures in two particulars via the bounty on corn and proportion of the excise for scotland  he used different arguments  even the opposite of those which he used in england  usually ignoring the english doctrine of the sovereignty of parliament  for example  telling the scots that they could have complete confidence in the guarantees in the treaty  some of his pamphlets were purported to be written by scots  misleading even reputable historians into quoting them as evidence of scottish opinion of the time  the same is true of a massive history of the union which defoe published in 1709  and which some historians still treat as a valuable contemporary source for their own works  defoe took pains to give his history an air of objectivity by giving some space to arguments against the union but always having the last word for himself he disposed of the main union opponent  andrew fletcher of saltoun  by ignoring him  nor does he account for the deviousness of the duke of hamilton  the official leader of the various factions opposed to the union  who seemingly betrayed his former colleagues when he switched to the unionist government side in the decisive final stages of the debate defoe made no attempt to explain why the same parliament of scotland which was so vehement for its independence from 1703  to 1705  became so supine in 1706.  he received very little reward from his paymasters and of course no recognition for his services by the government  he made use of his scottish experience to write his tour thro  the whole island of great britain  published in 1726,  where he admitted that the increase of trade and population in scotland which he had predicted as a consequence of the union was  not the case  but rather the contrary  defoe s description of glasgow  glaschu  as a  dear green place  has often been misquoted as a gaelic translation for the town s name  the gaelic glas could mean grey or green  while chu means dog or hollow  glaschu probably means  green hollow   the  dear green place   like much of scotland  was a hotbed of unrest against the union  the local tron minister urged his congregation  to up and anent for the city of god  the  dear green place  and  city of god  required government troops to put down the rioters tearing up copies of the treaty at almost every mercat cross in scotland  when defoe visited in the mid-1720s,  he claimed that the hostility towards his party was  because they were english and because of the union  which they were almost universally exclaimed needed  the extent and particulars are widely contested concerning defoe s writing in the period from the tory fall in 1714  to the publication of robinson crusoe in 1719.  defoe comments on the tendency to attribute tracts of uncertain authorship to him in his apologia appeal to honour and justice (1715),  a defence of his part in harley s tory ministry (1710–14).  other works that anticipate his novelistic career include the family instructor (1715),  a conduct manual on religious duty  minutes of the negotiations of monsr  mesnager (1717),  in which he impersonates nicolas mesnager  the french plenipotentiary who negotiated the treaty of utrecht (1713);  and a continuation of the letters writ by a turkish spy (1718),  a satire of european politics and religion  ostensibly written by a muslim in paris from 1719  to 1724,  defoe published the novels for which he is famous  see below   in the final decade of his life  he also wrote conduct manuals  including religious courtship (1722),  the complete english tradesman (1726)  and the new family instructor (1727).  he published a number of books decrying the breakdown of the social order  such as the great law of subordination considered (1724)  and everybody s business is nobody s business (1725)  and works on the supernatural  like the political history of the devil (1726),  a system of magick (1727)  and an essay on the history and reality of apparitions (1727).  his works on foreign travel and trade include a general history of discoveries and improvements (1727)  and atlas maritimus and commercialis (1728).  perhaps his greatest achievement with the novels is the magisterial a tour thro  the whole island of great britain (1724–27),  which provided a panoramic survey of british trade on the eve of the industrial revolution published in 1726,  the complete english tradesman is an example of defoe s political works  he discusses the role of the tradesman in england in comparison to tradesmen internationally  arguing that the british system of trade is far he also implies that trade is the backbone of the british economy   estate s a pond  but trade s a spring   he praises the practicality of trade not only within the economy but the social stratification as well  most of the british gentry  he argues is at one time or another inextricably linked with the institution of trade  either through personal experience  marriage  or oftentimes younger members of noble families entered into trade  marriage to a tradesmen s daughter by a nobleman was also common  overall defoe demonstrated a high respect for tradesmen  being one himself not only does defoe elevate individual british tradesmen to the level of gentleman  but he praises the entirety of british trade as a superior trade  defoe argues is a much better catalyst for social and economic change than war  he states that through imperialism and trade expansion the british empire is able to  increase commerce at home  through job creation and increased he states that increased consumption  by laws of supply and demand  increases production and in turn raises wages for the poor therefore lifting part of british society further out of novel robinson crusoe (1719),  written when he was in his late relates the story of a man s shipwreck on a desert island for thirty years and his subsequent adventures  usually read as fiction  a coincidence of background geography suggests that this may be non-fiction.  in the opening pages of the farther adventures of robinson crusoe  the author describes how crusoe settled in bedford  married and produced a family  and that when his wife died  he went off on these further adventures  bedford is also the place where the brother of  h  f   in a journal of the plague year retired to avoid the danger of the plague  so that by implication  if these works were not fiction  defoe s family met crusoe in bedford  from whence the information in these books was gathered  defoe went to school in stoke newington  london  with a friend named caruso the novel has been assumed to be based in part on the story of the scottish castaway alexander selkirk  who spent four years stranded in the juan fernández but this is inconsistent with the details of the narrative  the island selkirk lived on was named más a tierra  closer to land  at the time and was renamed robinson crusoe island in 1966.  it has been supposed that defoe may have also been inspired by the latin or english translation of a book by the andalusian-arab  muslim polymath ibn tufail  who was known as  abubacer  in europe  the latin edition of the book was entitled philosophus autodidactus and it was an earlier novel that is also set on a deserted next novel was captain singleton (1720),  an adventure story whose first half covers a traversal of africa and whose second half taps into the

ceaseless chant of doom echoed through a city of emptied streets and filled grave pits  for this was london in the year of 1665,  the year of the great plague     in 1721,  when the black death again threatened the european continent  daniel defoe wrote  a journal of the plague year  to alert an indifferent populace to the horror that was almost upon them  through the eyes of a saddler who had

picaresque novel of the fall and eventual redemption of a lone woman in 17th-century  england  the titular heroine appears as a whore  bigamist  and thief  lives in the mint  commits adultery and incest  and yet manages to retain the reader s sympathy  her savvy manipulation of both men and wealth earns her a life of trials but ultimately an ending in reward  moll flanders is an important work in the development of the novel  as it challenged the common perception of femininity and gender roles in 17th-century  british society roxanamoll flanders and defoe s final novel  roxana  the fortunate mistress (1724),  are examples of the remarkable way in which defoe seems to inhabit his fictional characters  yet  drawn from life    not least in that they are women  roxanna narrates the moral and spiritual decline of a high society courtesan  roxanna differs from other defoe works because the main character does not exhibit a conversion experience daniel defoe died on 24  april 1731,
