 the haddock  melanogrammus aeglefinus  is a saltwater fish  found in the north atlantic ocean and associated seas the haddock is easily recognized by a black lateral line running along its white side  not to be confused with pollock which has the reverse  i e   white line on black side  and a distinctive dark blotch above the pectoral fin  often described as a  thumbprint  or even the  devil s thumbprint  or  st  peter s is most commonly found at depths of 40  to 133  m (131  to 436  ft   but has a range as deep as 300  m (980  ft   it thrives in temperatures of 2  to 10  °c (36  to 50  °f   juveniles prefer shallower waters and larger adults deeper water  generally  adult haddock do not engage in long migratory behaviour as do the younger fish  but seasonal movements have been known to occur across all ages  haddock feed primarily on small invertebrates  although larger members of the species may occasionally consume fish haddock range in size between 38  and 69  centimeters in length and 0.9  to 1.8  kilograms in growth rates of haddock have changed significantly over the past 30  to 40  years  presently  growth is more rapid  with haddock reaching their adult size much earlier than previously noted  however  the degree to which these younger fish contribute to reproductive success of the population is unknown  growth rates of haddock  however  had slowed in recent years  some evidence indicates it may be the result of an exceptionally large year class in 2003.  in citation given  spawning occurs between january and june  peaking during late march and early april  the most important spawning grounds are in the waters off middle norway  near southwest iceland  and georges bank  an average-sized  female produces approximately 850,000  eggs  and larger females are capable of producing up to 3  million eggs each year cod and related species are plagued by parasites  for example  the cod worm  lernaeocera branchialis  starts life as a copepod  a small  free-swimming  crustacean larva  the first host used by cod worm is a flatfish or lumpsucker  which they capture with grasping hooks at the front of their bodies  they penetrate the lumpsucker with a thin filament which they use to suck its blood  the nourished cod worms then mate on the female worm  with her now fertilized eggs  then finds a cod  or a cod-like  fish such as a haddock or whiting  there  the worm clings to the gills while it metamorphoses into a plump  sinusoidal  wormlike body  with a coiled mass of egg strings at the rear  the front part of the worm s body penetrates the body of the cod until it enters the rear bulb of the host s heart  there  firmly rooted in the cod s circulatory system  the front part of the parasite develops like the branches of a tree  reaching into the main artery  in this way  the worm extracts nutrients from the cod s blood  remaining safely tucked beneath the cod s gill cover until it releases a new generation of offspring into the sizes up to 1.1  m (3  ft 7  in   haddock is fished for year-round.  some of the methods used are danish seine nets  trawlers  long lines and fishing nets  the commercial catch of haddock in north america had declined sharply in recent years  but is now recovering  with recruitment rates running around where they historically were from the 1930s  to 2010,  greenpeace international has added the haddock to its seafood red list   the greenpeace international seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world  and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable populations on the offshore grounds of georges bank off new england and nova scotia have made a remarkable comeback with the adoption of catch shares management program  and are currently harvested at only a fraction of sustainable yields haddock is a very popular food fish  sold fresh  smoked  frozen  dried  or to a small extent canned  haddock  along with atlantic cod and plaice  is one of the most popular fish used in british fish and chips fresh haddock has clean  white flesh and can be cooked in the same ways as cod  freshness of a haddock fillet can be determined by how well it holds together  as a fresh one will be firm  also  fillets should be translucent  while older fillets turn chalky  nearly opaque   young  fresh haddock and cod fillets are often sold as scrod in boston  massachusetts  this refers to the size of the fish which have a variety of sizes  i e   scrod  markets  and cows  haddock is the predominant fish of choice in scotland in a fish supper  it is also the main ingredient of norwegian fishballs  fiskeboller  unlike the related cod  haddock does not salt well and is often preserved by drying and smoking the smoking of haddock was highly refined in grimsby  traditional grimsby smoked fish  mainly haddock  but sometimes cod  is produced in the traditional smokehouses in grimsby  which are mostly family-run  businesses that have developed their skills over many grimsby fish market sources its haddock from the north east atlantic  principally iceland  norway and the faroe islands  these fishing grounds are sustainably and have not seen the large scale depreciation in fish stocks seen in eu popular form of haddock is finnan haddie which takes its name from the fishing village of finnan or findon in scotland  where it was originally cold-smoked  over peat  finnan haddie is often served poached in milk for town of arbroath on the east coast of scotland produces the arbroath smokie  this is a hot-smoked  haddock which

anglo-indian  dish kedgeree  and also in the scottish dish  cullen skink   a  chowder  like soup
