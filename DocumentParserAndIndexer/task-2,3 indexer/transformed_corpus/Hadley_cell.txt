 the hadley cell  named after george hadley  is a global scale tropical atmospheric circulation that features air rising near the equator  flowing poleward at 10–15  kilometers above the surface  descending in the subtropics  and then returning equatorward near the surface  this circulation creates the trade winds  tropical rain-belts  and hurricanes  subtropical deserts and the jet streams in each hemisphere  there is one primary circulation cell known as a hadley cell and two secondary circulation cells at higher latitudes  between 30°  and 60°  latitude known as the ferrel cell  and beyond 60°  as the polar cell  each hadley cell operates between zero and 30  to 40  degrees north and south and is mainly responsible for the weather in the equatorial regions of the world the major driving force of atmospheric circulation is the uneven distribution of solar heating across the earth  which is greatest near the equator and lesser at the poles  the atmospheric circulation transports energy polewards  thus reducing the resulting equator-to-pole  temperature gradient  the mechanisms by which this is accomplished differ in tropical and extratropical latitudes hadley cells exist on either side of the equator  each cell encircles the globe latitudinally and acts to transport energy from the equator to about the 30th  latitude  the circulation exhibits the following hadley circulation exhibits seasonal variation  during the solstitial seasons  djf and jja   the upward branch of the hadley cell occurs not directly over the equator but rather in the summer hemisphere  in the annual mean  the upward branch is slightly offset into the northern hemisphere  making way for a stronger hadley cell in the southern hemisphere  this evidences a small net energy transport from the northern to the southern hadley system provides an example of a thermally direct circulation  the thermodynamic efficiency of the hadley system  considered as a heat engine  has been relatively constant over the 1979~2010  period  averaging 2.6%.  over the same interval  the power generated by the hadley regime has risen at an average rate of about 0.54  tw per yr  this reflects an increase in energy input to the system consistent with the observed increasing of tropical sea surface mean meridional circulation cells such as the hadley circulation are not particularly efficient at reducing the equator-to-pole  temperature gradient due to cancellation between transports of different types of energy  in the hadley cell  both sensible and latent heat are transported equatorward near the surface  while potential energy is transported above in the opposite direction  poleward  the resulting net poleward transport is only about 10%  of this potential energy transport  this is partly a result of the strong constraints imposed on atmospheric motions by the conservation of angular the early 18th  century  george hadley  an english lawyer and amateur meteorologist  was dissatisfied with the theory that the astronomer edmond halley had proposed for explaining the trade winds  what was no doubt correct in halley s theory was that solar heating creates upward motion of equatorial air  and air mass from neighboring latitudes must flow in to replace the risen air mass  but for the westward component of the trade winds halley had proposed that in moving across the sky the sun heats the air mass differently over the course of the day  hadley was not satisfied with that part of halley s theory and rightly so  hadley was the first to recognize that earth s rotation plays a role in the direction taken by an air mass as it moves relative to the earth  hadley s theory  published in 1735,  remained unknown  but it was rediscovered independently several times  among the re-discoverers  was john dalton  who later learned of hadley s priority  over time the mechanism proposed by hadley became accepted  and over time his name was increasingly attached to it  by the end of the 19th  century it was shown that hadley s theory was deficient in several respects  one of the first who accounted for the dynamics correctly was william ferrel  it took many decades for the correct theory to become accepted  and even today hadley s theory can still be encountered occasionally  particularly in popular books and hadley s theory was the generally accepted theory long enough to make his name become universally attached to the circulation pattern in the tropical atmosphere  in 1980  isaac held and arthur hou developed the held-hou  model to describe the hadley circulation the region in which the equatorward moving air masses converge and rise  is known as the intertropical convergence zone  or itcz  within that zone develops a band of thunderstorms that produce high-precipitation.having  lost most of its water vapor to condensation and precipitation in the upward branch of the hadley cell circulation  the descending air is dry  as the air descends  low relative humidities are produced as the air is warmed adiabatically by compression from the overlying air  producing a region of higher pressure  the subtropics are relatively free of the convection  or thunderstorms  that are common in the equatorial belt  many of the world s deserts are located in these subtropical latitudes  although the deserts do not extend to the eastern side of the various continents because of ocean currents caused by the trade winds there is some evidence that the expansion of the hadley cells is related to climate the majority of earth s arid regions are located in the areas beneath the descending part of the hadley circulation at around 30  degrees those models show that the hadley cell will expand with increased global mean temperature  perhaps by 2  degrees latitude over the 21st  century this might lead to large changes in precipitation in the latitudes at the edge of the scientists fear that global warming might bring changes to the ecosystems in the deep tropics and that the deserts will become drier and as the areas around 30  degrees latitude become drier  those inhabiting that region will see less rainfall than traditionally expected  which could cause difficulty with food supplies and there is strong evidence of paleoclimate climate change in central africa s rain forest in c  850  palynological  fossil pollen  evidence shows a drastic change in rain forest biome to that of open savannah as a consequence of wide-scale  drying not connected necessarily to intermittent drought but perhaps to gradual warming  the hypothesis  that a decline in solar activity reduces the latitudinal extent of the hadley circulation and decreases mid-latitudinal  monsoon intensity  is matched by data  showing increased dryness in central west africa and increase in precipitation in temperate zones north  meanwhile  mid-latitudinal  storm tracks in the temperate zones increased and moved
