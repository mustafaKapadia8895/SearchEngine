 a small craft advisory is a type of warning issued by the national weather service in the united states  it is issued when winds have reached  or are expected to reach within 12  hours  a speed marginally less than gale force  a small craft advisory may also be issued when sea or lake ice exists that could be hazardous to small insignia that denotes a small craft advisory is one red  triangular flag  two such flags  one placed above the other  signify a gale warning  the term wind advisory is used in place of small craft advisory when winds of the same force occur at  or are forecast for  inland locations  a lake wind advisory is issued for winds just below this range  because unobstructed winds across the open waters of a lake are normally faster than across land the wind speed that triggers the advisory has changed over time  until the late 1960s,  the threshold was 32  to 38  miles per hour  or 28  to 33  knots   at some point  the lower limit was reduced to 23  miles per hour (20  knots   today  however  most places have standardized on 25  to 38  miles per hour (22  to 33  knots   encompassing the combined ranges of forces 6  and 7  on the beaufort scale occasionally an informal lesser advisory  known as  small craft exercise caution   is issued for wind speeds lighter than those that call for a small craft advisory  criteria for this vary in different localities  sometimes a range of 19  to 24  miles per hour (17  to 21  knots  is observed  or in some places 17  to 23  miles per hour (15  to 19  knots  may be used the national weather service does not specifically identify what constitutes a  small craft   the size of the boat is only part of what a person should consider when venturing out under such a warning  weight  displacement and hull design are also important factors and an even more important consideration is not only the craft  but the experience of the captain the next step above these advisories is a high wind warning  all such bulletins may also be issued for areas above a particular elevation  as wind speeds tend to increase with altitude in the mountains as of 15  february 1989,  the national weather service retired its coastal warning display network over 100  years  display stations were established at yacht clubs  marinas  and coast guard stations to hoist flags  pennants and colored lights to warn mariners of storms at sea  the display stations were individually notified by the national weather service to raise the signals and again to lower them when the hazards passed  the national weather service paid for the visual signals  however  the display stations were operated by other agencies or volunteers  although the coastal warning display program has been formally discontinued  u s  coast guard and other stations may continue to display warning signals without the direct participation of the national weather service beginning 1  june 2007,  u s  coast guard formally re-established  a coastal warning display program at selected small boat stations which will hoist display flags to warn of small craft advisories  gale warnings  tropical storm warnings  storm warnings  hurricane warnings  and hurricane force wind coastal warning display program was de-emphasized  in favor of frequently updated telephone recordings and noaa weather radio  the latter covers the coastal areas of continental united states  alaska  hawaii  and the mariana islands with continuous weather broadcasts  the major shortcomings of the coastal warning display program were that the displays reached only the small portion of the marine public within sight of them  it cannot convey specific information on movement  intensity  and duration  and the time required to notify the sites by individual telephone calls takes the forecaster away from critical tasks associated with the weather  further  when users perceive them to be a full substitute for noaa weather radio  other radio broadcasts  and the telephone recordings  they are actually being a disservice a similar warning  known as a strong wind warning  is issued by environment canada s meteorological service of canada from its different offices for the pacific  atlantic  and arctic waters  these warnings are coordinated for the great lakes region with american neighboring offices strong wind warning was previously referred to as small craft warning and is still (2012)  referred to as such in many publications  a strong wind warning is issued for winds in the range 20–33  knots and wave heights 2–3  metres this is an example of a small craft advisory from the national weather service forecast office in los angeles
