 the recent african origin of modern humans  also called the  out of africa  theory  ooa   recent single-origin  hypothesis  rsoh   replacement hypothesis  or recent african origin model  rao   is  in paleoanthropology  the dominant model of the geographic origin and early migration of anatomically modern humans  homo sapiens   the model proposes a single area of origin for modern humans  the single-origin  hypothesis is cited as having the scientific consensus as of the to this model  modern humans evolved in east africa between 400,000  and 200,000  years ago  and then began to disperse throughout the world roughly 70,000  to 135,000  years ago  as of 2011,  it appears likely that there were two waves of migration out of africa the first wave took place between 130,000–115,000  years ago via northern and appears to have mostly died out or retreated  although there is some evidence of a presence of modern humans in china about 80,000  years in the 2010s,  genomic testing of living populations has located archaic admixture of modern humans outside of africa with neanderthals and second dispersal took place after the toba supereruption  ca  77,000  years ago  via the so-called  southern route  following the southern coastline of asia  which led to the lasting colonization of australia by around 65,000-50,000  years 2]  while europe was populated by an early offshoot which settled the near east and europe less than 55,000  years archaic view of hominid evolution  polygenism  holds that different human peoples had differing origins  many religious texts refer to this concept  from 1984  to 2003,  an alternate scientific hypothesis was the multiregional origin of modern humans  which envisioned a wave of homo sapiens migrating earlier from africa and interbreeding with local homo erectus populations in varied regions of the  humans  and the pan  chimpanzee  genera of hominini diverged between 4  and 13  million years ago  in africa anatomically modern humans had originated in africa by about 200,000  years ago  documented by the find of the omo remains in south-western  ethiopia  there is strong evidence that homo sapiens sapiens coexisted with other morphologically distinct hominids at this homo sapiens idaltu  found at site middle awash in ethiopia  lived about 160,000  years 2017,  fossils attributed to h  sapiens  along with stone tools  dated to approximately 300,000  years ago  were unearthed at jebel irhoud  in these finds have facial features in common with anatomically modern humans and distinct from h  erectus  while the shape of the brain case remains to be determined  in 2017,  genomic testing has produced results related to population divergences of h sapiens groups within africa  as detailed below in the section genetic reconstruction -  mitochondrial haplogroups -  within africa  the san people of southern africa and the sandawe people of east africa branched off between 260,000  and 350,000  years ago and have remained relatively genetically isolated since then  the san people are a subgroup of the khoisan peoples the trend in cranial expansion and the acheulean elaboration of stone tool technologies which occurred between 400,000  years ago and the second interglacial period in the middle pleistocene  around 250,000  years ago  provide evidence for a transition from homo erectus to h  about 100,000  years ago  evidence of more sophisticated technology and artwork begins to emerge and by 50,000  years ago  fully modern behaviour becomes more stone tools show regular patterns that are reproduced or duplicated with more precision while tools made of bone and antler appear for the first of early homo sapiens were found in qafzeh cave in israel and have been dated to 80,000  to 100,000  years a fossil of a modern human dated to 54,700  years ago was found in manot cave in israel  named manot though the dating was questioned by groucutt et al  (2015).  fossils from lake mungo  australia  have been dated to about 42,000  years other fossils from a site called madjedbebe have been dated to at least 65,000  years man from china has a probable date range between 38,000  and 42,000  years ago  while liujiang man from the same region has a probable date range between 67,000  and 159,000  years ago  according to 2013  dna tests  tianyuan man is related  to many present-day  asians and native tianyuan is similar in morphology to minatogawa man  modern humans dated between 17,000  and 19,000  years ago and found on okinawa island  modern humans originated in africa by about 200,000  years ago  the accepted theory is that there were two dispersals from african an early one via northern africa which left traces in some human and a second one which populated the entire world the first dispersal took place between 130,000–115,000  years ago via northern africa  but died out or chinese researchers question this extinction  claiming that modern humans were present in china already 80,000  years second dispersal took place via the so-called  southern route  either or the toba event  which happened between 69,000  and 77,000  years this dispersal followed the southern coastline of asia  crossing about 250  kilometres (155  mi  of sea  and colonized australia by around 65,000-50,000  years ago  according to this theory  europe was populated either by a migration out of india  which was repopulated from southeast asia after the toba-event  (pre-toba  hypothesis   or by an early offshoot which settled the near east and europe (post-toba  in july 2017,  evidence suggests that homo sapiens may have migrated from africa as early as 270,000  years ago  much earlier than the 70,000  years ago thought early northern africa dispersal took place between 130,000–115,000  years ago the hypothesized departure of humankind from africa to colonise the rest of the world involved them crossing the straits of bab el mandab in the southern red sea and moving along the green coastlines around arabia and thence to the rest of eurasia  beginning 135,000  years ago  tropical africa experienced megadroughts which drove the humans from the land and towards the sea shores  and forced them to cross over to other continents  the researchers used radiocarbon dating techniques on pollen grains trapped in lake-bottom  mud to establish vegetation over the ages of the malawi lake in africa  taking samples at 300-year-intervals.  samples from the megadrought times had little pollen or charcoal  suggesting sparse vegetation with little to burn  the area around lake malawi  today heavily forested  was a desert approximately 135,000  to 90,000  years discovery of stone tools in the united arab emirates in 2011  indicated the presence of modern humans at least 100,000  and 125,000  years leading to a resurgence of the "long-neglected"  north african oman  a site was discovered by bien joven in 2011  containing more than 100  surface scatters of stone tools belonging to the late nubian complex  known previously only from archaeological excavations in the sudan  two optically stimulated luminescence age estimates place the arabian nubian complex at approximately 106,000  years old  this provides evidence for a distinct stone age technocomplex in southern arabia  around the earlier part of the marine isotope stage of early homo sapiens were found in qafzeh cave in israel and have been dated 80,000  to 100,000  years ago  these humans seem to have either become extinct or retreated back to africa 70,000  to 80,000  years ago  possibly replaced by southbound neanderthals escaping the colder regions of ice-age  hua liu et al  analyzed autosomal microsatellite markers dating to about 56,000  years ago  they interpret the paleontological fossil as an isolated early offshoot that retracted back to to kuhlwilm and his co-authors,  neanderthals contributed to modern humans genetically around 100,000  years ago  from humans which split off from other modern humans around 200,000  years they found that  the ancestors of neanderthals from the altai mountains and early modern humans met and interbred  possibly in the near east  many thousands of years earlier than previously according to co-author  ilan gronau   this actually complements archaeological evidence of the presence of early modern humans out of africa around and before 100  ka by providing the first genetic evidence of such similar genetic admixture events have been noted in other regions as well  china  the liujiang man  chinese  柳江人  is among the earliest modern humans found in east asia  liujiang man is a late pleistocene homo sapiens sapiens  the date most commonly attributed to the remains is 67,000  bp  high rates of variability yielded by various dating techniques carried out by different researchers place the most widely accepted range of dates with 67,000  bp as a minimum  but does not rule out dates as old as 159,000  liu  martinón-torres  et al  (2015)  claim that modern human teeth have been found in china dating to at least 80,000  years ago by some 70,000  years ago  a part of the bearers of mitochondrial haplogroup l3  migrated from east africa into the near east  it has been estimated that from a population of 2,000  to 5,000  individuals in africa  only a small group  possibly as few as 150  to 1,000  people  crossed the red the group that crossed the red sea travelled along the coastal route around arabia and persia to india  which appears to be the first major settling wells (2003)  argued for the route along the southern coastline of asia  across about 250  kilometres (155  mi   reaching australia by around 50,000  years ago today at the bab-el-mandeb  straits  the red sea is about 20  kilometres (12  mi  wide but 50,000  years ago sea levels were 70  m (230  ft  lower  owing to glaciation  and the water was much narrower  though the straits were never completely closed  they were narrow enough and there may have been islands in between to have enabled crossing using simple shell middens 125,000  years old have been found in indicating the diet of early humans included seafood obtained by beachcombing the dating of the southern dispersal is a matter of it may have happened either pre-  or post-toba,  a catastrophic volcanic eruption that took place between 69,000  and 77,000  years ago at the site of present-day  lake toba  stone tools discovered below the layers of ash disposed in india may point to a pre-toba  dispersal but the source of the tools is an indication for post-toba  is haplo-group  l3,  that originated before the dispersal of humans out of africa and can be dated to 60,000–70,000  years ago   suggesting that humanity left africa a few thousand years after new research showing slower than expected genetic mutations in human dna was published in 2012,  indicating a revised dating for the migration to between 90,000  and 130,000  years is thought that australia was colonised around 65,000-50,000  years ago  as of 2017,  the earliest evidence of humans in australia is at least 65,000  years while mcchesney stated that   genetic evidence suggests that a small band with the marker m168  migrated out of africa along the coasts of the arabian peninsula and india  through indonesia  and reached australia very early  between 60,000  and 50,000  years ago  this very early migration into australia is also supported by rasmussen et al  to meredith (2011),  members of one branch of homo sapiens left africa at some point between 125,000  and 60,000  years ago and replaced other populations of the genus homo such as neanderthals and homo erectus according to macaulay et al  (2005),  an early offshoot from the southern disposal with haplogroup n  followed the nile from east africa  heading northwards and crossing into asia through the sinai  this group then branched  some moving into europe and others heading east into this hypothesis is supported by the relatively late date of the arrival of modern humans in europe as well as by archaeological and dna based on an analysis of 55  human mitochondrial genomes  mtdnas  of hunter-gatherers,  posth et al  (2016)  argue for a  rapid single dispersal of all non-africans  less than 55,000  years ago  several authors have argued for multiple wells (2003)  describes two waves of migration  first the southern coastal route  then a northern migration into europe at circa 45,000  years 3]  this possibility is ruled out by macaulay et al  (2005)  and posth et al  (2016),  arguing for a single coastal dispersal  with an early offshoot into europe the first lineage to branch off from mitochondrial eve is l0.  this haplogroup is found in high proportions among the san of southern africa and the sandawe of east africa  it is also found among the mbuti these groups branched off early in human history and have remained relatively genetically isolated since then  haplogroups l1,  l2  and l3  are descendants of l1-6  and are largely confined to africa  the macro haplogroups m and n  which are the lineages of the rest of the world outside africa  descend from l3.  l3  is about 84,000  years old and haplogroup m and n are about 63,000  years the relationship between such gene trees and demographic history is still debated when applied to all the lineages present in africa  only the female descendants of one lineage  mtdna haplogroup l3,  are found outside africa  if there had been several migrations  one would expect descendants of more than one lineage to be found  l3's  female descendants  the m and n haplogroup lineages  are found in very low frequencies in africa  although haplogroup m1  populations are very ancient and diversified in north and north-east  africa  and appear to be more recent arrivals  a possible explanation is that these mutations occurred in east africa shortly before the exodus and became the dominant haplogroups after the departure through the founder effect  alternatively  the mutations may have arisen shortly afterwards results from mtdna collected from aboriginal malaysians called orang asli and the creation of a phylogentic tree indicate that the hapologroups m and n share characteristics with original african groups from approximately 85,000  years ago and share characteristics with sub-haplogroups  among coastal south-east  asian regions  such as australasia  the indian subcontinent and throughout continental asia  which had dispersed and separated from its african origins approximately 65,000  years ago  this southern coastal dispersion would have occurred before the dispersion through the levant approximately 45,000  years this hypothesis attempts to explain why haplogroup n is predominant in europe and why haplogroup m is absent in europe  evidence of the coastal migration is thought to have been destroyed by the rise in sea levels during the holocene alternatively  a small european founder population that had expressed haplogroup m and n at first  could have lost haplogroup m through random genetic drift resulting from a bottleneck  i e  a founder effect  the group that crossed the red sea travelled along the coastal route around arabia and persia until reaching haplogroup m is found in high frequencies along the southern coastal regions of pakistan and india and it has the greatest diversity in india  indicating that it is here where the mutation may have sixty percent of the indian population belong to haplogroup m  the indigenous people of the andaman islands also belong to the m lineage  the andamanese are thought to be offshoots of some of the earliest inhabitants in asia because of their long isolation from the mainland  they are evidence of the coastal route of early settlers that extends from india to thailand and indonesia all the way to papua new guinea  since m is found in high frequencies in highlanders from new guinea and the andamanese and new guineans have dark skin and afro-textured  hair  some scientists think they are all part of the same wave of migrants who departed across the red sea ~60,000  years ago in the great coastal migration  the proportion of haplogroup m increases eastwards from arabia to india  in eastern india  m outnumbers n by a ratio of 3:1.  crossing into southeast asia  haplogroup n  mostly in the form of derivatives of its r subclade  reappears as the predominant needed  m is predominant in east asia  but amongst indigenous australians  n is the more common needed  this haphazard distribution of haplogroup n from europe to australia can be explained by founder effects and population 2002  study of african  european and asian populations  found greater genetic diversity among africans than among eurasians  and that genetic diversity among eurasians is largely a subset of that among africans  supporting the out of africa a large study by coop et al  (2009)  found evidence for natural selection in autosomal dna outside of africa  the study distinguishes non-african  sweeps  notably kitlg variants associated with skin color   west-eurasian  sweeps (slc24a5)  and east-asian  sweeps (mc1r,  relevant to skin color   based on this evidence  the study concluded that human populations encountered novel selective pressures as they expanded out of mc1r  and its relation to skin color had already been discussed by liu  harding et al  (2000),  p  135.  according to this study  papua new guineans continued to be exposed to selection for dark skin color so that  although these groups are distinct from africans in other places  the allele for dark skin color shared by contemporary africans  andamanese and new guineans is an archaism  endicott et al  (2003)  suggest convergent evolution  a 2014  study by gurdasani et al  indicate that higher genetic diversity in africa was caused by relatively recent eurasian migrations into promising route towards reconstructing human genetic genealogy is via the jc virus  jcv   a type of human polyomavirus which is carried by 70–90  percent of humans and which is usually transmitted vertically  from parents to offspring  suggesting codivergence with human populations  for this reason  jcv has been used as a genetic marker for human evolution and this method does not appear to be reliable for the migration out of africa  in contrast to human genetics  jcv strains associated with african populations are not basal  from this shackelton et al  (2006)  conclude that either a basal african strain of jcv has become extinct or that the original infection with jcv post-dates  the migration from africa evidence for archaic human species  descended from homo heidelbergensis  having interbred with modern humans outside of africa  was discovered in the 2010s.  this concerns primarily neanderthal admixture in all modern populations except for sub-saharan  africans but evidence has also been presented for denisova hominin admixture in australasia  i e  in melanesians  aboriginal australians and some the rate of admixture has been found to be relatively low (1–10%),  and the result is still open to revision  as the presence of archaic markers has also been suggested as being due to shared ancestral traits rather than 2011,  evidence was presented for archaic admixture in some sub-saharan  african populations  biaka pygmies and san   derived from archaic hominins that broke away from the modern human lineage around 700,000  after a survey for the introgressive haplotypes across sub-saharan  populations  it was suggested that the admixture event happened with archaic hominins that possibly once inhabited central addition to genetic analysis  petraglia et al  also examines the small stone tools  microlithic materials  from indian subcontinent and explains the expansion of population based on the reconstruction of paleoenvironment  he proposed that the stone tools could be dated to 35  ka in south asia  and the new technology might be influenced by environmental change and population cladistic relationship of humans with the african apes was suggested by charles darwin after studying the behaviour of african apes  one of which was displayed at the london the anatomist thomas huxley had also supported the hypothesis and suggested that african apes have a close evolutionary relationship with these views were opposed by the german biologist ernst haeckel  who was a proponent of the out of asia theory  haeckel argued that humans were more closely related to the primates of south-east  asia and rejected darwin s african the descent of man  darwin speculated that humans had descended from apes  which still had small brains but walked upright  freeing their hands for uses which favoured intelligence  he thought such apes were african in each great region of the world the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region  it is  therefore  probable that africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee  and as these two species are now man s nearest allies  it is somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the african continent than elsewhere  but it is useless to speculate on this subject  for an ape nearly as large as a man  namely the dryopithecus of lartet  which was closely allied to the anthropomorphous hylobates  existed in europe during the upper miocene period  and since so remote a period the earth has certainly undergone many great revolutions  and there has been ample time for migration on the largest scale in 1871  there were hardly any human fossils of ancient hominins available  almost fifty years later  darwin s speculation was supported when anthropologists began finding fossils of ancient small-brained  hominins in several areas of africa  list of hominina fossils   the hypothesis of recent  as opposed to archaic  african origin developed in the 20th  century  the  recent african origin  of modern humans means  single origin   monogenism  and has been used in various contexts as an antonym to polygenism  the debate in anthropology had swung in favour of monogenism by the mid-20th  century  isolated proponents of polygenism held forth in the mid-20th  century  such as carleton coon  who thought as late as 1962  that h  sapiens arose five times from h  erectus in five historical alternative to the recent origin model is the multiregional origin of modern humans  initially proposed by milford wolpoff in the 1980s.  this view proposes that the derivation of anatomically modern human populations from h  erectus at the beginning of the pleistocene 1.8  million years bp  has taken place within a continuous world population  the hypothesis necessarily rejects the assumption of an infertility barrier between ancient eurasian and african populations of homo  the hypothesis was controversially debated during the late 1980s  and the the now-current  terminology of "recent-origin"  and  out of africa  became current in the context of this debate in the originally seen as an antithetical alternative to the recent origin model  the multiregional hypothesis in its original  strong  form is obsolete  while its various modified weaker variants have become variants of a view of  recent origin  combined with archaic stringer (2014)  distinguishes the original or  classic  multiregional model as having existed from 1984   its formulation  until 2003,  to a  weak  post-2003  variant that has  shifted close to that of the assimilation the 1980s,  allan wilson together with rebecca l  cann and mark stoneking worked on genetic dating of the matrilineal most recent common ancestor of modern human populations  dubbed  mitochondrial eve    to identify informative genetic markers for tracking human evolutionary history  wilson concentrated on mitochondrial dna  mtdna   passed from mother to child  this dna material mutates quickly  making it easy to plot changes over relatively short times  with his discovery that human mtdna is genetically much less diverse than chimpanzee mtdna  wilson concluded that modern human populations had diverged recently from a single population while older human species such as neanderthals and homo erectus had become with the advent of archaeogenetics in the 1990s,  the dating of mitochondrial and y-chromosomal  haplogroups became possible with some confidence  by 1999,  estimates ranged around 150,000  years for the mt-mrca  and 60,000  to 70,000  years for the migration out of 2000–2003,  there was controversy about the mitochondrial dna of  mungo man 3"  (lm3)  and its possible bearing on the multiregional hypothesis  lm3  was found to have more than the expected number of sequence differences when compared to modern human dna comparison of the mitochondrial dna with that of ancient and modern aborigines  led to the conclusion that mungo man fell outside the range of genetic variation seen in aboriginal australians and was used to support the multiregional origin hypothesis  a reanalysis on lm3  and other ancient specimens from the area published in 2016,  showed it to be akin to modern aboriginal australian sequences  inconsistent with the results of the earlier notescitationsbibliographyfurther reading
