 coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate structures secreted by corals  coral reefs are built by colonies of tiny animals found in marine water that contain few nutrients  most coral reefs are built from stony corals  which in turn consist of polyps that cluster in groups  the polyps belong to a group of animals known as cnidaria  which also includes sea anemones and jellyfish  unlike sea anemones  corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons which support and protect the coral polyps  most reefs grow best in warm  shallow  clear  sunny and agitated water often called  rainforests of the sea   shallow coral reefs form some of the most diverse ecosystems on earth  they occupy less than 0.1%  of the world s ocean surface  about half the area of france  yet they provide a home for at least 25%  of all marine including fish  mollusks  worms  crustaceans  echinoderms  sponges  tunicates and other paradoxically  coral reefs flourish even though they are surrounded by ocean waters that provide few nutrients  they are most commonly found at shallow depths in tropical waters  but deep water and cold water corals also exist on smaller scales in other areas coral reefs deliver ecosystem services to tourism  fisheries and shoreline protection  the annual global economic value of coral reefs is estimated between us$30–375  however  coral reefs are fragile ecosystems  partly because they are very sensitive to water temperature  they are under threat from climate change  oceanic acidification  blast fishing  cyanide fishing for aquarium fish  sunscreen overuse of reef resources  and harmful land-use  practices  including urban and agricultural runoff and water pollution  which can harm reefs by encouraging excess algal of the coral reefs we can see today were formed after the last glacial period when melting ice caused the sea level to rise and flood the continental shelves  this means that most modern coral reefs are less than 10,000  years old  as communities established themselves on the shelves  the reefs grew upwards  pacing rising sea levels  reefs that rose too slowly could become drowned reefs  they are covered by so much water that there was insufficient coral reefs are found in the deep sea away from continental shelves  around oceanic islands and as atolls  the vast majority of these islands are volcanic in origin  the few exceptions have tectonic origins where plate movements have lifted the deep ocean floor on the surface in 1842  in his first monograph  the structure and distribution of coral charles darwin set out his theory of the formation of atoll reefs  an idea he conceived during the voyage of the beagle  he theorized uplift and subsidence of the earth s crust under the oceans formed the darwin’s theory sets out a sequence of three stages in atoll formation  it starts with a fringing reef forming around an extinct volcanic island as the island and ocean floor subsides  as the subsidence continues  the fringing reef becomes a barrier reef  and ultimately an atoll reef darwin’s theory starts with a volcanic island which becomes extinctas the island and ocean floor subside  coral growth builds a fringing reef  often including a shallow lagoon between the land and the main reef as the subsidence continues  the fringing reef becomes a larger barrier reef further from the shore with a bigger and deeper lagoon inside ultimately  the island sinks below the sea  and the barrier reef becomes an atoll enclosing an open lagoon darwin predicted that underneath each lagoon would be a bed rock base  the remains of the original volcano  subsequent drilling proved this correct  darwin s theory followed from his understanding that coral polyps thrive in the clean seas of the tropics where the water is agitated  but can only live within a limited depth range  starting just below low tide  where the level of the underlying earth allows  the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs  and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a barrier reef where the bottom is rising  fringing reefs can grow around the coast  but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone  if the land subsides slowly  the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of older  dead coral  forming a barrier reef enclosing a lagoon between the reef and the land  a barrier reef can encircle an island  and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues to keep up with the sea level  forming a central lagoon  barrier reefs and atolls do not usually form complete circles  but are broken in places by storms  like sea level rise  a rapidly subsiding bottom can overwhelm coral growth  killing the coral polyps and the reef  due to what is called coral corals that rely on zooxanthellae can drown when the water becomes too deep for their symbionts to adequately photosynthesize  due to decreased light two main variables determining the geomorphology  or shape  of coral reefs are the nature of the underlying substrate on which they rest  and the history of the change in sea level relative to that substrate the approximately 20,000-year-old  great barrier reef offers an example of how coral reefs formed on continental shelves  sea level was then 120  m (390  ft  lower than in the 21st  as sea level rose  the water and the corals encroached on what had been hills of the australian coastal plain  by 13,000  years ago  sea level had risen to 60  m (200  ft  lower than at present  and many hills of the coastal plains had become continental islands  as the sea level rise continued  water topped most of the continental islands  the corals could then overgrow the hills  forming the present cays and reefs  sea level on the great barrier reef has not changed significantly in the last 6,000  and the age of the modern living reef structure is estimated to be between 6,000  and 8,000  although the great barrier reef formed along a continental shelf  and not around a volcanic island  darwin s principles apply  development stopped at the barrier reef stage  since australia is not about to submerge  it formed the world s largest barrier reef  300–1,000  m (980–3,280  ft  from shore  stretching for 2,000  km (1,200  tropical coral reefs grow horizontally from 1  to 3  cm (0.39  to 1.18  in  per year  and grow vertically anywhere from 1  to 25  cm (0.39  to 9.84  in  per year  however  they grow only at depths shallower than 150  m (490  ft  because of their need for sunlight  and cannot grow above sea the name implies  the bulk of coral reefs is made up of coral skeletons from mostly intact coral colonies  as other chemical elements present in corals become incorporated into the calcium carbonate deposits  aragonite is formed  however  shell fragments and the remains of calcareous algae such as the green-segmented  genus halimeda can add to the reef s ability to withstand damage from storms and other threats  such mixtures are visible in structures such as eniwetok three principal reef types are other reef types or variants are coral reef ecosystems contain distinct zones that represent different kinds of habitats  usually  three major zones are recognized  the fore reef  reef crest  and the back reef  frequently referred to as the reef lagoon  all three zones are physically and ecologically interconnected  reef life and oceanic processes create opportunities for exchange of seawater  sediments  nutrients  and marine life among one another thus  they are integrated components of the coral reef ecosystem  each playing a role in the support of the reefs  abundant and diverse fish assemblages most coral reefs exist in shallow waters less than 50  m deep  some inhabit tropical continental shelves where cool  nutrient rich upwelling does not occur  such as great barrier reef  others are found in the deep ocean surrounding islands or as atolls  such as in the maldives  the reefs surrounding islands form when islands subside into the ocean  and atolls form when an island subsides below the surface of the sea alternatively  moyle and cech distinguish six zones  though most reefs possess only some of the reef surface is the shallowest part of the reef  it is subject to the surge and the rise and fall of tides  when waves pass over shallow areas  they shoal  as shown in the diagram at the right  this means the water is often agitated  these are the precise condition under which corals flourish  shallowness means there is plenty of light for photosynthesis by the symbiotic zooxanthellae  and agitated water promotes the ability of coral to feed on plankton  however  other organisms must be able to withstand the robust conditions to flourish in this zone the off-reef  floor is the shallow sea floor surrounding a reef  this zone occurs by reefs on continental shelves  reefs around tropical islands and atolls drop abruptly to great depths  and do not have a floor  usually sandy  the floor often supports seagrass meadows which are important foraging areas for reef fish the reef drop-off  is  for its first 50  m  habitat for many reef fish who find shelter on the cliff face and plankton in the water nearby  the drop-off  zone applies mainly to the reefs surrounding oceanic islands and atolls the reef face is the zone above the reef floor or the reef drop-off.  this zone is often the most diverse area of the reef  coral and calcareous algae growths provide complex habitats and areas which offer protection  such as cracks and crevices  invertebrates and epiphytic algae provide much of the food for other a common feature on this forereef zone is spur and groove formations which serve to transport sediment downslope the reef flat is the sandy-bottomed  flat  which can be behind the main reef  containing chunks of coral  this zone may border a lagoon and serve as a protective area  or it may lie between the reef and the shore  and in this case is a flat  rocky area  fishes tend to prefer living in that flat  rocky area  compared to any other zone  when it is reef lagoon is an entirely enclosed region  which creates an area less affected by wave action that often contains small reef the  topography of coral reefs is constantly changing  each reef is made up of irregular patches of algae  sessile invertebrates  and bare rock and sand  the size  shape and relative abundance of these patches changes from year to year in response to the various factors that favor one type of patch over another  growing coral  for example  produces constant change in the fine structure of reefs  on a larger scale  tropical storms may knock out large sections of reef and cause boulders on sandy areas to reefs are estimated to cover 284,300  km2  (109,800  sq just under 0.1%  of the oceans  surface area  the indo-pacific  region  including the red sea  indian ocean  southeast asia and the pacific  account for 91.9%  of this total  southeast asia accounts for 32.3%  of that figure  while the pacific including australia accounts for 40.8%.  atlantic and caribbean coral reefs account for corals exist both in temperate and tropical waters  shallow-water  reefs form only in a zone extending from approximately 30°  n to 30°  s of the equator  tropical corals do not grow at depths of over 50  meters (160  ft   the optimum temperature for most coral reefs is 26–27  °c (79–81  °f   and few reefs exist in waters below 18  °c (64  however  reefs in the persian gulf have adapted to temperatures of 13  °c (55  °f  in winter and 38  °c (100  °f  in there are 37  species of scleractinian corals identified in such harsh environment around larak coral can exist at greater depths and colder temperatures at much higher latitudes  as far north as although deep water corals can form reefs  very little is known about them coral reefs are rare along the west coasts of the americas and africa  due primarily to upwelling and strong cold coastal currents that reduce water temperatures in these areas  respectively the peru  benguela and canary corals are seldom found along the coastline of south asia—from the eastern tip of india  chennai  to the bangladesh and myanmar well as along the coasts of northeastern south america and bangladesh  due to the freshwater release from the amazon and ganges rivers respectively alive corals are colonies of small animals embedded in calcium carbonate shells  it is a mistake to think of coral as plants or rocks  coral heads consist of accumulations of individual animals called polyps  arranged in diverse polyps are usually tiny  but they can range in size from a pinhead to 12  inches (30  cm  across.reef-building  or hermatypic corals live only in the photic zone  above 50  m   the depth to which sufficient sunlight penetrates the water  allowing photosynthesis to occur  coral polyps do not photosynthesize  but have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae of the genus symbiodinium  commonly referred to as zooxanthellae  these organisms live within the tissues of polyps and provide organic nutrients that nourish the polyp  because of this relationship  coral reefs grow much faster in clear water  which admits more sunlight  without their symbionts  coral growth would be too slow to form significant reef structures  corals get up to 90%  of their nutrients from their grow as polyps and other organisms deposit calcium the basis of coral  as a skeletal structure beneath and around themselves  pushing the coral head s top upwards and waves  grazing fish  such as parrotfish   sea urchins  sponges  and other forces and organisms act as bioeroders  breaking down coral skeletons into fragments that settle into spaces in the reef structure or form sandy bottoms in associated reef lagoons  many other organisms living in the reef community contribute skeletal calcium carbonate in the same coralline algae are important contributors to reef structure in those parts of the reef subjected to the greatest forces by waves  such as the reef front facing the open ocean   these algae strengthen the reef structure by depositing limestone in sheets over the reef surface typical shapes for coral species are wrinkled brains  cabbages  table tops  antlers  wire strands and pillars  these shapes can depend on the life history of the coral  like light exposure and wave and events such as reproduce both sexually and asexually  an individual polyp uses both reproductive modes within its lifetime  corals reproduce sexually by either internal or external fertilization  the reproductive cells are found on the mesenteries  membranes that radiate inward from the layer of tissue that lines the stomach cavity  some mature adult corals are hermaphroditic  others are exclusively male or female  a few species change sex as they grow internally fertilized eggs develop in the polyp for a period ranging from days to weeks  subsequent development produces a tiny larva  known as a planula  externally fertilized eggs develop during synchronized spawning  polyps release eggs and sperm into the water en masse  simultaneously  eggs disperse over a large area  the timing of spawning depends on time of year  water temperature  and tidal and lunar cycles  spawning is most successful when there is little variation between high and low tide  the less water movement  the better the chance for fertilization  ideal timing occurs in the spring  release of eggs or planula usually occurs at night  and is sometimes in phase with the lunar cycle  three to six days after a full moon   the period from release to settlement lasts only a few days  but some planulae can survive afloat for several weeks  they are vulnerable to predation and environmental conditions  the lucky few planulae which successfully attach to substrate next confront competition for food and needed there are eight clades of symbiodinium phylotypes  most research has been completed on the symbiodinium clades a–d  each one of the eight contributes their own benefits as well as less compatible attributes to the survival of their coral hosts  each photosynthetic organism has a specific level of sensitivity to photodamage of compounds needed for survival  such as proteins  rates of regeneration and replication determine the organism s ability to survive  phylotype a is found more in the shallow regions of marine waters  it is able to produce mycosporine-like  amino acids that are uv resistant  using a derivative of glycerin to absorb the uv radiation and allowing them to become more receptive to warmer water temperatures  in the event of uv or thermal damage  if and when repair occurs  it will increase the likelihood of survival of the host and symbiont  this leads to the idea that  evolutionarily  clade a is more uv resistant and thermally resistant than the other b and c are found more frequently in the deeper water regions  which may explain the higher susceptibility to increased temperatures  terrestrial plants that receive less sunlight because they are found in the undergrowth can be analogized to clades b  c  and d  since clades b through d are found at deeper depths  they require an elevated light absorption rate to be able to synthesize as much energy  with elevated absorption rates at uv wavelengths  the deeper occurring phylotypes are more prone to coral bleaching versus the more shallow clades  clade d has been observed to be high temperature-tolerant,  and as a result it has a higher rate of survival than clades b and coralstaghorn coralspiral wire coralpillar coralmushroom coralmaze coralblack coralfluorescent oceanographic research has brought to light the reality of this paradox by confirming that the oligotrophy of the ocean euphotic zone persists right up to the swell-battered  reef crest  when you approach the reef edges and atolls from the quasidesert of the open sea  the near absence of living matter suddenly becomes a plethora of life  without transition  so why is there something rather than nothing  and more precisely  where do the necessary nutrients for the functioning of this extraordinary coral reef machine come from  in the structure and distribution of coral reefs  published in 1842,  darwin described how coral reefs were found in some areas of the tropical seas but not others  with no obvious cause  the largest and strongest corals grew in parts of the reef exposed to the most violent surf and corals were weakened or absent where loose sediment waters contain few yet a coral reef can flourish like an  oasis in the this has given rise to the ecosystem conundrum  sometimes called  darwin s paradox    how can such high production flourish in such nutrient poor reefs cover less than 0.1%  of the surface of the world’s ocean  about half the land area of france  yet they support over one-quarter  of all marine species  this diversity results in complex food webs  with large predator fish eating smaller forage fish that eat yet smaller zooplankton and so on  however  all food webs eventually depend on plants  which are the primary producers  coral reefs  primary productivity is very high  typically producing 5–10  grams of carbon per square meter per day (gc·m−2·day−1)  reason for the unusual clarity of tropical waters is they are deficient in nutrients and drifting plankton  further  the sun shines year-round  in the tropics  warming the surface layer  making it less dense than subsurface layers  the warmer water is separated from deeper  cooler water by a stable thermocline  where the temperature makes a rapid change  this keeps the warm surface waters floating above the cooler deeper waters  in most parts of the ocean  there is little exchange between these layers  organisms that die in aquatic environments generally sink to the bottom  where they decompose  which releases nutrients in the form of nitrogen  n   phosphorus  p  and potassium  k   these nutrients are necessary for plant growth  but in the tropics  they do not directly return to the needed plants form the base of the food chain  and need sunlight and nutrients to grow  in the ocean  these plants are mainly microscopic phytoplankton which drift in the water column  they need sunlight for photosynthesis  which powers carbon fixation  so they are found only relatively near the surface  but they also need nutrients  phytoplankton rapidly use nutrients in the surface waters  and in the tropics  these nutrients are not usually replaced because of the needed around coral reefs  lagoons fill in with material eroded from the reef and the island  they become havens for marine life  providing protection from waves and storms most importantly  reefs recycle nutrients  which happens much less in the open ocean  in coral reefs and lagoons  producers include phytoplankton  as well as seaweed and coralline algae  especially small types called turf algae  which pass nutrients to the phytoplankton are eaten by fish and crustaceans  who also pass nutrients along the food web  recycling ensures fewer nutrients are needed overall to support the community coral reefs support many symbiotic relationships  in particular  zooxanthellae provide energy to coral in the form of glucose  glycerol  and amino zooxanthellae can provide up to 90%  of a coral’s energy in return  as an example of mutualism  the corals shelter the zooxanthellae  averaging one million for every cubic centimeter of coral  and provide a constant supply of the carbon dioxide they need for photosynthesis corals also absorb nutrients  including inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus  directly from water  many corals extend their tentacles at night to catch zooplankton that brush them when the water is agitated  zooplankton provide the polyp with nitrogen  and the polyp shares some of the nitrogen with the zooxanthellae  which also require this the varying pigments in different species of zooxanthellae give them an overall brown or golden-brown  appearance  and give brown corals their colors  other pigments such as reds  blues  greens  etc  come from colored proteins made by the coral animals  coral which loses a large fraction of its zooxanthellae becomes white  or sometimes pastel shades in corals that are richly pigmented with their own colorful proteins  and is said to be bleached  a condition which  unless corrected  can kill the coral sponges are another key  they live in crevices in the coral reefs  they are efficient filter feeders  and in the red sea they consume about 60%  of the phytoplankton that drifts by  the sponges eventually excrete nutrients in a form the corals can roughness of coral surfaces is the key to coral survival in agitated waters  normally  a boundary layer of still water surrounds a submerged object  which acts as a barrier  waves breaking on the extremely rough edges of corals disrupt the boundary layer  allowing the corals access to passing nutrients  turbulent water thereby promotes reef growth and branching  without the nutritional gains brought by rough coral surfaces  even the most effective recycling would leave corals wanting in have shown that deep nutrient-rich  water entering coral reefs through isolated events may have significant effects on temperature and nutrient this water movement disrupts the relatively stable thermocline that usually exists between warm shallow water to deeper colder water  leichter et al  found that temperature regimes on coral reefs in the bahamas and florida were highly variable with temporal scales of minutes to seasons and spatial scales across depths water can be moved through coral reefs in various ways  including current rings  surface waves  internal waves and tidal movement is generally created by tides and wind  as tides interact with varying bathymetry and wind mixes with surface water  internal waves are created  an internal wave is a gravity wave that moves along density stratification within the ocean  when a water parcel encounters a different density it will oscillate and create internal while internal waves generally have a lower frequency than surface waves  they often form as a single wave that breaks into multiple waves as it hits a slope and moves this vertical break up of internal waves causes significant diapycnal mixing and internal waves can act as nutrient pumps  bringing plankton and cool nutrient-rich  water up to the irregular structure characteristic of coral reef bathymetry may enhance mixing and produce pockets of cooler water and variable nutrient arrival of cool  nutrient-rich  water from depths due to internal waves and tidal bores has been linked to growth rates of suspension feeders and benthic as well as plankton and larval leichter et proposed that the seaweed codium isthmocladum reacts to deep water nutrient sources due to their tissues having different concentrations of nutrients dependent upon depth  wolanski and noted aggregations of eggs  larval organisms and plankton on reefs in response to deep water intrusions  similarly  as internal waves and bores move vertically  surface-dwelling  larval organisms are carried toward the this has significant biological importance to cascading effects of food chains in coral reef ecosystems and may provide yet another key to unlocking  darwin s paradox  cyanobacteria provide soluble nitrates for the reef via nitrogen reefs also often depend on surrounding habitats  such as seagrass meadows and mangrove forests  for nutrients  seagrass and mangroves supply dead plants and animals which are rich in nitrogen and also serve to feed fish and animals from the reef by supplying wood and vegetation  reefs  in turn  protect mangroves and seagrass from waves and produce sediment in which the mangroves and seagrass can reefs form some of the world s most productive ecosystems  providing complex and varied marine habitats that support a wide range of other reefs just below low tide level have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high tide level and sea grass meadows in between  the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted  while the mangroves and sea grass protect the coral from large influxes of silt  fresh water and pollutants  this level of variety in the environment benefits many coral reef animals  which  for example  may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or are home to a large variety of animals  including fish  seabirds  sponges  cnidarians  which includes some types of corals and jellyfish   worms  crustaceans  including shrimp  cleaner shrimp  spiny lobsters and crabs   mollusks  including cephalopods   echinoderms  including starfish  sea urchins and sea cucumbers   sea squirts  sea turtles and sea snakes  aside from humans  mammals are rare on coral reefs  with visiting cetaceans such as dolphins being the main exception  a few of these varied species feed directly on corals  while others graze on algae on the reef biomass is positively related to species same hideouts in a reef may be regularly inhabited by different species at different times of day  nighttime predators such as cardinalfish and squirrelfish hide during the day  while damselfish  surgeonfish  triggerfish  wrasses and parrotfish hide from eels and are chronically at risk of algal encroachment  overfishing and excess nutrient supply from onshore can enable algae to outcompete and kill the increased nutrient levels can be a result of sewage or chemical fertilizer runoff from nearby coastal developments  runoff can carry nitrogen and phosphorus which promote excess algae growth  algae can sometimes out-compete  the coral for space  the algae can then smother the coral by decreasing the oxygen supply available to the reef  decreased oxygen levels can slow down coral s calcification rates weakening the coral and leaving it more susceptible to disease and in surveys done around largely uninhabited us pacific islands  algae inhabit a large percentage of surveyed coral the algal population consists of turf algae  coralline algae  and macro algae sponges are essential for the functioning of the coral reef s ecosystem  algae and corals in coral reefs produce organic material  this is filtered through sponges which convert this organic material into small particles which in turn are absorbed by algae and 4,000  species of fish inhabit coral the reasons for this diversity remain unclear  hypotheses include the  lottery   in which the first  lucky winner  recruit to a territory is typically able to defend it against latecomers   competition   in which adults compete for territory  and less-competitive  species must be able to survive in poorer habitat  and  predation   in which population size is a function of postsettlement piscivore healthy reefs can produce up to 35  tons of fish per square kilometer each year  but damaged reefs produce much urchins  dotidae and sea slugs eat seaweed  some species of sea urchins  such as diadema antillarum  can play a pivotal part in preventing algae from overrunning nudibranchia and sea anemones eat sponges a number of invertebrates  collectively called  cryptofauna   inhabit the coral skeletal substrate itself  either boring into the skeletons  through the process of bioerosion  or living in pre-existing  voids and crevices  those animals boring into the rock include sponges  bivalve mollusks  and sipunculans  those settling on the reef include many other species  particularly crustaceans and polychaete reef systems provide important habitats for seabird species  some endangered  for example  midway atoll in hawaii supports nearly three million seabirds  including two-thirds  (1.5  million  of the global population of laysan albatross  and one-third  of the global population of black-footed  each seabird species has specific sites on the atoll where they nest  altogether  17  species of seabirds live on midway  the short-tailed  albatross is the rarest  with fewer than 2,200  surviving after excessive feather hunting in the late 19th  snakes feed exclusively on fish and their marine birds  such as herons  gannets  pelicans and boobies  feed on reef fish  some land-based  reptiles intermittently associate with reefs  such as monitor lizards  the marine crocodile and semiaquatic snakes  such as laticauda

the value of reef and mangrove services at $395–559  million coral reefs provide economic benefits to the island worth on average $722  million per year  based on six key ecosystem services  according to sarkis et al reefs are dying around the in particular  coral mining  agricultural and urban runoff  pollution  organic and inorganic   overfishing  blast fishing  disease  and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems  broader threats are sea temperature rise  sea level rise and ph changes from ocean acidification  all associated with greenhouse gas emissions  a 2014  study lists factors such as population explosion along the coast lines  overfishing  the pollution of coastal areas  global warming and invasive species among the main reasons that have put reefs in danger of study released in april 2013  has shown that air pollution can also stunt the growth of coral reefs  researchers from australia  panama and the uk used coral records  between 1880  and 2000)  from the western caribbean to show the threat of factors such as coal-burning  coal and volcanic pollutants  such as tributyltin  a biocide released into water from in anti-fouling  paint can be toxic to corals in 2011,  researchers suggested that  extant marine invertebrates face the same synergistic effects of multiple stressors  that occurred during the end-permian  extinction  and that genera  with poorly buffered respiratory physiology and calcareous shells   such as corals  were particularly coral on seamounts across the ocean are under fire from bottom trawling  reportedly up to 50%  of the catch is rock coral  and the practice transforms coral structures to rubble  with it taking years to regrow  these coral communities are disappearing faster than they can sustain cause for the death of coral reefs is bioerosion  various fishes graze corals  dead or alive and change the morphology of coral reefs making them more susceptible to other physical and chemical threats  it has been generally observed that only the algae growing on dead corals is eaten and the live ones are not  however  this act still destroys the top layer of coral substrate and makes it harder for the reefs to el niño-year  2010,  preliminary reports show global coral bleaching reached its worst level since another el niño year  1998,  when 16%  of the world s reefs died as a result of increased water temperature  in indonesia s aceh province  surveys showed some 80%  of bleached corals died  scientists do not yet understand the long-term  impacts of coral bleaching  but they do know that bleaching leaves corals vulnerable to disease  stunts their growth  and affects their reproduction  while severe bleaching kills in july  malaysia closed several dive sites where virtually all the corals were damaged by find answers for these problems  researchers study the various factors that impact reefs  the list includes the ocean s role as a carbon dioxide sink  atmospheric changes  ultraviolet light  ocean acidification  viruses  impacts of dust storms carrying agents to far-flung  reefs  pollutants  algal blooms and others  reefs are threatened well beyond coastal needed  coral reefs with one type of zooxanthellae are more prone to bleaching than are reefs with another  more hardy  estimates show approximately 10%  of the world s coral reefs are about 60%  of the world s reefs are at risk due to destructive  human-related  activities  the threat to the health of reefs is particularly high in southeast asia  where 95%  of reefs are at risk from local by the 2030s,  90%  of reefs are expected to be at risk from both human activities and climate change  by 2050,  all coral reefs will be in research is showing that ecotourism in the great barrier reef is contributing to coral and that chemicals in sunscreens may contribute to the impact of viruses on scientists  including those associated with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  posit that us coral reefs are likely to disappear within a few decades as a result of global protected areas  mpas  have become increasingly prominent for reef management  mpas promote responsible fishery management and habitat protection  much like national parks and wildlife refuges  and to varying degrees  mpas restrict potentially damaging activities  mpas encompass both social and biological objectives  including reef restoration  aesthetics  biodiversity  and economic benefits  however  there are very few mpas that have actually made a substantial difference  research in indonesia  philippines and papua new guinea shows that there is no significant difference between an mpa site and an unprotected conflicts surrounding mpas involve lack of participation  clashing views of the government and fisheries  effectiveness of the area  and in some situations  as in the phoenix islands protected area  mpas can also provide revenue  potentially equal to the income they would have generated without controls  as kiribati did for its phoenix to the caribbean coral reefs -  status report 1970-2012  made by the iucn  states that  stopping overfishing especially key

controlling pollution specially sewage wastage  may not only reduce coral declining but also reverse it and may let to coral reef more adaptable to changes relates to climate and acidification  the

 resilient help combat ocean acidification  some laws are in place to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide  the clean water act puts pressure on state government agencies to monitor and limit runoff of pollutants that can cause ocean acidification  stormwater surge preventions are also in place  as well as coastal buffers between agricultural land and the coastline  this act also ensures that delicate watershed ecosystems are intact  such as wetlands  the clean water act is funded by the federal government  and is monitored by various watershed groups  many land use laws aim to reduce co2  emissions by limiting deforestation  deforestation causes erosion  which releases a large amount of carbon stored in the soil  which then flows into the ocean  contributing to ocean acidification  incentives are used to reduce miles traveled by vehicles  which reduces the carbon emissions into the atmosphere  thereby reducing the amount of dissolved co2  in the ocean  state and federal governments also control coastal erosion  which releases stored carbon in the soil into the ocean  increasing ocean high-end  satellite technology is increasingly being employed to monitor coral reef reserve  marine park  national monument and world heritage status can protect reefs  for example  belize s barrier reef  sian ka an  the galapagos islands  great barrier reef  henderson island  palau and papahānaumokuākea marine national monument are world heritage australia  the great barrier reef is protected by the great barrier reef marine park authority  and is the subject of much legislation  including a biodiversity action they have compiled a coral reef resilience action plan  this detailed action plan consists of numerous adaptive management strategies  including reducing our carbon footprint  which would ultimately reduce the amount of ocean acidification in the oceans surrounding the great barrier reef  an extensive public awareness plan is also in place to provide education on the “rainforests of the sea” and how people can reduce carbon emissions  thereby reducing ocean of ahus island  manus province  papua new guinea  have followed a generations-old  practice of restricting fishing in six areas of their reef lagoon  their cultural traditions allow line fishing  but no net or spear fishing  the result is both the biomass and individual fish sizes are significantly larger than in places where fishing is aquaculture  also known as coral farming or coral gardening  is showing promise as a potentially effective tool for restoring coral reefs  which have been declining around the the process bypasses the early growth stages of corals when they are most at risk of dying  coral seeds are grown in nurseries  then replanted on the coral is farmed by coral farmers who live locally to the reefs and farm for reef conservation or for income efforts to expand the size and number of coral reefs generally involve supplying substrate to allow more corals to find a home  substrate materials include discarded vehicle tires  scuttled ships  subway cars  and formed concrete  such as reef balls  reefs also grow unaided on marine structures such as oil needed  in large restoration projects  propagated hermatypic coral on substrate can be secured with metal pins  superglue or needle and thread can also attach a-hermatype  coral to substrate for growing corals referred to as biorock is produced by running low voltage electrical currents through seawater to crystallize dissolved minerals onto steel structures  the resultant white carbonate  aragonite  is the same mineral that makes up natural coral reefs  corals rapidly colonize and grow at accelerated rates on these coated structures  the electrical currents also accelerate formation and growth of both chemical limestone rock and the skeletons of corals and other shell-bearing  organisms  the vicinity of the anode and cathode provides a high-ph  environment which inhibits the growth of competitive filamentous and fleshy algae  the increased growth rates fully depend on the accretion accretion  the settled corals display an increased growth rate  size and density  but after the process is complete  growth rate and density return to levels comparable to natural growth  and are about the same size or slightly case study with coral reef restoration was conducted on the island of oahu in hawaii  the university of hawaii has come up with a coral reef assessment and monitoring program to help relocate and restore coral reefs in hawaii  a boat channel on the island of oahu to the hawaii institute of marine biology was overcrowded with coral reefs  also  many areas of coral reef patches in the channel had been damaged from past dredging in the channel  dredging covers the existing corals with sand  and their larvae cannot build and thrive on sand  they can only build on to existing reefs  because of this  the university of hawaii decided to relocate some of the coral reef to a different transplant site  they transplanted them with the help of the united states army divers  to a relocation site relatively close to the channel  they observed very little  if any  damage occurred to any of the colonies while they were being transported  and no mortality of coral reefs has been observed on the new transplant site  but they will be continuing to monitor the new transplant site to see how potential environmental impacts  i e  ocean acidification  will harm the overall reef mortality rate  while trying to attach the coral to the new transplant site  they found the coral placed on hard rock is growing considerably well  and coral was even growing on the wires that attached the transplant corals to the transplant site  this gives new hope to future research on coral reef transplant sites  as a result of this coral restoration project  no environmental effects were seen from the transplantation process  no recreational activities were decreased  and no scenic areas were affected by the project  this is a great example that coral transplantation and restoration can work and thrive under the right conditions  which means there may be hope for other damaged coral possibility for coral restoration is gene therapy  through infecting coral with genetically modified bacteria  it may be possible to grow corals that are more resistant to climate change and other earth history  from a few thousand years after hard skeletons were developed by marine organisms  there were almost always reefs  the times of maximum development were in the middle cambrian (513–501  ma   devonian (416–359  ma  and carboniferous (359–299  ma   owing to order rugosa extinct corals  and late cretaceous (100–66  ma  and all neogene (23  ma–present   owing to order scleractinia corals not all reefs in the past were formed by corals  those in the early cambrian (542–513  ma  resulted from calcareous algae and archaeocyathids  small animals with conical shape  probably related to sponges  and in the late cretaceous (100–66  ma   when there also existed reefs formed by a group of bivalves called rudists  one of the valves formed the main conical structure and the other  much smaller valve acted as a cap measurements of the oxygen isotopic composition of the aragonitic skeleton of coral reefs  such as porites  can indicate changes in the sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity conditions of the ocean during the growth of the coral  this technique is often used by climate scientists to infer the paleoclimate of a
