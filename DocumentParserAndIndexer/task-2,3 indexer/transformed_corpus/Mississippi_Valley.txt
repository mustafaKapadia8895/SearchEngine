 the mississippi river is the chief river of the second-largest  drainage system on the north american continent  second only to the hudson bay drainage flowing entirely in the united states  although its drainage basin reaches into canada   it rises in northern minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for 2,320  miles (3,730  to the mississippi river delta at the gulf of mexico  with its many tributaries  the mississippi s watershed drains all or parts of 31  u s  states and 2  canadian provinces between the rocky and appalachian mountains  the mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest  and fifteenth-largest  river in the world by discharge  the river either borders or passes through the states of minnesota  wisconsin  iowa  illinois  missouri  kentucky  tennessee  arkansas  mississippi  and americans long lived along the mississippi river and its tributaries  most were hunter-gatherers,  but some  such as the mound builders  formed prolific agricultural societies  the arrival of europeans in the 16th  century changed the native way of life as first explorers  then settlers  ventured into the basin in increasing the river served first as a barrier  forming borders for new spain  new france  and the early united states  and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link  in the 19th  century  during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny  the mississippi and several western tributaries  most notably the missouri  formed pathways for the western expansion of the united states formed from thick layers of the river s silt deposits  the mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile agricultural regions of the country  which resulted in the river s storied steamboat era  during the american civil war  the mississippi s capture by union forces marked a turning point towards victory due to the river s importance as a route of trade and travel  not least to the confederacy  because of substantial growth of cities and the larger ships and barges that supplanted riverboats  the first decades of the 20th  century saw the construction of massive engineering works such as levees  locks and dams  often built in combination since modern development of the basin began  the mississippi has also seen its share of pollution and environmental problems – most notably large volumes of agricultural runoff  which has led to the gulf of mexico dead zone off the delta  in recent years  the river has shown a steady shift towards the atchafalaya river channel in the delta  a course change would be an economic disaster for the port city of new orleans the word itself comes from messipi  the french rendering of the anishinaabe  ojibwe or algonquin  name for the river  misi-ziibi   great river  in the 18th  century  the river was the primary western boundary of the young united states  and since the country s expansion westward  the mississippi river has been widely considered a convenient if approximate dividing line between the eastern  southern  and midwestern united states  and the western united states  this is exemplified by the gateway arch in st  louis and the phrase "trans-mississippi"  as used in the name of the trans-mississippi  exposition it is common to qualify a regionally superlative landmark in relation to it  such as  the highest peak east of the or  the oldest city west of the the fcc also uses it as the dividing line for broadcast callsigns  which begin with w to the east and k to the west  mixing together in media markets along the river the geographical setting of the mississippi river includes considerations of the course of the river itself  its watershed  its outflow  its prehistoric and historic course changes  and possibilities of future course changes  the new madrid seismic zone along the river is also noteworthy  these various basic geographical aspects of the river in turn underlie its human history and present uses of the waterway and its adjacent lands the mississippi river can be divided into three sections  the upper mississippi  the river from its headwaters to the confluence with the missouri river  the middle mississippi  which is downriver from the missouri to the ohio river  and the lower mississippi  which flows from the ohio to the gulf of mexico the upper mississippi runs from its headwaters to its confluence with the missouri river at st  louis  missouri  it is divided into two sections the source of the upper mississippi branch is traditionally accepted as lake itasca  1,475  feet (450  m  above sea level in itasca state park in clearwater county  minnesota  the name  itasca  was chosen to designate the  true head  of the mississippi river as a combination of the last four letters of the latin word for truth  veritas  and the first two letters of the latin word for head however  the lake is in turn fed by a number of smaller streams from its origin at lake itasca to st  louis  missouri  the waterway s flow is moderated by 43  dams  fourteen of these dams are located above minneapolis in the headwaters region and serve multiple purposes  including power generation and recreation  the remaining 29  dams  beginning in downtown minneapolis  all contain locks and were constructed to improve commercial navigation of the upper river  taken as a whole  these 43  dams significantly shape the geography and influence the ecology of the upper river  beginning just below saint paul  minnesota  and continuing throughout the upper and lower river  the mississippi is further controlled by thousands of wing dikes that moderate the river s flow in order to maintain an open navigation channel and prevent the river from eroding its banks the head of navigation on the mississippi is the coon rapids dam in coon rapids  minnesota  before it was built in 1913,  steamboats could occasionally go upstream as far as saint cloud  minnesota  depending on river conditions the uppermost lock and dam on the upper mississippi river is the upper st  anthony falls lock and dam in minneapolis  above the dam  the river s elevation is 799  feet (244  m   below the dam  the river s elevation is 750  feet (230  m   this 49-foot  (15  m  drop is the largest of all the mississippi river locks and dams  the origin of the dramatic drop is a waterfall preserved adjacent to the lock under an apron of concrete  saint anthony falls is the only true waterfall on the entire mississippi river  the water elevation continues to drop steeply as it passes through the gorge carved by the waterfall after the completion of the st  anthony falls lock and dam in 1963,  the river s head of navigation moved upstream  to the coon rapids dam  however  the locks were closed in 2015  to control the spread of invasive asian carp  making minneapolis once again the site of the head of navigation of the upper mississippi has a number of natural and artificial lakes  with its widest point being lake winnibigoshish  near grand rapids  minnesota  over 11  miles (18  km  across  lake onalaska  created by lock and dam no  7,  near la crosse  wisconsin  is more than 4  miles (6.4  km  wide  lake pepin  a natural lake formed behind the delta of the chippewa river of wisconsin as it enters the upper mississippi  is more than 2  miles (3.2  km  the time the upper mississippi reaches saint paul  minnesota  below lock and dam no  1,  it has dropped more than half its original elevation and is 687  feet (209  m  above sea level  from st  paul to st  louis  missouri  the river elevation falls much more slowly  and is controlled and managed as a series of pools created by 26  locks and upper mississippi river is joined by the minnesota river at fort snelling in the twin cities  the st  croix river near prescott  wisconsin  the cannon river near red wing  minnesota  the zumbro river at wabasha  minnesota  the black  la crosse  and root rivers in la crosse  wisconsin  the wisconsin river at prairie du chien  wisconsin  the rock river at the quad cities  the iowa river near wapello  iowa  the skunk river south of burlington  iowa  and the des moines river at keokuk  iowa  other major tributaries of the upper mississippi include the crow river in minnesota  the chippewa river in wisconsin  the maquoketa river and the wapsipinicon river in iowa  and the illinois river in illinois the upper mississippi is largely a multi-thread  stream with many bars and islands  from its confluence with the st  croix river downstream to dubuque  iowa  the river is entrenched  with high bedrock bluffs lying on either side  the height of these bluffs decreases to the south of dubuque  though they are still significant through savanna  illinois  this topography contrasts strongly with the lower mississippi  which is a meandering river in a broad  flat area  only rarely flowing alongside a bluff  as at vicksburg  mississippi  the mississippi river is known as the middle mississippi from the upper mississippi river s confluence with the missouri river at st  louis  missouri  for 190  miles (310  km  to its confluence with the ohio river at cairo  middle mississippi is relatively free-flowing.  from st  louis to the ohio river confluence  the middle mississippi falls 220  feet (67  m  over 180  miles (290  km  for an average rate of 1.2  feet per mile (23  cm km   at its confluence with the ohio river  the middle mississippi is 315  feet (96  m  above sea level  apart from the missouri and meramec rivers of missouri and the kaskaskia river of illinois  no major tributaries enter the middle mississippi river the mississippi river is called the lower mississippi river from its confluence with the ohio river to its mouth at the gulf of mexico  a distance of about 1,000  miles (1,600  km   at the confluence of the ohio and the middle mississippi  the long-term  mean discharge of the ohio at cairo  illinois is 281,500  cubic feet per second (7,970  cubic metres per while the long-term  mean discharge of the mississippi at thebes  illinois  just upriver from cairo  is 208,200  cu ft s (5,900  thus  by volume  the main branch of the mississippi river system at cairo can be considered to be the ohio river  and the allegheny river further upstream   rather than the middle mississippi in addition to the ohio river  the major tributaries of the lower mississippi river are the white river  flowing in at the white river national wildlife refuge in east central arkansas  the arkansas river  joining the mississippi at arkansas post  the big black river in mississippi  and the yazoo river  meeting the mississippi at vicksburg  mississippi  the widest point of the mississippi river is in the lower mississippi portion where it exceeds 1  mile (1.6  km  in width in several places deliberate water diversion at the old river control structure in louisiana allows the atchafalaya river in louisiana to be a major distributary of the mississippi river  with 30%  of the mississippi flowing to the gulf of mexico by this route  rather than continuing down the mississippi s current channel past baton rouge and new orleans on a longer route to the although the red river is commonly thought to be a tributary  it is actually not  because its water flows separately into the gulf of mexico through the atchafalaya river the mississippi river has the world s fourth-largest  drainage basin   watershed  or  catchment    the basin covers more than 1,245,000  square miles (3,220,000  km2),  including all or parts of u s  states and two canadian provinces  the drainage basin empties into the gulf of mexico  part of the atlantic ocean  the total catchment of the mississippi river covers nearly 40%  of the landmass of the continental united states  the highest point within the watershed is also the highest point of the rocky mountains  mount elbert at 14,440  feet (4,400  the united states  the mississippi river drains the majority of the area between the crest of the rocky mountains and the crest of the appalachian mountains  except for various regions drained to hudson bay by the red river of the north  to the atlantic ocean by the great lakes and the saint lawrence river  and to the gulf of mexico by the rio grande  the alabama and tombigbee rivers  the chattahoochee and appalachicola rivers  and various smaller coastal waterways along the gulf the mississippi river empties into the gulf of mexico about 100  miles (160  km  downstream from new orleans  measurements of the length of the mississippi from lake itasca to the gulf of mexico vary somewhat  but the united states geological survey s number is 2,320  miles (3,730  km   the retention time from lake itasca to the gulf is typically about 90  mississippi river discharges at an annual average rate of between 200  and 700  thousand cubic feet per second (7,000–20,000  although it is the fifth-largest  river in the world by volume  this flow is a small fraction of the output of the amazon  which moves nearly 7  million cubic feet per second (200,000  m3/s)  during wet seasons  on average  the mississippi has only 8%  the flow of the amazon river water flowing from the mississippi into the gulf of mexico does not mix into the salt water immediately  the images from nasa s modis  to the right  show a large plume of fresh water  which appears as a dark ribbon against the lighter-blue  surrounding waters  these images demonstrate that the plume did not mix with the surrounding sea water immediately  instead  it stayed intact as it flowed through the gulf of mexico  into the straits of florida  and entered the gulf stream  the mississippi river water rounded the tip of florida and traveled up the southeast coast to the latitude of georgia before finally mixing in so thoroughly with the ocean that it could no longer be detected by modis before 1900,  the mississippi river transported an estimated 400  million metric tons of sediment per year from the interior of the united states to coastal louisiana and the gulf of mexico  during the last two decades  this number was only 145  million metric tons per year  the reduction in sediment transported down the mississippi river is the result of engineering modification of the mississippi  missouri  and ohio rivers and their tributaries by dams  meander cutoffs  river-training  structures  and bank revetments and soil erosion control programs in the areas drained by geologic time  the mississippi river has experienced numerous large and small changes to its main course  as well as additions  deletions  and other changes among its numerous tributaries  and the lower mississippi river has used different pathways as its main channel to the gulf of mexico across the delta region through a natural process known as avulsion or delta switching  the lower mississippi river has shifted its final course to the mouth of the gulf of mexico every thousand years or so  this occurs because the deposits of silt and sediment begin to clog its channel  raising the river s level and causing it to eventually find a steeper  more direct route to the gulf of mexico  the abandoned distributaries diminish in volume and form what are known as bayous  this process has  over the past 5,000  years  caused the coastline of south louisiana to advance toward the gulf from 15  to 50  miles (24  to 80  km   the currently active delta lobe is called the birdfoot delta  after its shape  or the balize delta  after la balize  louisiana  the first french settlement at the mouth of the mississippi the current form of the mississippi river basin was largely shaped by the laurentide ice sheet of the most recent ice age  the southernmost extent of this enormous glaciation extended well into the present-day  united states and mississippi basin  when the ice sheet began to recede  hundreds of feet of rich sediment were deposited  creating the flat and fertile landscape of the mississippi valley  during the melt  giant glacial rivers found drainage paths into the mississippi watershed  creating such features as the minnesota river  james river  and milk river valleys  when the ice sheet completely retreated  many of these  temporary  rivers found paths to hudson bay or the arctic ocean  leaving the mississippi basin with many features  oversized  for the existing rivers to have carved in the same time period ice sheets during the

leaving a small part of tipton county  tennessee  attached to arkansas and separated from the rest of tennessee by the new river channel  since this event was an avulsion  rather than the effect of incremental erosion and deposition  the state line still follows the old the town of kaskaskia  illinois once stood on a peninsula at the confluence of the mississippi and kaskaskia  okaw  rivers  founded as a french colonial community  it later became the capital of the illinois territory and was the first state capital of illinois until 1819.  beginning in 1844,  successive flooding caused the mississippi river to slowly encroach east  a major flood in 1881  caused it to overtake the lower 10  miles of the kaskaskia river  forming a new mississippi channel and cutting off the town from the rest of the state  later flooding destroyed most of the remaining town  including the original state house  today  the remaining 2,300  acre island and community of 14  residents is known as an

corps of engineers  which was established in earlier projects began as early as 1829  to remove snags  close off secondary channels and excavate rocks and sandbars steamboats entered trade in the 1820s,  so the period 1830–1850  became the golden age of steamboats  as there were few roads or rails in the lands of the louisiana purchase  river traffic was an ideal solution  cotton  timber and food came down the river  as did appalachian coal  the port of new orleans boomed as it was the trans-shipment  point to deep sea ocean vessels  as a result  the image of the twin stacked  wedding

mississippi  only with the arrival of the railroads in the 1880s  did steamboat traffic diminish  steamboats remained a feature until the 1920s.  most have been superseded by pusher tugs  a few survive as icons—the delta queen and the river queen for instance a series of 29  locks and dams on the upper mississippi  most of which were built in the 1930s,  is designed primarily to maintain a 9-foot-deep  (2.7  m  channel for commercial barge the lakes formed are also used for recreational boating and fishing  the dams make the river deeper and wider but do not stop it  no flood control is intended  during periods of high flow  the gates  some of which are submersible  are completely opened and the dams simply cease to function  below st  louis  the mississippi is relatively free-flowing,  although it is constrained by numerous levees and directed by numerous wing dams on the lower mississippi  from baton rouge to the mouth of the mississippi  the navigation depth is 45

the upper mississippi  the des moines rapids and the rock island rapids  where the river was shallow and the riverbed was rock  the des moines rapids were about 11  miles (18  km  long and just above the mouth of the des moines river at keokuk  iowa  the rock island rapids were between rock island and moline  illinois  both rapids were considered virtually impassable in 1848,  the illinois and michigan canal was built to connect the mississippi river to lake michigan via the illinois river near peru  illinois  the canal allowed shipping between these important waterways  in 1900,  the canal was replaced by the chicago sanitary and ship canal  the second canal  in addition to shipping  also allowed chicago to address specific health issues  typhoid fever  cholera and other waterborne diseases  by sending its waste down the illinois and mississippi river systems rather than polluting its water source of lake michigan the corps of engineers recommended the excavation of a 5-foot-deep  (1.5  m  channel at the des moines rapids  but work did not begin until after lieutenant robert e  lee endorsed the project in 1837.  the corps later also began excavating the rock island rapids  by 1866,  it had become evident that excavation was impractical  and it was decided to build a canal around the des moines rapids  the canal opened in 1877,  but the rock island rapids remained an obstacle  in 1878,  congress authorized the corps to establish a 4.5-foot-deep  (1.4  m  channel to be obtained by building wing dams which direct the river to a narrow channel causing it to cut a deeper channel  by closing secondary channels and by dredging  the channel project was complete when the moline lock  which bypassed the rock island rapids  opened in 1907.to  improve navigation between st  paul  minnesota  and prairie du chien  wisconsin  the corps constructed several dams on lakes in the headwaters area  including lake winnibigoshish and lake pokegama  the dams  which were built beginning in the 1880s,  stored spring run-off  which was released during low water to help maintain channel depth in 1907,  congress authorized a 6-foot-deep  (1.8  m  channel project on the mississippi  which was not complete when it was abandoned in the late 1920s  in favor of the 9-foot-deep  (2.7  m  channel project in 1913,  construction was complete on lock and dam no

the keokuk dam was one of the largest hydro-electric  plants in the world at the time  the dam also eliminated the des moines rapids  lock and dam no  1  was completed in minneapolis  minnesota in 1917.  lock and dam no  2,  near hastings  minnesota  was completed in 1930.before  the great mississippi flood of 1927,  the corps s primary strategy was to close off as many side channels as possible to increase the flow in the main river  it was thought that the river s velocity would scour off bottom sediments  deepening the river and decreasing the possibility of flooding  the 1927  flood proved this to be so wrong that communities threatened by the flood began to create their own levee breaks to relieve the force of the rising river the rivers and harbors act of 1930  authorized the 9-foot  (2.7  m  channel project  which called for a navigation channel 9  feet (2.7  m  feet deep and 400  feet (120  m  wide to accommodate multiple-barge  this was achieved by a series of locks and dams  and by dredging  twenty-three  new locks and dams were built on the upper mississippi in the 1930s  in addition to the three already in existence until the 1950s,  there was no dam below

confluence with the missouri river  primarily to bypass a series of rock ledges at st  louis  it also serves to protect the st  louis city water intakes during times of low water u s  government scientists determined in the 1950s  that the mississippi river was starting to switch to the atchafalaya river channel because of its much steeper path to the gulf of mexico  eventually the atchafalaya river would capture the mississippi river and become its main channel to the gulf of mexico  leaving new orleans on a side channel  as a result  the u s  congress authorized a project called the old river control structure  which has prevented the mississippi river from leaving its current channel that drains into the gulf via new the large scale of high-energy  water flow threatened to damage the structure  an auxiliary flow control station was built adjacent to the standing control station  this $300  million project was completed in 1986  by the corps of engineers  beginning in the 1970s,  the corps applied hydrological transport models to analyze flood flow and water quality of the mississippi  dam 26  at alton  illinois  which had structural problems  was replaced by the mel price lock and dam in 1990.  the original lock and dam 26  was demolished the corps now actively creates and maintains spillways and floodways to divert periodic water surges into backwater channels and lakes  as well as route part of the mississippi s flow into the atchafalaya basin and from there to the gulf of mexico  bypassing baton rouge and new orleans  the main structures are the birds point-new  madrid floodway in missouri  the old river control structure and the morganza spillway in louisiana  which direct excess water down the west and east sides  respectively  of the atchafalaya river  and the bonnet carré spillway  also in louisiana  which directs floodwaters to lake pontchartrain  see diagram   some experts blame urban sprawl for increases

valley for france  calling the river colbert river after jean-baptiste  colbert and the region la louisiane  for king louis xiv  on march 2,  1699,  pierre le moyne d iberville rediscovered the mouth of the mississippi  following the death of la the french built the small fort of la balise there to control 1718,  about 100  miles (160  km  upriver  new orleans was established along the river crescent by jean-baptiste  le moyne  sieur de bienville  with construction patterned after the 1711  resettlement on mobile bay of mobile  the capital of french louisiana at the time following britain s victory in the seven years war the mississippi became the border between the british and spanish empires  the treaty of paris (1763)  gave great britain rights to all land east of the mississippi and spain rights to land west of the mississippi  spain also ceded florida to britain to regain cuba  which the british occupied during the war  britain then divided the territory into east and west florida article 8  of the treaty of paris (1783)  states   the navigation of the river mississippi  from its source to the ocean  shall forever remain free and open to the subjects of great britain and the citizens of the united states   with this treaty  which ended the american revolutionary war  britain also ceded west florida back to spain to regain the bahamas  which spain had occupied during the war  in 1800,  under duress from napoleon of france  spain ceded an undefined portion of west florida to france  when france then sold the louisiana territory to the u s  in 1803,  a dispute arose again between spain and the u s  on which parts of west florida exactly had spain ceded to france  which would in turn decide which parts of west florida were now u s  property versus spanish property  these aspirations ended when spain was pressured into signing pinckney s treaty in 1795.france  reacquired  louisiana  from spain in the secret treaty of san ildefonso in 1800.  the united states then secured effective control of the river when it bought the louisiana territory from france in the louisiana purchase of 1803.  the last serious european challenge to u s  control of the river came at the conclusion of war of 1812  when british forces mounted an attack on new orleans – the attack was repulsed by an american army under the command of general andrew jackson in the treaty of 1818,  the u s  and great britain agreed to fix the border running from the lake of the woods to the rocky mountains along the 49th  parallel north  in effect  the u s  ceded the northwestern extremity of the mississippi basin to the british in exchange for the southern portion of the red river basin so many settlers traveled westward through the mississippi river basin  as well as settled in it  that zadok cramer wrote a guide book called the navigator  detailing the features and dangers and navigable waterways of the area  it was so popular that he updated and expanded it through 12  editions over a period of 25  years the colonization of the area was barely slowed by the three earthquakes in 1811  and 1812,  estimated at approximately 8  on the richter magnitude scale  that were centered near new madrid  missouri mark twain s book  life on the mississippi  covered the steamboat commerce which took place from 1830  to 1870  on the river before more modern ships replaced the steamer  the book was published first in serial form in harper s weekly in seven parts in 1875.  the full version  including a passage from the then unfinished adventures of huckleberry finn and works from other authors  was published by james r  osgood   company in 1885.the  first steamboat to travel the full length of the lower mississippi from the ohio river to new orleans was the new orleans in december 1811.  its maiden voyage occurred during the series of new madrid earthquakes in 1811–12.  the upper mississippi was treacherous  unpredictable and to make traveling worse  the area was not properly mapped out or surveyed  until the 1840s  only two trips a year to the twin cities landings were made by steamboats which suggests it was not very transport remained a viable industry  both in terms of passengers and freight until the end of the first decade of the 20th  century  among the several mississippi river system steamboat companies was the noted anchor line  which  from 1859  to 1898,  operated a luxurious fleet of steamers between st  louis and new orleans italian explorer giacomo beltrami  wrote about his journey on the virginia  which was the first steam boat to make it to fort st  anthony in minnesota  he referred to his voyage as a promenade that was once a journey on the mississippi  the steamboat era changed the economic and political life of the mississippi  as well as the nature of travel itself  the mississippi was completely changed by the steamboat era as it transformed into a flourishing tourists of the river was a strategic objective of both sides in the american civil war  in 1862  union forces coming down the river successfully cleared confederate defenses at island number 10  and memphis  tennessee  while naval forces coming upriver from the gulf of mexico captured new orleans  louisiana  the remaining major confederate stronghold was on the heights overlooking the river at vicksburg  mississippi  and the union s vicksburg campaign  december 1862  to july 1863),  and the fall of port hudson  completed control of the lower mississippi river  the union victory ending the siege of vicksburg on july 4,  1863,  was pivotal to the union s final victory of the civil war the  big freeze  of 1918–19  blocked river traffic north of memphis  tennessee  preventing transportation of coal from southern illinois  this resulted in widespread shortages  high prices  and rationing of coal in january and the spring of 1927,  the river broke out of its banks in 145  places  during the great mississippi

american heritage rivers in 1997:  the lower portion around louisiana and tennessee  and the upper portion around iowa  illinois  minnesota and missouri  the nature conservancy s project called

2005,  the source to sea paddled the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers to benefit the audubon society s upper mississippi river believe that the lower mississippi could take a new course to the gulf  either of two new routes—through the atchafalaya basin or through lake pontchartrain—might become the mississippi s main channel if flood-control  structures are overtopped or heavily damaged during a severe of the old river control structure  the morganza spillway  or nearby levees would likely re-route  the main channel of the mississippi through louisiana s atchafalaya basin and down the atchafalaya river to reach the gulf of mexico south of morgan city in southern louisiana  this route provides a more direct path to the gulf of mexico than the present mississippi river channel through baton rouge and new while the risk of such a diversion is present during any major flood event  such a change has so far been prevented by active human intervention involving the construction  maintenance  and operation of various levees  spillways  and other control structures by the u s  army corps of engineers the old river control structure  between the present mississippi river channel and the atchafalaya basin  sits at the normal water elevation and is ordinarily used to divert 30%  of the mississippi s flow to the atchafalaya river  there is a steep drop here away from the mississippi s main channel into the atchafalaya basin  if this facility were to fail during a major flood  there is a strong concern the water would scour and erode the river bottom enough to capture the mississippi s main channel  the structure was nearly lost during the 1973  flood  but repairs and improvements were made after engineers studied the forces at play  in particular  the corps of engineers made many improvements and constructed additional facilities for routing water through the vicinity  these additional facilities give the corps much more flexibility and potential flow capacity than they had in 1973,  which further reduces the risk of a catastrophic failure in this area during other major floods  such as that of 2011.because  the morganza spillway is slightly higher and well back from the river  it is normally dry on both even if it failed at the crest during a severe flood  the flood waters would have to erode to normal water levels before the mississippi could permanently jump channel at this needed  during the 2011  floods  the corps of engineers opened the morganza spillway to 1/4  of its capacity to allow 150,000  ft3/sec  of water to flood the morganza and atchafalaya floodways and continue directly to the gulf of mexico  bypassing baton rouge and new in addition to reducing the mississippi river crest downstream  this diversion reduced the chances of a channel change by reducing stress on the other elements of the control geologists have noted that the possibility for course change into the atchafalaya also exists in the area immediately north of the old river control structure  army corps of engineers geologist fred smith once stated   the mississippi wants to go west  1973  was a forty-year  flood  the big one lies out there somewhere—when the structures can t release all the floodwaters and the levee is going to have to give way  that is when the river s going to jump its banks and try to break possible course change for the mississippi river is a diversion into lake pontchartrain near new orleans  this route is controlled by the bonnet carré spillway  built to reduce flooding in new orleans  this spillway and an imperfect natural levee about 4–6  meters (12  to 20  feet  high are all that prevents the mississippi from taking a new  shorter course through lake pontchartrain to the gulf of diversion of the mississippi s main channel through lake pontchartrain would have consequences similar to an atchafalaya diversion  but to a lesser extent  since the present river channel would remain in use past baton rouge and into the new orleans area the sport of water skiing was invented on the river in a wide region between minnesota and wisconsin known as lake ralph samuelson of lake city  minnesota  created and refined his skiing technique in late june and early july 1922.  he later performed the first water ski jump in 1925  and was pulled along at 80  mph (130  km h  by a curtiss flying boat
