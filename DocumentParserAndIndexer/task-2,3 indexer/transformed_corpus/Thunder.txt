 thunder is the sound caused by lightning  depending on the distance and nature of the lightning  thunder can range from a sharp  loud crack to a long  low rumble  brontide   the sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning  in turn  this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave  similar to a sonic boom  which produces the sound of thunder  often referred to as a clap  crack  peal of thunder  or boom the cause of thunder has been the subject of centuries of speculation and scientific inquiry  the first recorded theory is attributed to the greek philosopher aristotle in the fourth century bc  and an early speculation was that it was caused by the collision of clouds  subsequently  numerous other theories were proposed  by the mid-19th  century  the accepted theory was that lightning produced a vacuum in the 20th  century a consensus evolved that thunder must begin with a shock wave in the air due to the sudden thermal expansion of the plasma in the lightning the temperature inside the lightning channel  measured by spectral analysis  varies during its 50  μs existence  rising sharply from an initial temperature of about 20,000  k to about 30,000  k  then dropping away gradually to about 10,000  k  the average is about 20,400  k (20,100  °c  36,300  this heating causes a rapid outward expansion  impacting the surrounding cooler air at a speed faster than sound would otherwise travel  the resultant outward-moving  pulse is a shock similar in principle to the shock wave formed by an explosion  or at the front of a supersonic aircraft experimental studies of simulated lightning have produced results largely consistent with this model  though there is continued debate about the precise physical mechanisms of the other causes have also been proposed  relying on electrodynamic effects of the massive current acting on the plasma in the bolt of the shockwave in thunder is sufficient to cause injury  such as internal contusion  to individuals thunder results when lightning strikes between cloud and ground occur during a temperature inversion  in such an inversion  the air near the ground is cooler than the higher air  the sound energy is prevented from dispersing vertically as it would in a non-inversion  and is thus concentrated in the near-ground  layer  inversions often occur when warm moist air passes above a cold front  the resulting thunder sound is significantly louder than it would be if heard at the same distance in a non-inversion  d in modern english thunder  from earlier old english þunor  is epenthetic  and is now found as well in modern dutch donder  cp middle dutch donre  and old norse þorr  old frisian þuner  old high german donar descended from proto-germanic   þunraz   in latin the term was tonare  to thunder   the name of the germanic god thor comes from the old norse word for shared proto-indo-european  root is *tón-r̥  or *tar-,  also found gaulish taranis and hittite tarhunt a flash of lightning  followed after some time by a rumble of thunder  illustrates the fact that sound travels significantly slower than light  using this difference  one can estimate how far away the bolt of lightning is by timing the interval between seeing the flash and hearing thunder  the speed of sound in dry air is approximately 343  m s or 1,127  ft s or 768  mph (1,236  km h  at 20  °c (68  this translates to approximately 5  seconds per mile  or 3  seconds per kilometer  the speed of light is high enough that it can be taken as infinite in this calculation because of the relatively small distance involved  therefore  the lightning is approximately one kilometer distant for every 3  seconds that elapse between the visible flash and the first sound of thunder  or one mile for every 5  seconds   in the same five seconds  the light could have traveled the lunar distance four times   in this calculation  the initial shock wave  which travels at a rate faster than the speed of sound  but only extends outward for the first 30  feet  is thunder is seldom heard at distances over 20  kilometers (12  a very bright flash of lightning and an almost simultaneous sharp  crack  of thunder  a thundercrack  therefore indicates that the lightning strike was very near  media related to thunder at wikimedia commons
