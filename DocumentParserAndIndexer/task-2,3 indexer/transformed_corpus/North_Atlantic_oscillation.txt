 the north atlantic oscillation  nao  is a weather phenomenon in the north atlantic ocean of fluctuations in the difference of atmospheric pressure at sea level  slp  between the icelandic low and the azores high  through fluctuations in the strength of the icelandic low and the azores high  it controls the strength and direction of westerly winds and location of storm tracks across the north it is part of the arctic oscillation  and varies over time with no particular needed the nao was discovered through several studies in the late 19th  and early 20th  unlike the el niño-southern  oscillation phenomenon in the pacific ocean  the nao is a largely atmospheric mode  it is one of the most important manifestations of climate fluctuations in the north atlantic and surrounding humid needed the north atlantic oscillation is closely related to the arctic oscillation  ao  or northern annular mode  nam   but should not be confused with the atlantic multidecadal oscillation  amo  the nao has multiple possible definitions  the easiest to understand are those based on measuring the seasonal average air pressure difference between stations  such as these definitions all have in common the same northern point  because this is the only station in the region with a long record  in iceland  and various southern points  all are attempting to capture the same pattern of variation  by choosing stations in the  eye  of the two stable pressure areas  the azores high and the icelandic low  shown in the graphic  a more complex definition  only possible with more complete modern records generated by numerical weather prediction  is based on the principal empirical orthogonal function  eof  of surface this definition has a high degree of correlation with the station-based  definition  this then leads onto a debate as to whether the nao is distinct from the ao nam  and if not  which of the two is to be considered the most physically based expression of atmospheric structure  as opposed to the one that most clearly falls out of mathematical winds blowing across the atlantic bring moist air into europe  in years when westerlies are strong  summers are cool  winters are mild and rain is frequent  if westerlies are suppressed  the temperature is more extreme in summer and winter leading to heat waves  deep freezes and reduced permanent low-pressure  system over iceland  the icelandic low  and a permanent high-pressure  system over the azores  the azores high  control the direction and strength of westerly winds into europe  the relative strengths and positions of these systems vary from year to year and this variation is known as the nao  a large difference in the pressure at the two stations  a high index year  denoted nao   leads to increased westerlies and  consequently  cool summers and mild and wet winters in central europe and its atlantic facade  in contrast  if the index is low (nao-),  westerlies are suppressed  northern european areas suffer cold dry winters and storms track southwards toward the mediterranean sea  this brings increased storm activity and rainfall to southern europe and north africa especially during the months of november to april  the nao is responsible for much of the variability of weather in the north atlantic region  affecting wind speed and wind direction changes  changes in temperature and moisture distribution and the intensity  number and track of storms  research now suggests that the nao may be more predictable than previously assumed and skilful winter forecasts may be possible for the having a less direct influence than for western europe  the nao is also believed to affect the weather over much of eastern north america  during the winter  when the index is high  nao    the icelandic low draws a stronger south-westerly  circulation over the eastern half of the north american continent which prevents arctic air from plunging southward  in combination with the el niño  this effect can produce significantly warmer winters over the northeastern united states and southeastern canada  conversely  when the nao index is low (nao-),  the eastern seaboard and southeastern united states can incur winter cold outbreaks more than the norm with associated heavy snowstorms in appalachia/mid-atlantic  region and sub-freezing  conditions into florida  another condition that occurs as result of nao-  is increased polar front activity plunging farther south than usual  beyond the gulf of mexico caribbean sea basins resulting in a break in tropical weather for those regions  as instance of this is when tehuantepecer winds blow outward into the pacific ocean away from the coastline of southern mexico  in summer  a strong nao-  is thought to contribute to a weakened jet stream that normally pulls zonal systems into the atlantic basin contributing significantly to excessively long lasting heat waves over europe under a positive nao index  nao    regional reduction in atmospheric pressure results in a regional rise in sea level due to the  inverse barometer effect   this effect is important to both the interpretation of historic sea level records and predictions of future sea level trends  as mean pressure fluctuations of the order of millibars can lead to sea level fluctuations of the order of centimeters by controlling the position of the azores high  the nao also influences the direction of general storm paths for major north atlantic tropical cyclones  a position of the azores high farther to the south tends to force storms into the gulf of mexico  whereas a northern position allows them to track up the north american atlantic paleotempestological research has shown  few major hurricanes struck the gulf coast during 3000–1400  bc and again during the most recent millennium  these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400  bc and 1000  ad  when the gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5  recently  the nao had been in an overall more positive regime since the late 1970s,  bringing colder conditions to the north-west  atlantic  which has been linked with the thriving populations of labrador sea snow crabs  which have a low temperature nao  warming of the north sea reduces survival of cod larvae which are at the upper limits of their temperature tolerance  as does the cooling in the labrador sea  where the cod larvae are at their lower temperature though not the critical factor  the nao  peak in the early 1990s  may have contributed to the collapse of the newfoundland cod the east coast of the united states an nao  causes warmer temperatures and increased rainfall  and thus warmer  less saline surface water  this prevents nutrient-rich  upwelling which has reduced productivity  georges bank and the gulf of maine are affected by this reduced cod strength of the nao is also a determinant in the population fluctuations of the intensively studied soay enough  jonas and joern (2007)  found a strong signal between nao and grasshopper species composition in the tall grass prairies of the midwestern united states  they found that  even though nao does not significantly affect the weather in the midwest  there was a significant increase in abundance of common grasshopper species  i e  hypochlora alba  hesperotettix spp   phoetaliotes nebrascensis  m  scudderi  m  keeleri  and pseudopomala brachyptera  following winters during the positive phase of nao and a significant increase in the abundance of less common species  i e  campylacantha olivacea  melanoplus sanguinipes  mermiria picta  melanoplus packardii  and boopedon gracile  following winters during a negative phase of the nao  this is thought to be the first study showing a link between nao and terrestrial insects in north winter of 2009–10  in europe was unusually cold  it is hypothesized that this may be due to a combination of low solar a warm phase of the el niño southern oscillation and a strong easterly phase of the quasi-biennial  oscillation all occurring the met office reported that the uk  for example  had experienced its coldest winter for 30  years  this coincided with an exceptionally negative phase of the analysis published in mid-2010  confirmed that the concurrent  el niño  event and the rare occurrence of an extremely negative nao were involved  this has become known as a  hybrid el during the winter of 2010-11  in northern and western europe  the icelandic low  typically positioned west of iceland and east of greenland  appeared regularly to the east of iceland and so allowed exceptionally cold air into europe from the arctic  a strong area of high pressure was initially situated over greenland  reversing the normal wind pattern in the northwestern atlantic  creating a blocking pattern driving warm air into northeastern canada and cold air into western europe  as was the case during the previous winter  this occurred during a la niña season  and is connected to the rare arctic dipole the north western part of the atlantic  both of these winters were mild  especially 2009-2010,  which was the warmest recorded in canada  the winter of 2010-2011  was particularly above normal in the northern arctic regions of that probability of cold winters with much snow in central europe rises when the arctic is covered by less sea ice in summer  scientists of the research unit potsdam of the alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research in the helmholtz association have decrypted a mechanism in which a shrinking summertime sea ice cover changes the air pressure zones in the arctic atmosphere and effects on european winter weather if there is a particularly large-scale  melt of arctic sea ice in summer  as observed in recent years  two important effects are intensified  firstly  the retreat of the light ice surface reveals the darker ocean  causing it to warm up more in summer from the solar radiation (ice-albedo  feedback mechanism   secondly  the diminished ice cover can no longer prevent the heat stored in the ocean being released into the atmosphere  lid effect   as a result of the decreased sea ice cover the air is warmed more greatly than it used to be particularly in autumn and winter because during this period the ocean is warmer than the atmosphere the warming of the air near to the ground leads to rising movements and the atmosphere becomes less stable  one of these patterns is the air pressure difference between the arctic and mid-latitudes:  the so-called  arctic oscillation with the azores highs and iceland lows known from the weather reports  if this difference is high  a strong westerly wind will result which in winter carries warm and humid atlantic air masses right down to europe  in the negative phase when pressure differences are low  cold arctic air can then easily penetrate southward through europe without being interrupted by the usual westerlies  as has been the case frequently over the last three winters  model calculations show that the air pressure difference with decreased sea ice cover in the arctic summer is weakened in the following winter  enabling arctic cold to push down to one of the strongest el nino ever recorded in the pacific ocean  a largely positive north atlantic oscillation prevailed over europe during the winter of 2015-2016.  for example  cumbria in england registered one of the wettest months on record  meanwhile  the maltese islands in the mediterranean sea registered one of the driest years ever recorded up to beginning of march as the island s national average was only 235mm  to date with some areas registering even less than
