 noah s ark  hebrew  תיבת נח‎‎  biblical hebrew  tevat noaḥ  is the vessel in the genesis flood narrative  genesis chapters 6–9)  by which god spares noah  his family  and a remnant of all the world s animals from a world-engulfing  according to genesis  god gave noah instructions for building the ark  seven days before the deluge  god told noah to enter the ark with his household and the animals  the story goes on to describe the ark being afloat for 150  days and then coming to rest on the mountains of ararat and the subsequent receding of the the story is repeated  with variations  in the quran  where the ark appears as safina nūḥ  arabic  سفينة نوح‎‎  noah s boat    the genesis flood narrative is similar to numerous other flood myths from a variety of cultures  the earliest known written flood myth is the sumerian flood myth found in the epic of for noah s ark have been made from at least the time of eusebius  c  275–339  ce  to the present day  there is no scientific evidence for a global flood  and despite many expeditions  no evidence of the ark has been the challenges associated with housing all living animal types  and even plants  would have made building the ark a practical hebrew word for the ark  teba  occurs twice in the bible  in the flood narrative and in the book of exodus  where it refers to the basket in which jochebed places the infant moses   the word for the ark of the is quite different   in both cases teba has a connection with salvation from is warned of the coming flood and told to construct the ark  god spells out to noah the dimensions of the vessel  300  cubits in length  50  cubits in width and 30  cubits in height (450  × 75  × 45  ft or 137  × 22.9  × 13.7  it had three internal divisions  which are not actually called  decks   although presumably this is what is intended   a door in the side  and a tsohar  which may be either a roof or a is made of  gopher  wood  a word which appears nowhere else in the bible  and is divided into qinnim  a word which always refers to birds  nests elsewhere  leading some to emend this to qanim  reeds   the material used for the boat of atrahasis  the babylonian flood-hero.  god instructs noah to kapar  smear  the ark with koper  pitch   in hebrew the first of these words is a verb formed from the second and  like  gopher   it is a word found nowhere else in the bible noah is instructed to take on board his wife  his three sons  and his sons  wives  he is also to take two of every living thing  and seven pairs of every clean creature and of every bird  together with sufficient food the story of the flood closely parallels the story of the creation  a cycle of creation  un-creation,  and re-creation,  in which the ark plays a pivotal the universe as conceived by the ancient hebrews comprised a flat disk-shaped  habitable earth with the heavens above and sheol  the underworld of the dead  these three were surrounded by a watery  ocean  of chaos  protected by the firmament  a transparent but solid dome resting on the mountains which ringed the noah s three-deck  ark represents this three-level  hebrew cosmos in miniature  the heavens  the earth  and the waters in genesis 1,  god created the three-level  world as a space in the midst of the waters for humanity  in genesis 6–8   the flood narrative  he fills that space with waters again  saving only noah  his family and the animals with him in the is a consensus among scholars that the pentateuch  the first five books of the bible  beginning with genesis  was the product of a long and complex process that was not completed until after the babylonian well over a century scholars have recognised that the bible s story of noah s ark is based on older mesopotamian because all these flood stories deal with events that allegedly happened at the dawn of history  they give the impression that the myths themselves must come from very primitive origins  but in fact  the myth of the global flood that destroys all life only begins to appear in the old babylonian period (20th–16th  centuries the reasons for this emergence of the typical mesopotamian flood myth may have been bound up with the specific circumstances of the end of the third dynasty of ur around 2004  bce and the restoration of order by the first dynasty of are nine known versions of the mesopotamian flood story  each more or less adapted from an earlier version  in the oldest version  the hero is king ziusudra and this version was inscribed around 1600  bce in the sumerian city of nippur  it is known as the sumerian flood story  and probably derives from an earlier version  the ziusudra version tells how he builds a boat and rescues life  when the gods decide to destroy it  this remains the basic plot for several subsequent flood-stories  and heroes  including noah  ziusudra s sumerian name means  he of long life   in babylonian versions his name is atrahasis  but the meaning is the same  in the atrahasis version  the flood is a river flood  lines 6–9  atrahasis iii iv probably the most famous version is contained in a longer work called the epic of gilgamesh  now known only from a 1st  millennium assyrian copy in which the flood hero is named utnapishtim  "he-found-life".   gilgamesh is the hero of the complete epic  not the flood story hero  the last known version of the mesopotamian flood story was written in greek in the 3rd  century bce by a babylonian priest named berossus  from the fragments that survive  it seems little changed from the versions of two thousand years version closest to the biblical story of noah  as well as its most likely source  is that of utnapishtim in the epic of the most complete text of utnapishtim s story is a clay tablet dating from the 7th  century bce  but fragments of the story have been found from as far back as the 19th  century parallels – both similarities and differences – between noah s ark and the boat of the babylonian flood-hero  atrahasis have often been noted  noah s ark is rectangular  while atrahasis was instructed to build his in the form of a cube  atrahasis s ark has seven decks with nine compartments on each level  while noah s has three decks  but he is not given any instructions on the number of compartments to the word used for  pitch   sealing tar or resin  is not the normal hebrew word  but is closely related to the word used in the babylonian causes for god gods having sent the flood also differ  in the hebrew narrative the flood comes as god s judgment on a wicked humanity  in the babylonian epic of gilgamesh the reasons are not given and the flood appears to be the result of the caprice of the in the atrahasis version of the babylonian flood story  the flood was sent by the gods to reduce human over-population,  and after the flood  other measures were introduced to prevent the problem tractates sanhedrin  avodah zarah and zevahim relate that  while noah was building the ark  he attempted to warn his neighbors of the coming deluge  but was ignored or mocked  in order to protect noah and his family  god placed lions and other ferocious animals to guard them from the wicked who tried to stop them from entering the ark  according to one midrash  it was god  or the angels  who gathered the animals to the ark  together with their food  as there had been no need to distinguish between clean and unclean animals before this time  the clean animals made themselves known by kneeling before noah as they entered the ark  a differing opinion said that the ark itself distinguished clean animals from unclean  admitting seven pairs each of the former and one pair each of the latter according to sanhedrin 108b,  noah was engaged both day and night in feeding and caring for the animals  and did not sleep for the entire year aboard the the animals were the best of their species  and so behaved with utmost goodness  they abstained from procreation  so that the number of creatures that disembarked was exactly equal to the number that embarked  the raven created problems  refusing to leave the ark when noah sent it forth and accusing the patriarch of wishing to destroy its race  but as the commentators pointed out  god wished to save the raven  for its descendants were destined to feed the prophet elijah according to one tradition  refuse was stored on the lowest of the ark s three decks  humans and clean beasts on the second  and the unclean animals and birds on the top  a differing interpretation described the refuse as being stored on the utmost deck  from where it was shoveled into the sea through a trapdoor  precious stones  said to be as bright as the noon sun  provided light  and god ensured that food remained some more unorthodox interpretations of the ark narrative also surfaced  the 12th-century  jewish commentator abraham ibn ezra interpreted the ark as being a vessel that remained underwater for 40  days  after which it floated to the of the ark narrative played an important role in early christian doctrine  the first epistle of peter  composed around the end of the first century compared noah s salvation through water to salvation through water in 3:20–21]st.  hippolytus of rome  died 235)  sought to demonstrate that  the ark was a symbol of the christ who was expected   stating that the vessel had its door on the east side – the direction from which christ would appear at the second coming – and that the bones of adam were brought aboard  together with gold  frankincense  and myrrh  the symbols of the nativity of christ   hippolytus furthermore stated that the ark floated to and fro in the four directions on the waters  making the sign of the cross  before eventually landing on mount kardu  in the east  in the land of the sons of raban  and the orientals call it mount godash  the armenians call it on a more practical plane  hippolytus explained that the lowest of the three decks was for wild beasts  the middle for birds and domestic animals  and the top level for humans  he says that male animals were separated from the females by sharp stakes so that there would be no breeding on early church father and theologian origen  c  182–251),  in response to a critic who doubted that the ark could contain all the animals in the world  argued that moses  the traditional author of the book of genesis  had been brought up in egypt and would therefore have used the larger egyptian cubit  he also fixed the shape of the ark as a truncated pyramid  square at its base  and tapering to a square peak one cubit on a side  it was not until the 12th  century that it came to be thought of as a rectangular box with a sloping christian artists depicted noah standing in a small box on the waves  symbolizing god saving the christian church in its turbulent early years  st  augustine of hippo (354–430),  in his work city of god  demonstrated that the dimensions of the ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body  which according to christian doctrine is the body of christ and in turn the body of the st  jerome  c  347–420)  identified the raven  which was sent forth and did not return  as the  foul bird of wickedness  expelled by more enduringly  the dove and olive branch came to symbolize the holy spirit and the hope of salvation and eventually  the olive branch remains a secular and religious symbol of peace today ussher s chronology  one of the most prominent attempts to date events according to the bible  calculated that noah would have lived from 2948  until 1998  bce  with the deluge occurring in 2349  bce  calculations based on figures in the hebrew bible place the flood in 1656  am  anno mundi   those based on the greek lxx bible in 2262  am  and those based on the samaritan pentateuch  in 1308  am  the book of jubilees  by a different calculation  also yields the date 1308  am for the flood in contrast to the jewish tradition  which uses a term that can be translated as a  box  or  chest  to describe the ark  surah 29:15  of the quran refers to it as a safina  an ordinary ship  and surah 54:13  describes the ark as  a thing of boards and nails   abd allah ibn abbas  a contemporary of muhammad  wrote that noah was in doubt as to what shape to make the ark  and that allah revealed to him that it was to be shaped like a bird s belly and fashioned of teak ibn  umar al-baidawi,  writing in the 13th  century  explains that in the first of its three levels wild and domesticated animals were lodged  in the second the human beings  and in the third the birds  on every plank was the name of a prophet  three missing planks  symbolizing three prophets  were brought from egypt by og  son of anak  the only one of the giants permitted to survive the flood  the body of adam was carried in the middle to divide the men from the women  surah 11:41  says   and he said   ride ye in it  in the name of allah it moves and stays     this was taken to mean that noah said   in the name of allah   when he wished the ark to move  and the same when he wished it to stand still noah spent five or six months aboard the ark  at the end of which he sent out a raven  but the raven stopped to feast on carrion  and so noah cursed it and sent out the dove  which has been known ever since as the friend of humanity  the medieval scholar abu al-hasan  ali ibn al-husayn  masudi  died 956)  wrote that allah commanded the earth to absorb the water  and certain portions which were slow in obeying received salt water in punishment and so became dry and arid  the water which was not absorbed formed the seas  so that the waters of the flood still exist  masudi says that the ark began its voyage at kufa in central iraq and sailed to mecca  circling the kaaba before finally traveling to mount judi  which surah 11:44  states was its final resting place  this mountain is identified by tradition with a hill near the town of jazirat ibn umar on the east bank of the tigris in the province of mosul in northern iraq  and masudi says that the spot could be seen in his bahá í faith regards the ark and the flood as in bahá í belief  only noah s followers were spiritually alive  preserved in the  ark  of his teachings  as others were spiritually the bahá í scripture kitáb-i-íqán  endorses the islamic belief that noah had numerous companions on the ark  either 40  or 72,  as well as his family  and that he taught for 950   symbolic  years before the the bahá í faith was founded in 19th  century persia  and it recognizes divine messengers from both the abrahamic and the indian traditions the practical challenges associated with building an ark large enough to house all living animal types  and even plants  would have been very various editions of the encyclopædia britannica reflect the collapse of belief in the historicity of the ark in the face of advancing scientific knowledge  its 1771  edition offered the following as scientific evidence for the ark s size and capacity      buteo and kircher have proved geometrically  that  taking the common cubit as a foot and a half  the ark was abundantly sufficient for all the animals supposed to be lodged in it     the number of species of animals will be found much less than is generally imagined  not amounting to a hundred species of quadrupeds   by the eighth edition (1853–60),  the encyclopedia said of the noah story   the insuperable difficulties connected with the belief that all other existing species of animals were provided for in the ark are obviated by adopting the suggestion of bishop stillingfleet  approved by matthew poole     and others  that the deluge did not extend beyond the region of the earth then inhabited   by the ninth edition  in 1875,  no attempt was made to reconcile the noah story with scientific fact  and it was presented without comment  in the 1960  edition  the article on the ark stated that  before the days of  higher criticism  and the rise of the modern scientific views as to the origin of the species  there was much discussion among the learned  and many ingenious and curious theories were advanced  as to the number of animals on the europe  the renaissance saw much speculation on the nature of the ark that might have seemed familiar to early theologians such as origen and augustine  at the same time  however  a new class of scholarship arose  one which  while never questioning the literal truth of the ark story  began to speculate on the practical workings of noah s vessel from within a purely naturalistic framework  in the 15th  century  alfonso tostada gave a detailed account of the logistics of the ark  down to arrangements for the disposal of dung and the circulation of fresh air  the 16th-century  geometer johannes buteo calculated the ship s internal dimensions  allowing room for noah s grinding mills and smokeless ovens  a model widely adopted by other for noah s ark have been made from at least the time of eusebius (c.275–339  ce  to the present day  various locations for the ark have been suggested but have never been the practice is widely regarded as search sites have included durupınar site  a site on mount tendürek in eastern turkey and mount ararat  but geological investigation of possible remains of the ark has only shown natural sedimentary geology is the religiously-inspired  interpretation of the geological history of the earth in terms of the global flood described in genesis 6–9.  similar views played a part in the early development of the science of geology  even after the biblical chronology had been rejected by geologists in favour of an ancient earth  flood geology is a creation science  which is a part of young earth geology and its sub-disciplines  utilize the scientific method to analyze the geology of the earth  flood geology contradicts the scientific consensus in geology and paleontology  as well as that in related disciplines such as chemistry  physics  astronomy  cosmology  biology  geophysics and there is an absence of evidence for any of the effects proposed by flood geologists  and their claims concerning phenomena such as fossil layering are not taken seriously by more generally  the key tenets of flood geology are refuted by scientific and it is considered to be pseudoscience within the scientific author jj dyken notes that established civilizations in egypt and china were not impacted by claims of a global flood during the time of noah s on genesisgeneral
