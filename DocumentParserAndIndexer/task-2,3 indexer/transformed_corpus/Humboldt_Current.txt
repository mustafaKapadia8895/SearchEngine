 the humboldt current system  hcs   also called the peru current  is a major eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem that flows north along the western coast of south it is an eastern boundary current flowing in the direction of the equator  and extend 500-1,000  kilometers offshore  the humboldt current is named after the prussian naturalist alexander von humboldt  in 1846,  von humboldt reported measurements of the cold-water  current in his book current extends from the southern chile (~45’s)  to northern peru (~4’s)  where cold  upwelled waters intersect warm tropical waters to form the equatorial sea surface temperatures off the coast of peru  around 5’s,  reach temperatures as low as this is highly uncharacteristic of tropical waters  as most other regions have temperatures measuring above 25’c.  upwelling brings nutrients to the surface  which support phytoplankton and ultimately increase biological within the current is not uniform across the entire system  three notable upwelling subsystems are produced by this current  i  seasonal upwelling in chile  ii  upwelling “shadow” that is less productive  but still large in northern chile and southern peru  and iii  year-round  upwelling in humboldt current is considered a class i  highly productive (>300  gc/m2-yr),  ecosystem  it is the most productive eastern boundary current it accounts for roughly 18-20%  of the total worldwide marine fish catch  the species are mostly pelagic  sardines  anchovies and jack mackerel  the system’s high productivity supports other important fishery resources as well as marine mammals  eared seals and cetaceans  and seabirds  the cold  nutrient-rich  water brought to the surface by upwelling drives the system’s extraordinary productivity periodically  the upwelling that drives the system’s productivity is disrupted by the el niño-southern  oscillation  enso  event  when this occurs  fish abundance and distribution are significantly affected  often leading to stock crashes and cascading social and economic impacts  these events have led to sequential changes  where sardines and anchovies have replaced each other periodically as the dominant species in the ecosystem  these species changes can have negative consequences for the fishing industry and the economies of the countries that fish the system the humboldt has a considerable cooling influence on the climate of chile  peru and ecuador  it is also largely responsible for the aridity of atacama desert in northern chile and coastal areas of peru and also of the aridity of southern ecuador  marine air is cooled by the current and thus is not conducive to generating precipitation  although clouds and fog are produced  the trade winds are the primary drivers of the humboldt current variability in this system is driven by latitudinal shifts between the intertropical convergent zone and the trade winds in the north  shifts within the south pacific high at mid-latitudes,  as well as cyclonic storms and movement of the southern westerlies southward also contribute to system changes  atmospheric variability off central chile is enhanced by the aggravation of coastal low pressure systems trapped between the marine boundary layer and the coastal mountains  this is prominent poleward from 27’s  to humboldt current  occupying the upper ocean  flows equatorward carrying fresh  cold sub-antarctic  surface water northward  along the outskirts of the subtropical the main flow of the current veers offshore in southern peru  as a weaker limb continues to flow equatorward  around 18’s  the fresh  cold waters begin to mix with the warm  high salinity subtropical surface waters  this collision causes partial subductions  within this region  the equatorial undercurrent  euc  flows eastward along the equator  feeding the peru-chile  undercurrent  pcu  that moves the coast of central chile  there is a coastal transition zone  ctz   which is characterized by high eddy kinetic this energy forms mesoscale eddies which extend 600–800  km offshore  the ctz has three distinct regions within its boundaries  1)  high chlorophyll-a  concentrations in wide regions off the coast of peru (10-15’s),  2)  high chlorophyll-a  concentrations in wide regions off the coast of chile (30’s),  and 3)  high chlorophyll-a  concentrations in narrow regions off the coast of northern chile  montecino and lange 2008).  high chlorophyll-a  concentrations are generally found within 50  km of the limb of the hcs that veers off the coast of peru creates a decrease in ventilation within the this lack of ventilation is the primary driver of an intense oxygen minimum zone  omz  which is formed in the sub-surface  to intermediate depths  in the north  the euc ventilates the omz  and in the south the pcu advects low oxygen waters southward towards northern this omz is the fourth largest permeant hypoxic zone in the world’s oceans  it occupies an area about 2.18  +/-  0.66  x 106  km3.  the core of this zone is centered off peru  creating a shallow upper boundary that reaches from about 100  m down to 600  another factor contributing to the omz is sinking and decay of primary productive the omz forces many organisms to stay near the surface where nutrients and oxygen are the presence of a shallow omz restricts the migration of zooplankton within the water column  between 0  and 600  m  many species of zooplankton occupy this space within the omz  this allows for a substantial exchange of carbon between the euphotic layer and the omz  75%  of the total zooplankton biomass move in and out of the omz  the omz also serves as a refuge for organisms that can live in hypoxic upwelling is the main factor contributing to the high biological productivity of the humboldt upwelling within the current is not uniform across the entire system  three notable upwelling subsystems are produced by this current  i  seasonal upwelling in chile only during the spring and summer  because of the displacement of the subtropical center of high pressure during the winter  january–march   ii  upwelling “shadow” that is less productive  but still large in northern chile and southern peru  and iii  highly productive year-round  upwelling in the upwelling shadow identified between 35’s  and 15’s  is caused by the oligotrophic subtropical gyre impinging on the coast  this creates a narrow  but highly productive  upwelling to the upwelling zones within the humboldt current  biological diversity is extremely high  the current hosts a wide range of organisms including multiple species of plankton  mollusks  sea urchins  crustaceans  fish  and marine the food web starts with the phytoplankton  the conditions of the humboldt current are prime for these organisms to thrive  this causes a cascade effect in which larger and larger organisms are drawn to the area the humboldt current produces some of the most successful commercial fisheries in the the major catches include  sardines  anchovies  mackerel  hake  and squid  three major stocks of anchoveta are distributed between 4’s  and 42’s  within the hcs  north-central  peru’s fishery is primarily composed of one stock of anchoveta  sardines  chub mackerel  and bonito are also common catches  but not as prominent  in southern peru and northern chile host a major sardine fishery  other common stocks include  a second anchoveta stock  jack mackerel  tuna  and swordfish  anchoveta  jack mackerel  and sardines are the primary commercial stocks in central chile anchoveta are found in more recently upwelled waters  close to the coast  sardines  on the other hand  are typically found farther seasonal upwelling plays a major role in the spawning behaviors of both sardines and anchoveta  by spawning at the end of winter  egg and larval survival in greatly enhanced  this is due to the moderate upwelling  which causes lower turbulence  as well as a weakened ekman drift offshore  these two species experience population shifts related to climate changes and environmental events such as el nino  this is due to changes in the availability of each species habitat  anchoveta are an important component in the diets of marine mammals  seabirds  and larger fish  shifts in these populations ultimately cause a shift in the energy processing within the mackerel  jurel  is the second largest fishery in the as with the anchoveta in peru  this species is believed to be composed of a single stock  jurel are a straddling species  this means the species is found both within and outside of the 200-mile  economic exclusive zone  jurel became an important fishery in the 1970s  to alleviate the pressure put on the anchoveta stock  during the 1980s,  however  the jurel decreased in population size due to poor recruitment and overfishing  restrictions of jurel fishing were imposed in 1998  which led to regrowth of the population  since 2002,  the jurel population is now under full the last 15  years  the hake fishery in peru has declined this is due to overfishing  environmental stress  and decreased reproductive capacity  the chilean hake population in central-south  chile catch exceeded 100,000  tons  and has since dropped to 40,000  tons in productivity of the hcs is strongly effected by el niño and la niña during an el niño event  the thermocline and upper region of the omz deepen to greater than 600  m  this causes a loss of nitrogen and decrease in export of carbon  el niño also causes poleward currents to increase in velocity  during non-el  niño years  productivity is very high due to the high nutrient contents  nitrogen recycling through processes such as denitrification  increased carbon export  and remineralization anchoveta fishery in peru was booming during the in 1970,  catches were reported to exceed 12  million tons per year  this accounted for 20%  of the world’s catches  an el niño event occurred during 1972  and caused the anchoveta population to collapse  however  sardine populations saw a dramatic increase in the next 15–20  years  consequently  sardine fisheries grew in this “regime this article incorporates public domain material from the united
