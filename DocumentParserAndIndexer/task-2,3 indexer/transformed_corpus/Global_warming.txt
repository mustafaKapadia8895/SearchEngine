 global warming  also referred to as climate change  is the observed century-scale  rise in the average temperature of the earth s climate system and its related multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is many of the observed changes since the 1950s  are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid-19th  century  and in paleoclimate proxy records covering thousands of 2013,  the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  fifth assessment report concluded that  it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th  the largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide  methane and nitrous oxide  climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st  century  the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3  to 1.7  °c (0.5  to 3.1  °f  in the lowest emissions scenario  and 2.6  to 4.8  °c (4.7  to 8.6  °f  in the highest emissions these findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the anticipated effects include increasing global temperatures  rising sea levels  changing precipitation  and expansion of deserts in the warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the arctic  with the continuing retreat of glaciers  permafrost and sea ice  other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves  droughts  heavy rainfall with floods and heavy ocean acidification  and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes  effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea because the climate system has a large  inertia  and greenhouse gases will remain in the atmosphere for a long time  many of these effects will persist for not only decades or centuries  but for tens of thousands of years to societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction  adaptation to its effects  building systems resilient to its effects  and possible future climate engineering  most countries are parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate parties to the

range of observations  as documented by many independent scientific examples include sea level widespread melting of snow and land increased heat content of the increased and the earlier timing of

larger effective heat capacity of the oceans and because oceans lose more heat by since the beginning of industrialisation in the eighteenth century  the temperature difference between the hemispheres has increased due to melting of sea ice and snow in the in the past one hundred years  average arctic temperatures have been increasing at almost twice the rate of the rest of the world  however  arctic temperatures are also highly although more greenhouse gases are emitted in the northern than in the southern hemisphere  this fact does not contribute to the difference in warming because the major greenhouse gases persist long enough to diffuse within as well as between the thermal inertia of the oceans and the slow responses of other indirect effects occasion the climate to take centuries or longer to adjust to past changes in forcings  one climate commitment study concluded that if greenhouse gases were stabilized at year 2000  levels  surface temperatures would still increase by about one-half  degree and another found that if they were stabilized at 2005  levels  surface warming could exceed a whole degree celsius  some of this surface warming will be driven by past natural forcings which are still seeking equilibrium in the climate system  one study using a highly simplified climate model indicates these past natural forcings may account for as much as 64%  of the committed 2050  surface warming and their influence will fade with time compared to the human temperature is subject to short-term  fluctuations that overlay long-term  trends and can

record-breaking  years attract considerable public interest  individual years are less significant than the overall trend  some climatologists have criticized the attention that the popular press gives to  warmest year  statistics  in particular  ocean oscillations such as the el niño southern oscillation  enso  can cause temperatures of a given year to be abnormally warm or cold for reasons unrelated to the overall trend of climate change  gavin schmidt stated  the long-term  trends or the expected sequence of records are far more important than whether any single year is a record or itself  the climate system may generate random changes in global temperatures for years to decades at a time  but long-term  changes emanate only from so-called  external these forcings are  external  to the climate system  but not necessarily external to examples of external forcings include changes in the composition of the atmosphere  e g   increased concentrations of greenhouse gases   solar

description was developed in the 1930s  through 1960s  by guy stewart earth  an atmosphere containing naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases causes air temperature near the surface to be about 33  °c (59  °f  warmer than it would be in their without the earth s atmosphere  the earth s average temperature would be well below the freezing temperature of the major greenhouse gases are water vapour  which causes about 36–70%  of the greenhouse effect  carbon dioxide (co2),  which causes 9–26%;  methane (ch4),  which causes 4–9%;  and ozone (o3),  which causes clouds also affect the radiation balance through cloud forcings similar to greenhouse gases human activity since the industrial revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  leading to increased radiative forcing from co2,  methane  tropospheric ozone  cfcs and nitrous oxide  according to work published in 2007,  the concentrations of co2  and methane had increased by 36%  and 148%  respectively since these levels are much higher than at any time during the last 800,000  years  the period for which reliable data has been extracted from ice less direct geological evidence indicates that co2  values higher than this were last seen about 20  million years fuel burning has produced about three-quarters  of the increase in co2  from human activity over the past 20  years  the rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land-use,  particularly another significant non-fuel  source of anthropogenic co2  emissions is the calcination of limestone for clinker

readings for co2  taken at the world s primary benchmark site in mauna loa surpassed 400  ppm  according to professor brian hoskins  this is likely the first time co2  levels have been this high for about 4.5  million monthly global co2  concentrations exceeded 400  ppm in march 2015,  probably for the first time in several million on 12  november 2015,  nasa scientists reported that human-made  carbon dioxide continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years  currently  about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans and remains in the the last three decades of the twentieth century  gross domestic product per capita and population growth were the main drivers of increases in greenhouse gas co2  emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use  emissions can be attributed to different regions  attributions of emissions due to land-use  change are subject to considerable scenarios  estimates of changes in future emission levels of greenhouse gases  have been projected that depend upon uncertain economic  sociological  technological  and natural in most scenarios  emissions continue to rise over the century  while in a few  emissions are fossil fuel reserves are abundant  and will not limit carbon emissions in the 21st  emission scenarios  combined with modelling of the carbon cycle  have been used to produce estimates of how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future  using the six ipcc sres  marker  scenarios  models suggest that by the year 2100,  the atmospheric concentration of co2  could range between 541  and 970  this is 90–250%  above the concentration in the year 1750.the  popular media and the public often confuse global warming with ozone depletion  i e   the destruction of stratospheric ozone  e g   the ozone layer  by although there are a few areas of linkage  the relationship between the two is not strong  reduced stratospheric ozone has had a slight cooling influence on surface temperatures  while increased tropospheric ozone has had a somewhat larger warming dimming  a gradual reduction in the amount of global direct irradiance at the earth s surface  was observed from 1961  until at least solid and liquid particles known as aerosols  produced by volcanoes and human-made  pollutants  are thought to be the main cause of this dimming  they exert a cooling effect by increasing the reflection of incoming sunlight  the effects of the products of fossil fuel combustion – co2  and aerosols – have partially offset one another in recent decades  so that net warming has been due to the increase in non-co2  greenhouse gases such as radiative forcing due to aerosols is temporally limited due to the processes that remove aerosols from the atmosphere  removal by clouds and precipitation gives tropospheric aerosols an atmospheric lifetime of only about a week  while stratospheric aerosols can remain for a few years  carbon dioxide has a lifetime of a century or more  and as such  changes in aerosols will only delay climate changes due to carbon black carbon is second only to carbon dioxide for its contribution to global warming  contribution being estimated at 17  to 20%,  whereas carbon dioxide contributes 40  to 45%  to global addition to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing solar radiation  aerosols have indirect effects on the earth s radiation budget  sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets  these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets  a phenomenon known as the twomey this effect also causes droplets to be of more uniform size  which reduces growth of raindrops and makes the cloud more reflective to incoming sunlight  known as the albrecht indirect effects are most noticeable in marine stratiform clouds  and have very little radiative effect on convective clouds  indirect effects of aerosols represent the largest uncertainty in radiative may either cool or warm earth s climate system  depending on whether it is airborne or deposited  atmospheric soot directly absorbs solar radiation  which heats the atmosphere and cools the surface  in isolated areas with high soot production  such as rural india  as much as 50%  of surface warming due to greenhouse gases may be masked by atmospheric brown when deposited  especially on glaciers or on ice in arctic regions  the lower surface albedo can also directly heat the the influences of atmospheric particles  including black carbon  are most pronounced in the tropics and sub-tropics,  particularly in asia  while the effects of greenhouse gases are dominant in the extratropics and southern 1978,  solar irradiance has been measured by these measurements indicate that the sun s radiative output has not increased since then  so the warming that occurred in the past 40  years cannot be attributed to an increase in solar energy reaching the earth climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when only taking into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity  models are  however  able to simulate the observed 20th  century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings  consisting of both human influences and natural forcings another line of evidence for the sun s non-attributability  is the differing temperature changes at different levels in the earth s according to basic physical principles  the greenhouse effect produces warming of the lower atmosphere  the troposphere   but cooling of the upper atmosphere  the if solar variations were responsible for the observed warming  warming of both the troposphere and the stratosphere would be tilt of the earth’s axis and the shape of its orbit around the sun vary slowly over tens of thousands of years  this changes climate by changing the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of incoming solar energy at earth s during the last few thousand years  this phenomenon contributed to a slow cooling trend at high latitudes of the northern hemisphere during summer  a trend that was reversed by greenhouse-gas-induced  warming during the 20th  orbital cycles favorable for glaciation are not expected within the next 50,000  climate system includes a range of feedbacks  which alter the response of the system to changes in external forcings  positive feedbacks increase the response of the climate system to an initial forcing  while negative feedbacks reduce are a range of feedbacks in the climate system  including water vapour  changes in ice-albedo   snow and ice cover affect how much the earth s surface absorbs or reflects incoming sunlight   clouds  and changes in the earth s carbon cycle  e g   the release of carbon from the main negative feedback is the energy the earth s surface radiates into space as infrared according to the stefan-boltzmann  law  if the absolute temperature  as measured in kelvins  radiated energy increases by a factor of 16  (2  to the 4th  are an important factor in determining the sensitivity of the climate system to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations  other factors being equal  a higher climate sensitivity means that more warming will occur for a given increase in greenhouse gas uncertainty over the effect of feedbacks is a major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given forcing scenario  more research is needed to understand the role of and carbon cycle feedbacks in climate ipcc projections previously mentioned span the  likely  range  greater than 66%  probability  based on expert for the selected emissions scenarios  however  the ipcc s projections do not reflect the full range of the lower end of the  likely  range appears to be better constrained than the upper observation based study on future climate change  on the soil carbon feedback  conducted since 1991  in harvard  suggests release of about 190  petagrams of soil carbon  the equivalent of the past two decades of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning  until 2100  from the top 1-meter  of earth s soils  due to changes in microbial communities under elevated climate models do not account for this possible feedback mechanism a climate model is a representation of the physical  chemical and biological processes that affect the climate such models are based on scientific disciplines such as fluid dynamics and thermodynamics as well as physical processes such as radiative transfer  the models may be used to predict a range of variables such as local air movement  temperature  clouds  and other atmospheric properties  ocean temperature  salt content  and circulation  ice cover on land and sea  the transfer of heat and moisture from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere  and chemical and biological processes  among others although researchers attempt to include as many processes as possible  simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system  results from models can also vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and the model s climate sensitivity  for example  the uncertainty in ipcc s 2007  projections is caused by (1)  the use of multiple with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas (2)  the use of differing estimates of humanity s future greenhouse gas (3)  any additional emissions from climate feedbacks that were not included in the models ipcc used to prepare its report  i e   greenhouse gas releases from models do not assume the climate will warm due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases  instead the models predict how greenhouse gases will interact with radiative transfer and other physical processes  warming or cooling is thus a result  not an assumption  of the and their effects are especially difficult to predict  improving the models  representation of clouds is therefore an important topic in current another prominent research topic is expanding and improving representations of the carbon are also used to help investigate the causes of recent climate change by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human causes  although these models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910  to 1945  to either natural variation or human effects  they do indicate that the warming since 1970  is dominated by anthropogenic greenhouse gas physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climate models produce a good match to observations of global temperature changes over the last century  but do not simulate all aspects of not all effects of global warming are accurately predicted by the climate models used by the ipcc  observed arctic shrinkage has been faster than that precipitation increased proportionally to atmospheric humidity  and hence significantly faster than global climate models since 1990,  sea level has also risen considerably faster than models predicted it forcing has likely contributed to some of the observed changes  including sea level rise  changes in climate extremes  such as the number of warm and cold days   declines in arctic sea ice extent  glacier retreat  and greening of the the 21st  century  and snow are projected to continue their widespread retreat  projections of declines in arctic sea ice recent projections suggest that arctic summers could be ice-free   defined as ice extent less than 1  million square km  as early as is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed in some defined statistical sense  without providing a reason for that change  detection does not imply attribution of the detected change to a particular cause   attribution  of causes of climate change is the process of establishing the most likely causes for the detected change with some defined level of detection and attribution may also be applied to observed changes in physical  ecological and social in regional climate are expected to include greater warming over land  with most warming at high northern latitudes  and least warming over the southern ocean and parts of the north atlantic changes in precipitation are expected to follow existing trends  with reduced precipitation over subtropical land areas  and increased precipitation at subpolar latitudes and some equatorial projections suggest a probable increase in the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events  such as heat 2015  study published in nature climate change  states about 18%  of the moderate daily precipitation extremes over land are attributable to the observed temperature increase since pre-industrial  times  which in turn primarily results from human influence  for 2  °c of warming the fraction of precipitation extremes attributable to human influence rises to about 40%.  likewise  today about 75%  of the moderate daily hot extremes over land are attributable to warming  it is the most rare and extreme events for which the largest fraction is anthropogenic  and that contribution increases nonlinearly with further analysis of extreme events from 1960  until 2010  suggests that droughts and heat waves appear simultaneously with increased extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased since sea level rise since 1993  has been estimated to have been on average 2.6  mm and 2.9  mm per year ± 0.4  mm  additionally  sea level rise has accelerated from 1995  to over the 21st  century  the ipcc projects for a high emissions scenario  that global mean sea level could rise by 52–98  the ipcc s projections are conservative  and may underestimate future sea level other estimates suggest that for the same period  global mean sea level could rise by 0.2  to 2.0  m (0.7–6.6  ft   relative to mean sea level in coastal flooding would be expected if several degrees of warming is sustained for for example  sustained global warming of more than 2  °c  relative to pre-industrial  levels  could lead to eventual sea level rise of around 1  to 4  m due to thermal expansion of sea water and the melting of glaciers and small ice melting of the greenland ice sheet could contribute an additional 4  to 7.5  m over many thousands of it has been estimated that we are already committed to a sea-level  rise of approximately 2.3  metres for each degree of temperature rise within the next 2,000  beyond the 2  °c target would potentially lead to rates of sea-level  rise dominated by ice loss from antarctica  continued co2  emissions from fossil sources could cause additional tens of metres of sea level rise  over the next millennia and eventually ultimately eliminate the entire antarctic ice sheet  causing about 58  metres of sea level terrestrial ecosystems  the earlier timing of spring events  as well as poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges  have been linked with high confidence to recent future climate change is expected to affect particular ecosystems  including tundra  mangroves  coral and it is expected that most ecosystems will be affected by higher atmospheric co2  levels  combined with higher global overall  it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species and reduced diversity of in atmospheric co2  concentrations have led to an increase in ocean dissolved co2  increases ocean

projections suggest that surface-ocean  ph could decrease by an additional 0.3–0.4  units by future ocean acidification could threaten coral reefs  fisheries  protected species  and other natural resources of value to deoxygenation is projected to increase hypoxia by 10%,  and triple suboxic waters  oxygen concentrations 98%  less than the mean surface concentrations   for each 1  °c of upper ocean the timescale of centuries to millennia  the magnitude of global warming will be determined primarily by anthropogenic co2  this is due to carbon dioxide s very long lifetime in the the global average temperature would require large reductions in co2  as well as reductions in emissions of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous emissions of co2  would need to be reduced by more than 80%  relative to their peak even if this were achieved  global average temperatures would remain close to their highest level for many as of 2016,  emissions of co2  from burning fossil fuels had stopped increasing  but the guardian reports they need to be  reduced to have a real impact on climate change   meanwhile  this greenhouse gas continues to accumulate in the in that context  the new york times reported that scientific installations analyzing oceanic air detected the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  rose at the highest rate on record in 2015  and it hs been suggested that this rise in co2  levels is the result of changing absorption patterns of the ocean and land surface in that they may have reached the limit of their ability to absorb carbon co2  is not the only factor driving climate change  concentrations of atmospheric methane  another greenhouse gas  rose dramatically between 2006–2016  for unknown reasons  this undermines efforts to combat global warming and there is a risk of an uncontrollable runaway greenhouse effects also include a response from the earth s crust  due to ice melting and deglaciation  in a process called post-glacial  rebound  when land masses are no longer depressed by the weight of ice  this could lead to landslides and increased seismic and volcanic activities  tsunamis could be generated by submarine landslides caused by warmer ocean water thawing ocean-floor  permafrost or releasing gas some world regions  such as the french alps  already show signs of an increase in landslide change could result in global  large-scale  changes in natural and social examples include the possibility for the atlantic meridional overturning circulation to slow-  or shutdown  which in the instance of a shutdown would change weather in europe and north america considerably  ocean acidification caused by increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide  and the long-term  melting of ice sheets  which contributes to sea level large-scale  changes could occur abruptly  i e   over a short time period  and might also be irreversible  examples of abrupt climate change are the rapid release of methane and carbon dioxide from permafrost  which would lead to amplified global warming  or the shutdown of thermohaline scientific understanding of abrupt climate change is generally the probability of abrupt change for some climate related feedbacks may be factors that may increase the probability of abrupt climate change include higher magnitudes of global warming  warming that occurs more rapidly  and warming

mid-20th  century  whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations  whether humankind has contributed significantly to it  and whether the increase is completely or partially an artefact of poor measurements  additional disputes concern estimates of climate sensitivity  predictions of additional warming  and what the consequences of global warming will be by 1990,  american conservative think tanks had begun challenging the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem  they challenged the scientific evidence  argued that global warming would have benefits  and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than some people dispute aspects of climate change organizations such as the libertarian competitive enterprise institute  conservative commentators  and some companies such as exxonmobil have challenged ipcc climate change scenarios  funded scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus  and provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter on the other hand  some fossil fuel companies have scaled back their efforts in recent or even called for policies to reduce global global oil companies have begun to acknowledge climate change exists and is caused by human activities and the burning of fossil global warming problem came to international public attention in the late 1980s.  polling groups began to track opinions on the subject  at first mainly in the united the longest consistent polling  by gallup in the us  found relatively small deviations of 10%  or so from 1998  to 2015  in opinion on the seriousness of global warming  but with increasing polarization between those concerned and those first major worldwide poll  conducted by gallup in 2008–2009  in 127  countries  found that some 62%  of people worldwide said they knew about global warming  in the advanced countries of north america  europe and japan  90%  or more knew about it (97%  in the u s   99%  in japan   in less developed countries  especially in africa  fewer than a quarter knew about it  although many had noticed local weather changes  among those who knew about global warming  there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human 2010,  with 111  countries surveyed  gallup determined that there had been a substantial decrease since 2007–2008  in the number of americans and europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat  in the us  just a little over half the population (53%)  viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families  this was 10  points below the 2008  poll (63%).  latin america had the biggest rise in concern  73%  said global warming was a serious threat to their this global poll also found that people were more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes  except in the us where nearly half (47%)  of the population attributed global warming to natural march–may 2013  survey by pew research center for the people   the press polled 39  countries about global threats  according to 54%  of those questioned  global warming featured top of the perceived global in a january 2013  survey  pew found that 69%  of americans say there is solid evidence that the earth s average temperature has gotten warmer over the past few decades  up six points since november 2011  and 12  points since 2010  survey of 14  industrialized countries found that skepticism about the danger of global warming was highest in australia  norway  new zealand and the united states  in that order  correlating positively with per capita emissions of carbon the 1950s,  research suggested increasing temperatures  and a 1952  newspaper reported  climate change   this phrase next appeared in a november 1957  report in the hammond times which described roger revelle s research into the effects of increasing human-caused  co2  emissions on the greenhouse effect   a large scale global warming  with radical climate changes may result   both phrases were only used occasionally until 1975,  when wallace smith broecker published a scientific paper on the topic   climatic change  are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming   the phrase began to come into common use  and in 1976  mikhail budyko s statement that  a global warming up has started  was widely other studies  such as a 1971  mit report  referred to the human impact as  inadvertent climate modification   but an influential 1979  national academy of sciences study headed by jule charney followed broecker in using global warming for rising surface temperatures  while describing the wider effects of increased co2  as climate 1986  and november 1987,  nasa climate scientist james hansen gave testimony to congress on global warming  there were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988,  and when hansen testified in the senate on 23  june he sparked worldwide he said   global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed public attention increased over the summer  and global warming became the dominant popular term  commonly used both by the press and in public a 2008  nasa article on usage  erik m  conway defined global warming as  the increase in earth’s average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases   while climate change was  a long-term  change in the earth’s climate  or of a region on earth   as effects such as changing patterns of rainfall and rising sea levels would probably have more impact than temperatures alone  he considered global climate change a more scientifically accurate term  and like the intergovernmental panel on climate change  the nasa website would emphasize this wider
