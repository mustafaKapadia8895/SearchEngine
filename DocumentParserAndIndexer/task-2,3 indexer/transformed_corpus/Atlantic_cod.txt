 the atlantic cod  gadus morhua  is a benthopelagic fish of the family gadidae  widely consumed by humans  it is also commercially known as cod or 1]  dry cod may be prepared as unsalted 2]  or as cured salt cod or 3]in  the western atlantic ocean  cod has a distribution north of cape hatteras  north carolina  and around both coasts of greenland and the labrador sea  in the eastern atlantic  it is found from the bay of biscay north to the arctic ocean  including the baltic sea  the north sea  sea of the areas around iceland and the barents sea the largest individual on record was 6  feet (1.8  m  long and weighed 211  lb (96  kg   however usually the cod is between 24  inches (61  cm  and 4  feet (1.2  m  long  and weighs 88  lb (40  kg   there is generally no difference in weight or size between sexes of atlantic cod can live for 25  years  and usually attain sexual maturity between ages two and although cod in the northeast arctic can take as long as eight years to fully colouring is brown or green  with spots on the dorsal side  shading to silver ventrally  a stripe along its lateral line  used to detect is clearly visible  its habitat ranges from the shoreline down to the continental shelf several cod stocks collapsed in the 1990s   declined by >95%  of maximum historical biomass  and have failed to recover even with the cessation of this absence of the apex predator has led to a trophic cascade in many many other cod stocks remain at risk  the atlantic cod is labelled vulnerable on the iucn red list of threatened cod form squirting aggregations from late winter to females release their eggs in and males compete to fertilize fertilized eggs drift with ocean currents and develop into larvae  “fry”   age of maturation varies between cod stocks  from ages two to four in the west but as late as eight years in the northeast cod can live for 13  years or atlantic cod is one of three cod species in the genus gadus along with pacific cod and greenland cod  a variety of fish species are colloquially known as cod  but they are not strictly classified within the gadus genus  though some are in the atlantic cod family  gadidae atlantic cod are a shoaling species and move in large  size-structured  aggregations  larger fish act as scouts and lead the shoal s direction  particularly during post spawning migrations inshore for feeding  cod actively feed during migration and changes in shoal structure occur when food is encountered  shoals are generally thought to be relatively leaderless  with all fish having equal status and an equal distribution of resources and however  some studies suggest that leading fish gain certain feeding benefits  one study of a migrating atlantic cod shoal showed significant variability in feeding habits based on size and position in the shoal  larger scouts consumed a more variable  higher quantity of food  while trailing fish had less variable diets and consumed less food  fish distribution throughout the shoal seems to be dictated by fish size  and ultimately  the smaller lagging fish likely benefit from shoaling because they are more successful in feeding in the shoal than they would be if migrating individually  due to social cod are apex predators in the baltic and adults are generally free from the concerns of juvenile cod  however  may serve as prey for adult cod  which sometimes practice cannibalism  juvenile cod make substrate decisions based on risk of predation  substrates refer to different feeding and swimming environments  without apparent risk of predation  juvenile cod demonstrated a preference for finer-grained  substrates such as sand and gravel-pebble.  however  in the presence of a predator  they preferred to seek safety in the space available between stones of a cobble substrate  selection of cobble significantly reduces the risk of predation  without access to cobble  the juvenile cod simply tries to escape a predator by fleeing additionally  juvenile atlantic cod vary their behaviour according to the foraging behaviour of predators  in the vicinity of a passive predator  cod behaviour changes very little  the juveniles prefer finer-grained  substrates and otherwise avoid the safer kelp  steering clear of the predator  in contrast  in the presence of an actively foraging predator  juveniles are highly avoidant and hide in cobble or in kelp if cobble is apex predators  heavy fishing of cod in the 1990s  and the collapse of american and canadian cod stocks resulted in trophic cascades  overfishing cod removed a significant predatory pressure on other atlantic fish and crustacean species  population-limiting  effects on several species including american lobsters  crabs  and shrimp from cod predation have decreased significantly  and the abundance of these species and their increasing range serve as evidence of the atlantic cod’s role as a major predator rather than are cannibals and are eaten at various life stages by various other fishes  seals and cod have been recorded to swim at speeds of a minimum of 2–5  cm s and a maximum of 21–54  cm s with a mean swimming speed of 9–17  cm s  in one hour  cod have been recorded to cover a mean range of 99  to 226  m2.  swimming speed was higher during the day than at night  this is reflected in the fact that cod more actively search for food during the day  cod likely modify their activity pattern according to the length of daylight  thus activity varies with time of and physiological behaviours change in response to fluctuations in water temperature  respirometry experiments show that heart rates of atlantic cod change drastically with changes in temperature of only a few degrees  a rise in water temperature causes marked increases in cod swimming activity  cod typically avoid new temperature conditions  and the temperatures can dictate where they are distributed in water  they prefer to be deeper  in colder water layers during the day  and in shallower  warmer water layers at night  these fine-tuned  behavioural changes to water temperature are driven by an effort to maintain homeostasis to preserve energy  this is demonstrated by the fact that a change of only 2.5  °c caused a highly costly increase in metabolic rate of 15  to sampling studies have discovered that small atlantic cod feed primarily on crustaceans  while large atlantic cod feed primarily on in certain regions  the main food source is decapods with fish as a complementary food item in the wild atlantic cod throughout the north sea depend  to a large extent  on commercial fish species also used in fisheries  such as atlantic mackerel  haddock  whiting  atlantic herring  european plaice  and common sole  making fishery manipulation of cod significantly ultimately  food selection by cod is affected by the food item size relative to their own size  however  providing for size  cod do exhibit food preference and are not simply driven by cod practice some cannibalism  in the southern north sea  1–2%   by weight  of stomach contents for cod larger than 10  cm consisted of juvenile cod  in the northern north sea  cannibalism was higher  at other reports of cannibalism have estimated as high as 56%  of the diet consists of juvenile cod reproduce during a 1–  to 2-month  spawning season annually  males and females aggregate in spawning schools and each spawning season yields an average of 8.3  egg batches  females release gametes in a ventral mount  and males then fertilize the released eggs  evidence suggests male sound production and other sexually selected characteristics allow female cod to actively choose a spawning partner  males also exhibit aggressive interactions for access to based on behavioral observations of cod  that cod mating systems resemble those of lekking species  which is characterized by males aggregating and establishing dominance hierarchies  at which point females may visit and choose a spawning partner based on status and sexual males experience reproductive hierarchies based on size  larger cod males are ultimately more successful in mating and produce the largest proportion of offspring in a population  however  cod males do experience high levels of sperm competition  in 75%  of examined spawning in one study  sperm from multiple males contributed to offspring  as a result of high competition and unpredictable paternity  males may engage in varied mating strategies and may invest in courtship or may simply ejaculate with other spawning couples  spawning success also varies according to male size relative to female size  males that are significantly smaller than females demonstrate significantly lower success rates relative to males that are larger than cod act as intermediate  paratenic  or definitive hosts to a large number of parasite species  107  taxa listed by hemmingsen and mackenzie and seven new records by perdiguero-alonso  et al  the predominant groups of cod parasites in the northeast atlantic were trematodes (19  species  and nematodes (13  species   including larval anisakids  which comprised 58.2%  of the total number of parasites of atlantic cod include copepods  digeneans  monogeneans  acanthocephalans  cestodes  nematodes  myxozoans  and northwest atlantic cod has been regarded as heavily overfished throughout its range  resulting in a crash in the fishery in the united states and canada during the early 1990s.newfoundland's  northern cod fishery can be traced back to the 16th  century  on average  about 300,000  metric tons of cod were landed annually until the 1960s,  when advances in technology enabled factory trawlers to take larger catches  by 1968,  landings for the fish peaked at 800,000  metric tons before a gradual decline set in  with the reopening of the limited cod fisheries in 2006,  nearly 2,700  metric tons of cod were hauled in  in 2007,  offshore cod stocks were estimated at 1%  of what they were in that contributed to the collapse of atlantic cod include engine-powered  vessels and frozen food compartments aboard ships  engine-powered  vessels had larger nets  greater range  and better navigation  the capacity to catch fish became limitless  in addition  sonar technology gave an edge to detecting and catching fish  sonar was originally developed during world war ii to locate enemy submarines  but was later applied to locating schools of fish  these new technologies  as well as bottom trawlers that destroyed entire ecosystems  contributed to the collapse of atlantic cod  they were vastly different from old techniques used  such as hand lines and long fishery has yet to recover  and may not recover at all because of a possibly stable change in the food chain  atlantic cod was a top-tier  predator  along with haddock  flounder and hake  feeding upon smaller prey  such as herring  capelin  shrimp  and snow with the large predatory fish removed  their prey have had population explosions and have become the top predators  affecting the survival rates of cod eggs and fry in the winter of 2011–2012,  the cod fishery succeeded in convincing noaa to postpone for one year the planned 82%  reduction in catch limits  instead  the limit was reduced by 22%.  the fishery brought in $15.8  million in 2010,  coming second behind georges bank haddock among the region’s 20  regulated bottom-dwelling  groundfish  data released in 2011  indicated that even closing the fishery would not allow populations to rebound by 2014  to levels required under federal law  restrictions on cod effectively limit fishing on other groundfish species with which the cod swim  such as flounder and populations or stocks can differ significantly both in appearance and biology  for instance  the cod stocks of the baltic sea are adapted to low-salinity  water  organisations such as the northwest atlantic fishery organization  nafo  and ices divide the cod into management units or stocks  however  these units are not always biologically distinguishable stocks  some major stocks management units on the canadian us shelf are the southern labrador-eastern  newfoundland stock  nafo divisions 2j3kl),  the northern gulf of st  lawrence stock  nafo divisions 3pn4rs),  the northern scotian shelf stock  nafo divisions 4vsw),  which all lie in canadian waters  and the georges bank and gulf of maine stocks in united states waters  in the european atlantic  the numerous separate stocks are on the shelves of iceland  the coast of norway  the barents sea  the faroe islands  off western scotland  the north sea  the irish sea  the celtic sea  and the baltic sea the northeast atlantic has the world s largest population of cod  by far  the largest part of this population is the northeast arctic cod  as it is labelled by the ices  or the arcto-norwegian  cod stock  also referred to as skrei  a norwegian name meaning something like  the wanderer   distinguishing it from coastal cod  the northeast arctic cod is found in the barents sea area  this stock spawns in march and april along the norwegian coast  about 40%  around the lofoten archipelago  newly hatched larvae drift northwards with the coastal current while feeding on larval copepods  by summer  the young cod reach the barents sea  where they stay for the rest of their lives  until their spawning migration  as the cod grow  they feed on krill and other small crustaceans and fish  adult cod primarily feed on fish such as capelin and herring  the northeast arctic cod also show cannibalistic behaviour  estimated stock size was 2.26  million metric tons in 2008.the  north sea cod stock is primarily fished by european union member states and norway  in 1999,  the catch was divided among denmark (31%),  scotland (25%),  the rest of the united kingdom (12%),  the netherlands (10%),  belgium  germany and norway (17%).  in the 1970s,  the annual catch rose to between 200,000  and 300,000  tons  due to concerns about overfishing  catch quotas were repeatedly reduced in the 1980s  and 1990s.  in 2003,  ices stated a high risk existed of stock collapse if then current exploitation levels continued  and recommended a moratorium on catching atlantic cod in the north sea during 2004.  however  agriculture and fisheries ministers from the council of the european union endorsed the eu norway agreement and set the total allowable catch at 27,300  seafood sustainability guides  such as the monterey bay aquarium s seafood watch  often recommend environmentally conscious customers not purchase atlantic cod the stock of northeast arctic cod was more than four million tons following world war ii  but declined to a historic minimum of 740,000  tons in 1983.  the catch reached a historic maximum of 1,343,000  tons in 1956,  and bottomed out at 212,000  tons in 1990.  since 2000,  the spawning stock has increased quite quickly  helped by low fishing pressure  the total catch in 2012  was 754,131  tons  the major fishers being norway and article incorporates cc by-2.0  text from the
