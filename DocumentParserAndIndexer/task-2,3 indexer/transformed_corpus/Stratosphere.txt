 the stratosphere   ˈstrætəˌsfɪər  is the second major layer of earth s atmosphere  just above the troposphere  and below the mesosphere  about 20%  of the atmosphere s mass is contained in the stratosphere  the stratosphere is stratified in temperature  with warmer layers higher and cooler layers closer to the earth  the increase of temperature with altitude is a result of the absorption of the sun s ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer  this is in contrast to the troposphere  near the earth s surface  where temperature decreases with altitude  the border between the troposphere and stratosphere  the tropopause  marks where this temperature inversion begins  near the equator  the stratosphere starts at 18  km (59,000  ft  11  mi   at mid latitudes  it starts at 10–13  km (33,000–43,000  ft  6.2–8.1  mi  and ends at 50  km (160,000  ft  31  mi   at the poles  it starts at about 8  km (26,000  ft  5.0  mi   temperatures vary within the stratosphere with the seasons  in particular with the polar night  winter   the greatest variation of temperature takes place over the poles in the lower stratosphere  variations at lower latitudes and higher altitudes are smaller the mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by british mathematician sydney chapman in 1930.  molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the uv-c  region  at wavelengths shorter than about 240  nm  the oxygen atoms produced combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone  ozone in turn is photolysed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths  where the solar emission is more intense  ozone (o3)  photolysis produces o and o2.  the oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform o3,  releasing heat  the rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion  this increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere  its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified  within the stratosphere temperatures increase with altitude  see temperature inversion   the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270  k (−3°c  or this vertical stratification  with warmer layers above and cooler layers below  makes the stratosphere dynamically stable  there is no regular convection and associated turbulence in this part of the atmosphere  however  exceptionally energetic convection processes  such as volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops in severe supercell thunderstorms  may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis  overall the attenuation of solar uv at wavelengths that damage dna by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the surface of the planet outside of the ocean  all air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause  the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere  the rising air is literally freeze dried  the stratosphere is a very dry place  the top of the stratosphere is called the stratopause  above which the temperature decreases with height sydney chapman gave a correct description of the source of stratospheric ozone and its ability to generate heat within the stratosphere  he also wrote that ozone may be destroyed by reacting with atomic oxygen  making two molecules of molecular oxygen  we now know that there are additional ozone loss mechanisms  and that these mechanisms are catalytic meaning that a small amount of the catalyst can destroy a great number of ozone molecules  the first is due to the reaction of hydroxyl radicals oh· with ozone  oh is formed by the reaction of electronically excited oxygen atoms produced by ozone photolysis  with water vapor  while the stratosphere is dry  additional water vapor is produced in situ by the photochemical oxidation of methane (ch4).  the ho2  radical produced by the reaction of oh with o3  is recycled to oh by reaction with oxygen atoms or ozone  in addition  solar proton events can significantly effect ozone levels via radiolysis with the subsequent formation of oh   laughing gas or nitrous oxide (n2o)  is produced by biological activity at the surface and is oxidised to no in the stratosphere  the so-called  nox radical cycles also deplete stratospheric ozone  finally  chlorofluorocarbon molecules are photolysed in the stratosphere releasing chlorine atoms that react with ozone giving clo and o2.  the chlorine atoms are recycled when clo reacts with o in the upper stratosphere  or when clo reacts with itself in the chemistry of the antarctic ozone hole  paul j  crutzen  mario j  molina and f  sherwood rowland were awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 1995  for their work describing the formation and decomposition of stratospheric ozone commercial airliners typically cruise at altitudes of 9–12  km (30,000–39,000  ft  which is in the lower reaches of the stratosphere in temperate this optimizes fuel efficiency  mostly due to the low temperatures encountered near the tropopause and low air density  reducing parasitic drag on the airframe  stated another way  it allows the airliner to fly faster for the same amount of drag  it also allows them to stay above the turbulent weather of the troposphere the concorde aircraft cruised at mach 2  at about 18,000  m (59,000  ft   and the sr-71  cruised at mach 3  at 26,000  m (85,000  ft   all within the stratosphere because the temperature in the tropopause and lower stratosphere is largely constant with increasing altitude  very little convection and its resultant turbulence occurs there  most turbulence at this altitude is caused by variations in the jet stream and other local wind shears  although areas of significant convective activity  thunderstorms  in the troposphere below may produce turbulence as a result of convective overshoot on october 24,  2014,  alan eustace became the record holder for reaching the altitude record for a manned balloon at 135,890  ft (41,419  m   dr eustace also broke the world records for vertical speed reached with a peak velocity of 1,321  km h (822  mph  and total freefall distance of 123,414  ft (37,617  m  – lasting four minutes and 27  stratosphere is a region of intense interactions among radiative  dynamical  and chemical processes  in which the horizontal mixing of gaseous components proceeds much more rapidly than does vertical mixing  the overall circulation of the stratosphere is termed as brewer-dobson  circulation  which is a single celled circulation  spanning from the tropics up to the poles  consisting of the tropical upwelling of air from the tropical troposphere and the extra-tropical  downwelling of air  stratospheric circulation is a pre-dominantly  wave-driven  circulation in that the tropical upwelling is induced by the wave force by the westward propagating rossby waves  in a phenomenon called rossby-wave  pumping an interesting feature of stratospheric circulation is the qbo in the tropical latitudes  which is driven by gravity waves that are convectively generated in the troposphere  the qbo induces a secondary circulation that is important for the global stratospheric transport of tracers  such as or water vapor another large-scale  feature that significantly influences stratospheric circulation is the breaking planetary resulting in intense quasi-horizontal  mixing in the midlatitudes  this breaking is much more pronounced in the winter hemisphere where this region is called the surf zone  this breaking is caused due to a highly non-linear  interaction between the vertically propagating planetary waves and the isolated high potential vorticity region known as polar vortex  the resultant breaking causes large scale mixing of air and other trace gases throughout the midlatitude surf zone  the timescale of this rapid mixing is much smaller than the much slower timescales of upwelling in the tropics and downwelling in the extratropics during northern hemispheric winters  sudden stratospheric warmings  caused by the absorption of rossby waves in the stratosphere  can be observed in approximately half of winters when easterly winds develop in the stratosphere  these events often precede unusual winter weather and may even be responsible for the cold european winters of the warming of the polar vortex results in its weakening  when the vortex is strong  it keeps the cold  high pressure air masses contained in the arctic  when the vortex weakens  air masses move equatorward  and results in rapid changes of weather in the mid latitudes bacterial life survives in the stratosphere  making it a part of the in 2001  an indian experiment  involving a high-altitude  balloon  was carried out at a height of 41  kilometres and a sample of dust was collected with bacterial material bird species have been reported to fly at the lower levels of the stratosphere  on november 29,  1973,  a rüppell s vulture  gyps rueppelli  was ingested into a jet engine 11,278  m (37,000  ft  above the ivory coast  and bar-headed  geese  anser indicus  reportedly overfly mount
