 hd 209458  b  also given the nickname is an exoplanet that orbits the solar analog hd 209458  in the constellation pegasus  some 150  light-years  from the solar system  the radius of the planet s orbit is 7  million kilometres  about 0.047  astronomical units  or one eighth the radius of mercury s orbit  this small radius results in a year that is 3.5  earth days long and an estimated surface temperature of about 1,000  °c  about 1,800  °f   its mass is 220  times that of earth (0.69  jupiter masses  and its volume is some 2.5  times greater than that of jupiter  the high mass and volume of hd 209458  b indicate that it is a gas giant hd 209458  b represents a number of milestones in extraplanetary research  it was the first of many categories based on the application of new  theoretical models  as of april 2007,  it is alleged to be the first extrasolar planet found to have water vapor in its july  2014,  nasa announced finding very dry atmospheres on hd 209458  b and two other exoplanets  hd 189733  b and wasp-12b)  orbiting sun-like  studies first revealed the presence of a planet around hd 209458  on november 5,  1999.  astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets  in the hope that they might observe a dip in brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star s face  this would require the planet s orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the earth and the star  and previously no transits had been detected soon after the discovery  separate teams  one led by david charbonneau including timothy brown and others  and the other by gregory w  henry  were able to detect a transit of the planet across the surface of the star making it the first known transiting extrasolar planet  on september 9  and 16,  1999,  charbonneau s team measured a 1.7%  drop in hd 209458's  brightness  which was attributed to the passage of the planet across the star  on november 8,  henry s team observed a partial transit  seeing only the initially unsure of their results  the henry group decided to rush their results to publication after overhearing rumors that charbonneau had successfully seen an entire transit in september  papers from both teams were published simultaneously in the same issue of the astrophysical journal  each transit lasts about three hours  during which the planet covers about 1.5%  of the star s face the star had been observed many times by the hipparcos satellite  which allowed astronomers to calculate the orbital period of hd 209458  b very accurately at 3.524736  analysis had shown that the planet had a mass about 0.69  times that of the occurrence of transits allowed astronomers to calculate the planet s radius  which had not been possible for any previously known exoplanet  and it turned out to have a radius some 35%  larger than jupiter s on march 22,  2005,  nasa released news that infrared light from the planet had been measured by the spitzer space telescope  the first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet  this was done by subtracting the parent star s constant light and noting the difference as the planet transited in front of the star and was eclipsed behind it  providing a measure of the light from the planet itself  new measurements from this observation determined the planet s temperature as at least 750  °c (1300  °f   the circular orbit of hd 209458  b was also confirmed on february 21,  2007,  nasa and nature released news that hd 209458  b was one of the first two extrasolar planets to have their spectra directly observed  the other one being hd 189733  this was long seen as the first mechanism by which extrasolar but non-sentient  life forms could be searched for  by way of influence on a planet s atmosphere  a group of investigators led by jeremy richardson of nasa s goddard space flight center spectrally measured hd 209458  b s atmosphere in the range of 7.5  to 13.2  micrometres  the results defied theoretical expectations in several ways  the spectrum had been predicted to have a peak at 10  micrometres which would have indicated water vapor in the atmosphere  but such a peak was absent  indicating no detectable water vapor  another unpredicted peak was observed at 9.65  micrometres  which the investigators attributed to clouds of silicate dust  a phenomenon not previously observed  another unpredicted peak occurred at 7.78  micrometres  for which the investigators did not have an explanation  a separate team led by mark swain of the jet propulsion laboratory reanalyzed the richardson et al  data  and had not yet published their results when the richardson et al  article came out  but made similar findings on 23  june 2010,  astronomers announced they have measured a superstorm  with windspeeds of up to 7000  km h  for the first time in the atmosphere of hd 209458  the very high-precision  observations done by eso’s very large telescope and its powerful crires spectrograph of carbon monoxide gas show that it is streaming at enormous speed from the extremely hot day side to the cooler night side of the planet  the observations also allow another exciting  first —measuring the orbital speed of the exoplanet itself  providing a direct determination of its of august 2008,  the most recent calculation of hd 209458  b s rossiter–mclaughlin effect and hence spin–orbit angle is −4.4  ± had been previously hypothesized that hot jupiters particularly close to their parent star should exhibit this kind needed  of inflation due to intense heating of their outer atmosphere  tidal heating due to its orbit s eccentricity  which may have been more eccentric at formation  may also have played a role over the past billion atmosphere is at a pressure of one bar at an altitude of 1.29  jupiter radii above the planet s the pressure is 33±5  millibars  the atmosphere is clear  probably hydrogen  and its rayleigh effect is detectable  at that pressure the temperature is 2200±260  by the orbiting microvariability and oscillations of stars telescope initially limited the planet s albedo  or reflectivity  below 0.3,  making it a surprisingly dark object   the geometric albedo has since been measured to be 0.038  ± in comparison  jupiter has a much higher albedo of 0.52.  this would suggest that hd 209458  b s upper cloud deck is either made of less reflective material than is jupiter s  or else has no clouds and rayleigh-scatters  incoming radiation like earth s dark models since then have shown that between the top of its atmosphere and the hot  high pressure gas surrounding the mantle  there exists a stratosphere of cooler this implies an outer shell of dark  opaque  hot cloud  usually thought to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides like red dwarfs   pm planets    but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out the rayleigh-scattering  heated hydrogen rests at the top of the stratosphere  the absorptive portion of the cloud deck floats above it at 25  that level  on november 27,  2001  the hubble space telescope detected sodium  the first planetary atmosphere outside the solar system to be this detection was predicted by sara seager in late the core of the sodium line runs from pressures of 50  millibar to a this turns out to be about a third the amount of sodium at hd 189733  2003–4,  astronomers used the hubble space telescope imaging spectrograph to discover an enormous ellipsoidal envelope of hydrogen  carbon and oxygen around the planet that reaches 10,000  k  the hydrogen exosphere extends to a distance rh=3.1  rj  much larger than the planetary radius of 1.32  at this temperature and distance  the maxwell–boltzmann distribution of particle velocities gives rise to a significant  tail  of atoms moving at speeds greater than the escape velocity  the planet is estimated to be losing about 100–500  million (1–5×108)  kg of hydrogen per second  analysis of the starlight passing through the envelope shows that the heavier carbon and oxygen atoms are being blown from the planet by the extreme  hydrodynamic drag  created by its evaporating hydrogen atmosphere  the hydrogen tail streaming from the planet is approximately 200,000  kilometres long  which is roughly equivalent to its diameter it is thought that this type of atmosphere loss may be common to all planets orbiting sun-like  stars closer than around 0.1  au  hd 209458  b will not evaporate entirely  although it may have lost up to about 7%  of its mass over its estimated lifetime of 5  billion it may be possible that the planet s magnetic field may prevent this loss  because the exosphere would become ionized by the star  and the magnetic field would contain the ions from april 10,  2007,  travis barman of the lowell observatory announced evidence that the atmosphere of hd 209458  b contained water vapor  using a combination of previously published hubble space telescope measurements and new theoretical models  barman found strong evidence for water absorption in the planet s his method modeled light passing directly through the atmosphere from the planet s star as the planet passed in front of it  however  this hypothesis is still being investigated for confirmation barman drew on data and measurements taken by heather knutson  a student at harvard university  from the hubble space telescope  and applied new theoretical models to demonstrate the likelihood of water absorption in the atmosphere of the planet  the planet orbits its parent star every three and a half days  and each time it passes in front of its parent star  the atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how the atmosphere absorbs light passing from the star directly through the atmosphere in the direction of earth according to a summary of the research  atmospheric water absorption in such an exoplanet renders it larger in appearance across one part of the infrared spectrum  compared to wavelengths in the visible spectrum  barman took knutson s hubble data on hd 209458  b  applied to his theoretical model  and allegedly identified water absorption in the planet s atmosphere on april 24,  the astronomer david charbonneau  who led the team that made the hubble observations  cautioned that the telescope itself may have introduced variations that caused the theoretical model to suggest the presence of water  he hoped that further observations would clear the matter up in the following as of april 2007,  further investigation is being conducted on october 20,  2009,  researchers at jpl announced the discovery of water vapor  carbon dioxide  and methane in the 2014,  a magnetic field around hd 209458  b was inferred from the way hydrogen was evaporating from the planet  it is the first  indirect  detection of a magnetic field on an exoplanet  the magnetic field is estimated to be about one tenth as strong as 22h  03m  10.8s,  18°  53′
