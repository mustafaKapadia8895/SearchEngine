 the paraná-etendeka  traps  or paraná and etendeka plateau  or paraná and etendeka province  comprise a large igneous province which includes both the main paraná traps  in paraná basin  a south american geological basin  as well as the smaller severed portions of the flood basalts at the etendeka traps  in northwest namibia and southwest angola   the original basalt flows occurred 128  to 138  million years ago  the province had a post-flow  surface area of 1.5  x 106  km² (580,000  miles²  and an original volume projected to be in excess of 2.3  x 106  basalt samples at paraná and etendeka have an age of about 132  indirectly  the rifting and extension are probably the origin of the paraná and etendeka traps and it could be the origin of the gough and tristan da cunha islands as well  as they are connected by the walvis ridge  gough tristan hotspot   the seamounts of the rio grande rise (25°s  to 35°s)  that go eastwards from the paraná are part of this traps of geochemistry  including isotopes  have led geologists to conclude that the magmas forming the traps and associated igneous rocks formed by melting of asthenosphic mantle due to the arrival of a mantle plume to the base of earth s lithosphere  then much of the magma was contaminated with crustal materials prior to their eruption  some plutonic rocks related to the traps escaped crustal contamination reflecting more directly the source of the magmas in the type of rock called ignimbrite is found in some parts of the traps indicating explosive volcanic activity  the paraná traps possibly contains the site of the single largest explosive volcanic eruption known in earth s
