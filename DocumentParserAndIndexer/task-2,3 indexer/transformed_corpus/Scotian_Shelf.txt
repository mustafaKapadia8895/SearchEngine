 the scotian shelf is a geological formation  part of the continental shelf  located southwest of nova scotia  canada  it covers an area of 120,000  is 700  km long and ranges in width from 120  to 240  km  it has an average depth of 90  the scotian shelf contains the ecologically important scotian shelf large marine ecosystem  lme  and the scotian shelf waters northeastern boundary is defined by the laurentian channel  where it drops off to 400  m  further south is the continental slope  which sharply drops off to a depth of more than 3,000  the southwestern boundary ends at the northeast channel  including the gulf of scotian shelf is characterized by shallow  offshore banks 25  m to 100  m under the ocean surface  with deep basins and troughs between that vary in depth from 160  m to 300  these culminate at sable southwesterly ocean current   occasionally containing runoff from the gulf of st lawrence  flows over the inner shelf  the water flow over the banks is weaker and tends have greater the scotian shelf contains a canyon called the  gully   which is more than 1000  m deep  currents flow through this canyon southward  mixing offshore waters with the nova scotia current  this causes an increase in biological productivity toward the east  across the continental shelf the scotian shelf is heavily influenced by the gulf stream  resulting in a variety of marine species being present which are normally found further south  these appear at regular intervals due to the main current spinning off cores of warm scotian shelf large marine ecosystem  lme  contains numerous species  including a broad range of shellfish and fishes that use the area as spawning and nursery grounds  this abundance is the reason that the scotian shelf is one of the atlantic ocean s most fished areas the right whale has a critical habitat in the roseway basin  the northeastern part of the scotian shelf  approximately 30  percent of the known population uses this habitat throughout the course of the northern bottlenose whale also lives in the scotian shelf waters area  in particular  the gully  about 230  individual specimens have been recorded there  other species  such as the sperm whale and harbour seal  are also found in this region  including the grey seal  which is common on sable waterfowl use the coastal areas as a migratory staging area  offshore areas are used by such birds as dovekies  murres  shearwaters  sea ducks such as the common eider  and
