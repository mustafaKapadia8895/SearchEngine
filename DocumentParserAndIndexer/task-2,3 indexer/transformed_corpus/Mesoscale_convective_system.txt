 a mesoscale convective system  mcs  is a complex of thunderstorms that becomes organized on a scale larger than the individual thunderstorms but smaller than extratropical cyclones  and normally persists for several hours or more  a mesoscale convective system s overall cloud and precipitation pattern may be round or linear in shape  and include weather systems such as tropical cyclones  squall lines  lake-effect  snow events  polar lows  and mesoscale convective complexes  mccs   and generally form near weather fronts  the type that forms during the warm season over land has been noted across north america  europe  and asia  with a maximum in activity noted during the late afternoon and evening hours forms of mcs that develop within the tropics use either the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon troughs as a focus for their development  generally within the warm season between spring and fall  one exception is that of lake-effect  snow bands  which form due to cold air moving across relatively warm bodies of water  and occurs from fall through spring  polar lows are a second special class of mcs which form at high latitudes during the cold season  once the parent mcs dies  later thunderstorm development can occur in connection with its remnant mesoscale convective vortex  mcv   mesoscale convective systems are important to the united states rainfall climatology over the great plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season rainfall mesoscale convective systems are thunderstorm regions which may be round or linear in shape  on the order of 100  kilometres (62  mi  or more across in one direction but smaller than extratropical and include systems such as tropical cyclones  squall lines  and mesoscale convective complexes  mccs   among others  mcs is a more generalized term which includes systems that do not satisfy the stricter size  shape  or duration criteria of an mcc  they tend to form near weather fronts and move into areas of 1000-500  mb thickness diffluence  which are areas where the low to mid level temperature gradient broadens  which generally steers the thunderstorm clusters into the warm sector of extratropical cyclones  or equatorward of warm fronts  they can also form along any convergent zones within the tropics  their formation has been noted worldwide  from the mei-yu  front in the far east to the deep mesoscale convective systems are important to the united states rainfall climatology over the great plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season rainfall there are four main types of thunderstorms  single-cell,  multi-cell,  squall line  also called multi-cell  line  and supercell  which type forms depends on the instability and relative wind conditions at different layers of the atmosphere   wind shear    single-cell  thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20–30  minutes  organized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of sufficient moisture  significant vertical wind shear  normally greater than 25  knots (13  m s  in the lowest 6  kilometres (3.7  mi  of the which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather  the supercell is the strongest of the thunderstorms  most commonly associated with large hail  high winds  and tornado formation precipitable water values of greater than 31.8  millimetres (1.25  in  favor the development of organized thunderstorm those with heavy rainfall normally have precipitable water values greater than 36.9  millimetres (1.45  normally greater than 25  knots (13  upstream values of cape of greater than 800  j kg are usually required for the development of organized mesoscale convective complex  mcc  is a unique kind of mesoscale convective system which is defined by characteristics observed in infrared satellite imagery  their area of cold cloud tops exceeds 100,000  square kilometres (39,000  sq mi  with temperature less than or equal to −32  °c (−26  °f   and an area of cloud top of 50,000  square kilometres (19,000  sq mi  with temperature less than or equal to −52  °c (−62  °f   size definitions must be met for six hours or greater  its maximum extent is defined as when the cloud shield  or the overall cloud reaches its maximum area  its eccentricity  minor axis major axis  is greater than or equal to 0.7  at maximum extent  so they are fairly round  they are long-lived,  nocturnal in formation as they tend to form overnight  and commonly contain heavy rainfall  wind  hail  lightning and possibly squall line is an elongated line of severe thunderstorms that can form along and or ahead of a cold in the early 20th  century  the term was used as a synonym for cold the squall line contains heavy precipitation  hail  frequent lightning  strong straight line winds  and possibly tornadoes and severe weather  in form of strong straight-line  winds can be expected in areas where the squall line itself is in the shape of a bow echo  within the portion of the line which bows out the tornadoes can be found along waves within a line echo wave pattern  or lewp  where mesoscale low pressure areas are some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos  and they move quite fast through large sections of on the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines  a wake low can form  which is a mesoscale low pressure area that forms behind the mesoscale high pressure system normally present under the rain canopy  which are sometimes associated with a heat another term that may be used in association with squall line and bow echoes is quasi-linear  convective systems tropical cyclone is a fairly symmetric storm system characterized by a low pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and flooding rain  a tropical cyclone feeds on the heat released when moist air rises  resulting in condensation of water vapour contained in the moist air  it is fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as nor easters  european windstorms  and polar lows  leading to their classification as  warm core  storm term  tropical  refers to both the geographic origin of these systems  which form often in tropical regions of the globe  and their formation in maritime tropical air masses  the term  cyclone  refers to such storms  cyclonic nature  with counterclockwise rotation in the northern hemisphere and clockwise rotation in the southern hemisphere  depending on their location and strength  tropical cyclones are referred to by other names  such as hurricane  typhoon  tropical storm  cyclonic storm  tropical depression  or simply as a cyclone  generally speaking  a tropical cyclone is referred to as a hurricane  from the name of the ancient central american deity of wind  huracan  in the atlantic and eastern pacific oceans  a typhoon across the northwest pacific ocean  and a cyclone across in the southern hemisphere and indian cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rain  as well as high waves and damaging storm they develop over large bodies of warm and lose their strength if they move over this is the reason coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone  while inland regions are relatively safe from the strong winds  heavy rains  however  can produce significant flooding inland  and storm surges can produce extensive coastal flooding up to 40  kilometres (25  mi  from the coastline  although their effects on human populations can be devastating  tropical cyclones can also relieve drought they also carry heat and energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes  which makes them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation mechanism  as a result  tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the earth s troposphere  and to maintain a relatively stable and warm many tropical cyclones develop when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable  others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics  tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere  if the conditions remain favorable  the tropical disturbance intensifies  and can even develop an eye  on the other end of the spectrum  if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall  the system weakens and eventually dissipates  a tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air from an operational standpoint  a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become a subtropical cyclone during its extratropical snow is produced in the winter in the shape of one or more elongated bands when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water  providing energy and picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited on the lee the same effect over bodies of salt water is called ocean effect sea effect or even bay effect the effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic effect of higher elevations on the downwind shores  this uplifting can produce narrow  but very intense bands of precipitation  which is deposited at a rate of many inches of snow per hour and often brings copious snowfall totals  the areas affected by lake-effect  snow are called snowbelts  this effect occurs in many locations throughout the world  but is best known in the populated areas of the great lakes of north the air temperature is not low enough to keep the precipitation frozen  it falls as lake-effect  rain  in order for lake-effect  rain or snow to form  the air moving across the lake must be significantly cooler than the surface air  which is likely to be near the temperature of the water surface   specifically  the air temperature at the altitude where the air pressure is 850  millibars  or 1.5  kilometres (0.93  mi  altitude  should be 13  °c (24  °f  lower than the temperature of the air at the lake-effect  occurring when the air at 850  millibars is 25  °c (45  °f  colder than the water temperature can produce thundersnow  snow showers accompanied by lightning and thunder  due to the larger amount of energy available from the increased polar low is a small-scale,  symmetric  short-lived  atmospheric low pressure system  depression  that is found over the ocean areas poleward of the main polar front in both the northern and southern hemispheres  the systems usually have a horizontal length scale of less than 1,000  kilometres (620  mi  and exist for no more than a couple of days  they are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather systems  polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high-latitude  operations  such as shipping and gas and oil platforms  polar lows have been referred to by many other terms  such as polar mesoscale vortex  arctic hurricane  arctic low  and cold air depression  today the term is usually reserved for the more vigorous systems that have near-surface  winds of at least 17  metres per second (38  time period in the plains where thunderstorm areas are most prevalent ranges between may and september  mesoscale convective systems develop over the region during this time frame  with a bulk of the activity occurring between 6  and 9  p m  local time  mesoscale convective systems bring 30  to 70  percent of the annual warm season rainfall to the a subset of these systems known as mesoscale convective complexes lead to up to 10%  of the annual rainfall across the plains and squall lines account for 30%  of the large thunderstorm complexes which move through the most form over the continent  some mcss form during the second half of august and september over the western mediterranean sea  mcs triggering over europe is strongly tied to mountain ranges  on average  a european mcs moves east-northeast,  forming near 3  p m  local solar time  lasts 5.5  hours  dissipating near 9  p m  lst  around 20%  of the mcss over europe do not form during maximum heating  their average maximum extent is around 9,000  square kilometres (3,500  sq convective systems  which can evolve into tropical cyclones  form along areas such as tropical waves or easterly waves which progress westward along monsoon troughs and the intertropical convergence zone in regions of ample low level moisture  convergent surface winds  and divergent winds aloft  this typically occurs north of the equator from africa across the atlantic and eastern pacific oceans  as well as across the northwest and southwest pacific oceans  from australia eastward into oceania  the indian ocean  indonesia  and from southeast brazil into the southern atlantic ocean  it is also noted on occasion in the southeast pacific ocean mild to cool enso years  outside of el more intense systems form over land than the cases of lake-effect  snow and polar lows  the convective systems form over warm water bodies when cold air sweeps over their surface and leads to an increase in moisture and significant vertical motion  this vertical motion leads to the development of showers and thunderstorms in areas of cyclonic flow on the backside of extratropical mesoscale convective vortex--(mcv)--is  a mid-level  low-pressure  center within an mcs that pulls winds into a circling pattern  or vortex  once the parent mcs dies  this vortex can persist and lead to future convective development  with a core only 30  miles (48  km  to 60  miles (97  km  and up to 8  kilometres (5.0  mi  an mcv can occasionally spawn a mesoscale surface low pressure area which appears on mesoscale surface weather analyses  but an mcv can take on a life of its own  persisting for up to several days after its parent mcs has the orphaned mcv will sometimes then become the seed of the next thunderstorm outbreak  an mcv that moves into tropical waters  such as the gulf of mexico  can serve as the nucleus for a tropical storm or
