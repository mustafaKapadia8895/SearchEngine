 english is a north sea germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval england and is now a global lingua named after the angles  one of the germanic tribes that migrated to england  it ultimately derives its name from the anglia  angeln  peninsula in the baltic sea  it is closely related to the frisian languages  but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other germanic languages  particularly norse  a north germanic language   as well as by latin and romance languages  especially has developed over the course of more than 1,400  years  the earliest forms of english  a set of anglo-frisian  dialects brought to great britain by anglo-saxon  settlers in the 5th  century  are called old english  middle english began in the late 11th  century with the norman conquest of england  and was a period in which the language was influenced by early modern english began in the late 15th  century with the introduction of the printing press to london and the king james bible  and the start of the great vowel the worldwide influence of the british empire  modern english spread around the world from the 17th  to mid-20th  centuries  through all types of printed and electronic media  as well as the emergence of the united states as a global superpower  english has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and in professional contexts such as science  navigation and is the third most widespread native language in the world  after standard chinese and it is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60  sovereign states  there are more people who have learned it as a second language than there are native speakers  english is the most commonly spoken language in the united kingdom  the united states  canada  australia  ireland and new zealand  and it is widely spoken in some areas of the caribbean  africa and south it is co-official  language of the united nations  of the european union and of many other world and regional international organisations  it is the most widely spoken germanic language  accounting for at least 70%  of speakers of this indo-european  branch  english has a vast vocabulary  and counting exactly how many words it has is english grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical indo-european  dependent marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order  to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection  a fairly fixed svo word order and a complex modern english relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses  aspect and mood  as well as passive constructions  interrogatives and some negation  despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of english used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology  and sometimes also vocabulary  grammar and spelling – english-speakers  from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease english is an indo-european  language  and belongs to the west germanic group of the germanic old english originated from a germanic tribal and linguistic continuum along the coast of the north sea  whose languages are now known as the anglo-frisian  subgroup within west germanic  as such  the modern frisian languages are the closest living relatives of modern english  low german low saxon is also closely related  and sometimes english  the frisian languages  and low german are grouped together as the ingvaeonic  though this grouping remains old english evolved into middle english  which in turn evolved into modern particular dialects of old and middle english also developed into a number of other english  anglic  languages  including and the extinct fingallian and forth and bargy  yola  dialects of icelandic and faroese  the development of english on the british isles isolated it from the continental germanic languages and influences  and has since undergone substantial evolution  english is thus not mutually intelligible with any continental germanic language  differing in vocabulary  syntax  and phonology  although some  such as dutch or frisian  do show strong affinities with english  especially with its earlier icelandic or faroese  the long history of invasions of the british isles by other peoples and languages  particularly old norse and norman french  left a profound mark of their own on the language  such that english shares substantial vocabulary and grammar similarities with many languages outside its linguistic clades  while also being unintelligible with any of those languages  some scholars have even argued that english can be considered a mixed language or a creole – a theory called the middle english creole hypothesis  although the high degree of influence from these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of modern english is widely acknowledged  most specialists in language contact do not consider english to be a true mixed is classified as a germanic language because it shares innovations with other germanic languages such as dutch  german  and these shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called proto-germanic.  some shared features of germanic languages include the use of modal verbs  the division of verbs into strong and weak classes  and the sound changes affecting proto-indo-european  consonants  known as grimm s and verner s laws  english is classified as an anglo-frisian  language because frisian and english share other features  such as the palatalisation of consonants that were velar consonants in proto-germanic   see phonological history of old english § earliest form of english is called old english or anglo-saxon   c  550–1066  ce   old english developed from a set of north sea germanic dialects originally spoken along the coasts of frisia  lower saxony  jutland  and southern sweden by germanic tribes known as the angles  saxons  and jutes  in the fifth century  the anglo-saxons  settled britain as the roman economy and administration collapsed  by the seventh century  the germanic language of the anglo-saxons  became dominant in britain  replacing the languages of roman britain (43–409  ce   common brittonic  a celtic language  and latin  brought to britain by the roman england and english  originally ænglaland and ænglisc  are named after the english was divided into four dialects  the anglian dialects  mercian and northumbrian  and the saxon dialects  kentish and west through the educational reforms of king alfred in the ninth century and the influence of the kingdom of wessex  the west saxon dialect became the standard written the epic poem beowulf is written in west saxon  and the earliest english poem  cædmon s hymn  is written in modern english developed mainly from mercian  but the scots language developed from northumbrian  a few short inscriptions from the early period of old english were written using a runic by the sixth century  a latin alphabet was adopted  written with half-uncial  letterforms  it included the runic letters wynn ⟨ƿ⟩ and thorn ⟨þ⟩  and the modified latin letters eth ⟨ð⟩  and ash english is very different from modern english and difficult for 21st-century  english speakers to understand  its grammar was similar to that of modern german  and its closest relative is old frisian  nouns  adjectives  pronouns  and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms  and word order was much freer than in modern english  modern english has case forms in pronouns  he  him  his  and a few verb endings  i have  he has   but old english had case endings in nouns as well  and verbs had more person and number translation of matthew 8:20  from 1000  ce shows examples of case endings  nominative plural  accusative plural  genitive singular  and a verb ending  present plural  in the period from the 8th  to the 12th  century  old english gradually transformed through language contact into middle english  middle english is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the conquest of england by william the conqueror in 1066,  but it developed further in the period from 1200–1450.first,  the waves of norse colonisation of northern parts of the british isles in the 8th  and 9th  centuries put old english into intense contact with old norse  a north germanic language  norse influence was strongest in the northeastern varieties of old english spoken in the danelaw area around york  which was the centre of norse colonisation  today these features are still particularly present in scots and northern english  however the centre of norsified english seems to have been in the midlands around lindsey  and after 920  ce when lindsey was reincorporated into the anglo-saxon  polity  norse features spread from there into english varieties that had not been in intense contact with norse speakers  some elements of norse influence that persist in all english varieties today are the pronouns beginning with th-   they  them  their  which replaced the anglo-saxon  pronouns with h-   hie  him  the norman conquest of england in 1066,  the now norsified old english language was subject to contact with the old norman language  a romance language closely related to modern french  the norman language in england eventually developed into anglo-norman.  because norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles  while the lower classes continued speaking anglo-saxon,  the influence of norman consisted of introducing a wide range of loanwords related to politics  legislation and prestigious social middle english also greatly simplified the inflectional system  probably in order to reconcile old norse and old english  which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar  the distinction between nominative and accusative case was lost except in personal pronouns  the instrumental case was dropped  and the use of the genitive case was limited to describing possession  the inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional and gradually simplified the system of agreement  making word order less by the wycliffe bible of the 1380s,  the passage matthew 8:20  was writtenhere the plural suffix -n  on the verb have is still retained  but none of the case endings on the nouns are present by the 12th  century middle english was fully developed  integrating both norse and norman features  it continued to be spoken until the transition to early modern english around 1500.  middle english literature includes geoffrey chaucer s the canterbury tales  and malory s le morte d arthur  in the middle english period the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated  and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as chaucer the next period in the history of english was early modern english (1500–1700).  early modern english was characterised by the great vowel shift (1350–1700),  inflectional simplification  and linguistic standardisation the great vowel shift affected the stressed long vowels of middle english  it was a chain shift  meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system  mid and open vowels were raised  and close vowels were broken into diphthongs  for example  the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today  and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today  the great vowel shift explains many irregularities in spelling  since english retains many spellings from middle english  and it also explains why english vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other began to rise in prestige during the reign of henry v  around 1430,  the court of chancery in westminster began using english in its official documents  and a new standard form of middle english  known as chancery standard  developed from the dialects of london and the east midlands  in 1476,  william caxton introduced the printing press to england and began publishing the first printed books in london  expanding the influence of this form of literature from the early modern period includes the works of william shakespeare and the translation of the bible commissioned by king james i  even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from modern english  for example  the consonant clusters  kn ɡn sw  in knight  gnat  and sword were still pronounced  many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of early modern the 1611  king james version of the bible  written in early modern english  matthew 8:20  says this exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure  replacement with subject-verb-object  word order  and the use of of instead of the non-possessive  genitive   and the introduction of loanwords from french  ayre  and word replacements  bird originally meaning  nestling  had replaced oe fugol  by the late 18th  century  the british empire had facilitated the spread of english through its colonies and geopolitical dominance  commerce  science and technology  diplomacy  art  and formal education all contributed to english becoming the first truly global language  english also facilitated worldwide international as england continued to form new colonies  these in turn became independent and developed their own norms for how to speak and write the language  english was adopted in north america  india  parts of africa  australasia  and many other regions  in the post-colonial  period  some of the newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using english as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the in the 20th  century the growing economic and cultural influence of the united states and its status as a superpower following the second world war has  along with worldwide broadcasting in english by the and other broadcasters  significantly accelerated the spread of the language across the by the 21st  century  english was more widely spoken and written than any language has ever major feature in the early development of modern english was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage  and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications  in 1755  samuel johnson published his a dictionary of the english language which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms  in 1828,  noah webster published the american dictionary of the english language in an effort to establish a norm for speaking and writing american english that was independent from the british standard  within britain  non-standard  or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised  leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle terms of grammatical evolution  modern english has now reached a stage where the loss of case is almost complete  case is now only found in pronouns  such as he and him  she and her  who and whom   and where svo word-order  is mostly some changes  such as the use of do-support  have become universalised   earlier english did not use the word  do  as a general auxiliary as modern english does  at first it was only used in question constructions where it was not now  do-support  with the verb have is becoming increasingly standardised   the use of progressive forms in -ing,  appears to be spreading to new constructions  and forms such as had been being built are becoming more common  regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues  e g  dreamed instead of dreamt   and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common  e g  more polite instead of politer   british english is also undergoing change under the influence of american english  fuelled by the strong presence of american english in the media and the prestige associated with the us as a world power  of 2016,  400  million people spoke english as their first language  and 1.1  billion spoke it as a secondary english is probably the third largest language by number of native speakers  after mandarin and however  when combining native and non-native  speakers it may  depending on the estimate used  be the most commonly spoken language in the english is spoken by communities on every continent and on oceanic islands in all the major countries in which english is spoken can be grouped into different categories by how english is used in each country  the  inner countries with many native speakers of english share an international standard of written english and jointly influence speech norms of english around the world  english does not belong to just one country  and it does not belong solely to descendants of english settlers  english is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of english  it has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world braj kachru distinguishes countries where english is spoken with a three circles in his model  the  inner circle  countries are countries with large communities of native speakers of english   outer circle  countries have small communities of native speakers of english but widespread use of english as a second language in education or broadcasting or for local official purposes  and  expanding circle  countries are countries where many learners learn english as a foreign language  kachru bases his model on the history of how english spread in different countries  how users acquire english  and the range of uses english has in each country  the three circles change membership over with large communities of native speakers of english  the inner circle  include britain  the united states  australia  canada  ireland  and new zealand  where the majority speaks english  and south africa  where a significant minority speaks english  the countries with the most native english speakers are  in descending order  the united states  at least 231  the united kingdom (60  canada (19  australia  at least 17  south africa (4.8  ireland (4.2  million   and new zealand (3.7  in these countries  children of native speakers learn english from their parents  and local people who speak other languages or new immigrants learn english to communicate in their neighbourhoods and the inner-circle  countries provide the base from which english spreads to other countries in the of the number of english speakers who are second language and foreign-language  speakers vary greatly from 470  million to more than 1,000  million depending on how proficiency is linguist david crystal estimates that non-native  speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3  to in kachru s three-circles  model  the  outer circle  countries are countries such as the india  needed   and with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of english but much use of english as a second language for education  government  or domestic business  and where english is routinely used for school instruction and official interactions with the countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an english-based  creole to a more standard version of english  they have many more speakers of english who acquire english in the process of growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting  especially if they attend schools where english is the medium of instruction  varieties of english learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to english-speaking  parents may be influenced  especially in their grammar  by the other languages spoken by those most of those varieties of english include words little used by native speakers of english in the inner-circle  and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle  varieties as well  the standard english of the inner-circle  countries is often taken as a norm for use of english in the outer-circle  the three-circles  model  countries such as poland  china  brazil  germany  japan  indonesia  egypt  and other countries where english is taught as a foreign language make up the  expanding the distinctions between english as a first language  as a second language  and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over for example  in the netherlands and some other countries of europe  knowledge of english as a second language is nearly universal  with over 80  percent of the population able to use and thus english is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education  in these countries  although english is not used for government business  its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the  outer circle  and  expanding circle   english is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of english as a second or foreign users of english in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle  so that interaction with native speakers of english plays no part in their decision to use non-native  varieties of english are widely used for international communication  and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other very often today a conversation in english anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of english at all  even while including speakers from several different chart showing the percentage of native english speakers living in  inner circle  english-speaking  countries  native speakers are now substantially outnumbered worldwide by second-language  speakers of english  not counted in this chart  english is a pluricentric language  which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the but english is not a divided despite a long-standing  joke originally attributed to george bernard shaw that the united kingdom and the united states are  two countries separated by a common spoken english  for example english used in broadcasting  generally follows national pronunciation standards that are also established by custom rather than by regulation  international broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international standard written english  the norms of standard written english are maintained purely by the consensus of educated english-speakers  around the world  without any oversight by any government or international listeners generally readily understand most british broadcasting  and british listeners readily understand most american broadcasting  most english speakers around the world can understand radio programmes  television programmes  and films from many parts of the english-speaking  both standard and nonstandard varieties of english can include both formal or informal styles  distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non-technical  settlement history of the english-speaking  inner circle countries outside britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koineised forms of english in south africa  australia  and new the majority of immigrants to the united states without british ancestry rapidly adopted english after arrival  now the majority of the united states population are monolingual english although english has been given official status by only 30  of the 50  state governments of the has ceased to be an  english language  in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically use of english is growing country-by-country  internally and for international communication  most people learn english for practical rather than ideological many speakers of english in africa have become part of an "afro-saxon"  language community that unites africans from different decolonisation proceeded throughout the british empire in the 1950s  and 1960s,  former colonies often did not reject english but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language for example  the view of the english language among many indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress  and english continues to be an official language of english is also widely used in media and literature  and the number of english language books published annually in india is the third largest in the world after the us and however english is rarely spoken as a first language  numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand  people  and less than 5%  of the population speak fluent english in david crystal claimed in 2004  that  combining native and non-native  speakers  india now has more people who speak or understand english than any other country in the but the number of english speakers in india is very uncertain  with most scholars concluding that the united states still has more speakers of english than english  sometimes described as the first global lingua is also regarded as the first world english is the world s most widely used language in newspaper publishing  book publishing  international telecommunications  scientific publishing  international trade  mass entertainment  and english is  by international treaty  the basis for the required controlled natural seaspeak and airspeak  used as international languages of and english used to have parity with french and german in scientific research  but now it dominates that it achieved parity with french as a language of diplomacy at the treaty of versailles negotiations in by the time of the foundation of the united nations at the end of world war ii  english had become pre-eminent  and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international it is one of six official languages of the united many other worldwide international organisations  including the international olympic committee  specify english as a working language or official language of the organisation many regional international organisations such as the european free trade association  association of southeast asian nations and asia-pacific  economic cooperation  apec  set english as their organisation s sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native english speakers  while the european union  eu  allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the union  in practice english is the main working language of eu in most countries english is not an official language  it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign in the countries of the eu  english is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five  member states where it is not an official language  that is  the countries other than the uk  ireland and malta   in a 2012  official eurobarometer poll  38  percent of the eu respondents outside the countries where english is an official language said they could speak english well enough to have a conversation in that language  the next most commonly mentioned foreign language  french  which is the most widely known foreign language in the uk and ireland   could be used in conversation by 12  percent of working knowledge of english has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as and computing  english has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80  percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by chemical abstracts in 1998  were written in english  as were 90  percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996  and 82  percent of articles in humanities publications by subsets of english arise spontaneously in international communities  for example  among international business people  as an auxiliary language  this has led some scholars to develop the study of english as an auxiliary languages  globish uses a relatively small subset of english vocabulary  about 1500  words with highest use in international business english  in combination with the standard english grammar  other examples include simple english the increased use of the english language globally has had an effect on other languages  leading to some english words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages  this influence of english has led to concerns about language and to claims of linguistic and has provoked resistance to the spread of english  however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that english provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved some scholars mention a possibility of future divergence of english dialects into mutually unintelligible languages  most think a more likely outcome is that english will continue to function as a koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the english is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the thus english has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language  including phonetics and phonology of the english language differ from one dialect to another  usually without interfering with mutual communication  phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes  i e  speech sounds that distinguish meaning   and phonetic variation is differences in pronunciation of the phonemes  this overview mainly describes the standard pronunciations of the united kingdom and the united states  received pronunciation  rp  and general american  ga   see section below on  dialects  accents and varieties   the phonetic symbols used below are from the international phonetic alphabet english dialects share the same 24  consonant phonemes  the consonant inventory shown below is valid for californian american and for conventionally transcribed  r  in the table  when obstruents  stops  affricates  and fricatives  appear in pairs  such as  p b    tʃ dʒ   and  s z   the first is fortis  strong  and the second is lenis  weak   fortis obstruents  such as  p tʃ s  are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants  such as  b dʒ z   and are always voiceless  lenis consonants are partly voiced at the beginning and end of utterances  and fully voiced between vowels  fortis stops such as  p  have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects  they are aspirated when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable  often unaspirated in other cases  and often unreleased   or pre-glottalised  at the end of a syllable  in a single-syllable  word  a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened  thus nip has a noticeably shorter vowel  phonetically  but not phonemically  than nib  see rp  the lateral approximant  l   has two main allophones  pronunciation variants   the clear or plain as in light  and the dark or velarised as in ga has dark l in most sonorants  liquids  l  r  and nasals  m  n  ŋ   devoice when following a voiceless obstruent  and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker s accent  the table below lists the vowel phonemes in received pronunciation  rp  and general american  ga   with examples of words in which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists  the vowels are represented with symbols from the international phonetic alphabet  those given for rp are standard in british dictionaries and other publications in rp  vowel length is phonemic  long vowels are marked with a triangular colon ⟨ː⟩ in the table above  such as the vowel of need as opposed to bid ga does not have long vowels in both rp and ga  vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable  like  t tʃ f   but not before lenis consonants like  d dʒ v  or in open syllables  thus  the vowels of rich neat and safe are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ridge need and save and the vowel of light is shorter than that of lie because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable  vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or vowels  ɨ ə  only occur in unstressed syllables and are a result of vowel reduction  some dialects do not distinguish them  so that roses and comma end in the same vowel  a dialect feature called weak-vowel  merger  ga has an unstressed r-coloured  schwa  ɚ   as in butter which in rp has the same vowel as the word-final  vowel in comma an english syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound  syllable onset and coda  start and end  are optional  a syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds  as in sprint  sprɪnt   and end with up to four  as in texts  teksts   this gives an english syllable the following structure   ccc v cccc  where c represents a consonant and v a vowel  the word strengths  strɛŋkθs  is thus an example of the most complex syllable possible in english  the consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted  as is the order in which they may appear  onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters  a stop and approximant  as in play  a voiceless fricative and approximant  as in fly or sly  s and a voiceless stop  as in stay  and s  a voiceless stop  and an approximant  as in clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas  clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing  and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited  furthermore  several consonants have limited distributions   h  can only occur in syllable initial position  and  ŋ  only in syllable final plays an important role in english  certain syllables are stressed  while others are unstressed  stress is a combination of duration  intensity  vowel quality  and sometimes changes in pitch  stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables  and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are some words  primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can  have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed  position within a sentence stress in english is phonemic  and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress  for instance  the word contract is stressed on the first syllable   ˈkɒntrækt  kon-trakt)  when used as a noun  but on the last syllable   kənˈtrækt  kən-trakt)  for most meanings  for example   reduce in size   when used as a here stress is connected to vowel reduction  in the noun  contract  the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel  ɒ   but in the verb  contract  the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to  ə   stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases  so that a compound word receives a single stress unit  but the corresponding phrase has two  e g  to búrn óut versus a búrnout  and a hótdog versus a hót terms of rhythm  english is generally described as a stress-timed  language  meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal  stressed syllables are pronounced longer  but unstressed syllables  syllables between stresses  are shortened  vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well  and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality  vowel reduction varieties of english vary the most in pronunciation of vowels  the best known national varieties used as standards for education in non english-speaking  countries are british  bre  and american  ame   countries such as canada  australia  ireland  new zealand and south africa have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally  some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table  varieties of standard english and their has undergone many historical sound changes  some of them affecting all varieties  and others affecting only a few  most standard varieties are affected by the great vowel shift  which changed the pronunciation of long vowels  but a few dialects have slightly different results  in north america  a number of chain shifts such as the northern cities vowel shift and canadian shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phones than the standard varieties  some conservative varieties like scottish english have a voiceless sound in whine that contrasts with the voiced in wine  but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced a dialect feature called wine–whine merger  the unvoiced velar fricative sound  x  is found in scottish english  which distinguishes loch  lɔx  from lock  lɔk   accents like cockney with "h-dropping"  lack the glottal fricative  h   and dialects with th-stopping  and th-fronting  like african american vernacular and estuary english do not have the dental fricatives  θ  ð   but replace them with dental or alveolar stops  t  d  or labiodental fricatives  f  other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as yod-dropping,  yod-coalescence,  and reduction of consonant clusters general american and received pronunciation vary in their pronunciation of historical  r  after a vowel at the end of a syllable  in the syllable coda   ga is a rhotic dialect  meaning that it pronounces  r  at the end of a syllable  but rp is non-rhotic,  meaning that it loses  r  in that position  english dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic  depending on whether they elide  r  like rp or keep it like is complex dialectal variation in words with the open front and open back vowels  æ ɑː ɒ ɔː   these four vowels are only distinguished in rp  australia  new zealand and south africa  in ga  these vowels merge to three  æ ɑ and in canadian english they merge to two  æ in addition  the words that have each vowel vary by dialect  the table  dialects and open vowels  shows this variation with lexical sets in which these sounds occur as is typical of an indo-european  language  english follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment  unlike other indo-european  languages though  english has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions  only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class  english distinguishes at least seven major word classes  verbs  nouns  adjectives  adverbs  determiners  including articles   prepositions  and conjunctions  some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns  and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators  and add the class of english also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs  such as have and do  expressing the categories of mood and aspect  questions are marked by do-support,  wh-movement   fronting of question words beginning with wh-)  and word order inversion with some verbs some traits typical of germanic languages persist in english  such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut  i e  changing the vowel of the stem  as in the pairs speak spoke and foot feet  and weak stems inflected through affixation  such as love loved  hand hands   vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system  he him  who whom  and in the inflection of the copula verb to be the seven word classes are exemplified in this sample nouns are only inflected for number and possession  new nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding  they are semantically divided into proper nouns  names  and common nouns  common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns  and grammatically into count nouns and mass count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix -s,  but a few nouns have irregular plural forms  mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier  e g  one loaf of bread  two loaves of plural formation irregular plural formation possession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic -s   also traditionally called a genitive suffix   or by the preposition of  historically the -s  possessive has been used for animate nouns  whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns  today this distinction is less clear  and many speakers use -s  also with inanimates  orthographically the possessive -s  is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe possessive constructions nouns can form noun phrases  nps  where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners  quantifiers  conjunctions or noun phrases can be short  such as the man  composed only of a determiner and a noun  they can also include modifiers such as adjectives  e g  red  tall  all  and specifiers such as determiners  e g  the  that   but they can also tie together several nouns into a single long np  using conjunctions such as and  or prepositions such as with  e g  the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles  this np uses conjunctions  prepositions  specifiers and modifiers   regardless of length  an np functions as a syntactic unit  for example  the possessive enclitic can  in cases which do not lead to ambiguity  follow the entire noun phrase  as in the president of india s wife  where the enclitic follows india and not president the class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness  where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one  a definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor  whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known  quantifiers  which include one  many  some and all  are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number  the noun must agree with the number of the determiner  e g  one man  sg   but all men  pl    determiners are the first constituents in a noun modify a noun by providing additional information about their referents  in english  adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after in modern english  adjectives are not inflected  and they do not agree in form with the noun they modify  as adjectives in most other indo-european  languages do  for example  in the phrases the slender boy  and many slender girls  the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun some adjectives are inflected for degree of comparison  with the positive degree unmarked  the suffix -er  marking the comparative  and -est  marking the superlative  a small boy  the boy is smaller than the girl  that boy is the smallest  some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms  such as good  better  and best  other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions  with the adverb more marking the comparative  and most marking the superlative  happier or more happy  the happiest or most there is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison  and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection  the personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons  i me  he him  she her  we us  they them  as well as a gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular  distinguishing he she it   the subjective case corresponds to the old english nominative case  and the objective case is used both in the sense of the previous accusative case  in the role of patient  or direct object of a transitive verb   and in the sense of the old english dative case  in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause  and otherwise the objective case is while grammarians such as henry and otto noted that the english cases did not correspond to the traditional latin based system  some contemporary grammars  for example huddleston   pullum (2002),  retain traditional labels for the cases  calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms  the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun  as in my chair   while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun  e g  the chair is the english system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address  and the forms for 2nd  person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form  some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd  person plural pronouns such as y all found in southern american english and african american  vernacular  english or youse and ye found in irish english pronouns are used to refer to entities deictically or anaphorically  a deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation — for example the pronoun i identifies the speaker  and the pronoun you  the addressee  anaphorical pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience  for example in the sentence i already told you that  the reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase  e g   he sent it to himself  or  she braced herself for phrases  pp  are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns  e g  with the dog  for my friend  to school  in england  prepositions have a wide range of uses in english  they are used to describe movement  place  and other relations between different entities  but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs  for example  in the phrase i gave it to him  the preposition to marks the recipient  or indirect object of the verb to give  traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded  for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form   with her    to me    for us   but some contemporary grammars such as that of huddleston   pullum (2002:598–600)  no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions  rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases english verbs are inflected for tense and aspect  and marked for agreement with third person singular subject  only the copula verb to be is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive  past  or progressive forms  they form complex tenses  aspects  and moods  auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation  and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question verbs have six inflectional forms  the primary forms are a plain present  a third person singular present  and a preterite  past  form  the secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive  a gerund–participle and a past the copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation  and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject  the first person present tense form is am  the third person singular form is and the form are is used second person singular and all three plurals  the only verb past participle is been and its gerund-participle  is being english has two primary tenses  past  preterit  and non-past.  the preterit is inflected by using the preterit form of the verb  which for the regular verbs includes the suffix -ed,  and for the strong verbs either the suffix -t  or a change in the stem vowel  the non-past  form is unmarked except in the third person singular  which takes the suffix does not have a morphologised future futurity of action is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs will or many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb be going aspectual distinctions are encoded by the use of auxiliary verbs  primarily have and be  which encode the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect  past tense  i have run vs  i was running   and compound tenses such as preterite perfect  i had been running  and present perfect  i have been the expression of mood  english uses a number of modal auxiliaries  such as can  may  will  shall and the past tense forms could  might  would  should  there is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood  both based on the plain form of the verb  i e  without the third person singular -s),  and which is used in subordinate clauses  e g  subjunctive  it is important that he run every day  imperative infinitive form  that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to  is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause  finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterit form  in clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause  for example  he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive  or in a complement clause such as i saw him leave  where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form  and leave is in the infinitive english also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs  verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb  the phrase then functions as a single predicate  in terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb  but in writing it is written as a separate word  examples of phrasal verbs are to get up  to ask out  to back up  to give up  to get together  to hang out  to put up with  etc  the phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement  e g  lay off meaning terminate someone s in spite of the idiomatic meaning  some grammarians  including huddleston   pullum (2002):274,  do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term  phrasal verb   instead they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement  i e  he woke up in the morning and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent the function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs  many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly,  but not all  and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs  for example  in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman s way of walking  some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms  such as good which has the adverbial form well modern english syntax language is moderately it has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning  auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions  negative polarity  the passive voice and progressive aspect english word order has moved from the germanic verb-second  (v2)  word order to being almost exclusively subject–verb–object the combination of svo order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence  such as he had hoped to try to open it in most sentences english only marks grammatical relations through word the subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it  the example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent is marked only by the position relative to the verb an exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun  in which case it is doubly marked  both by word order and by case inflection  where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form  and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form  the example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject is represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun indirect objects  io  of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction  s v io o   such as i gave jane the book or in a prepositional phrase  such as i gave the book to jane english a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses  that may in turn be composed of one or more phrases  e g  noun phrases  verb phrases  and prepositional phrases   a clause is built around a verb  and includes its constituents  such as any nps and pps  within a sentence one clause is always the main clause  or matrix clause  whereas other clauses are subordinate to it  subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause  for example  in the phrase i think  that  you are lying  the main clause is headed by the verb think  the subject is i  but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause  that  you are lying  the subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause  but it is often relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause  for example  in the sentence i saw the letter that you received today  the relative clause that you received today specifies the meaning of the word letter  the object of the main clause  relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who  whose  whom and which as well as by that  which can also be in contrast to many other germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense  aspect and mood  auxiliary verbs form main clauses  and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb  for example  in the sentence the dog did not find its bone  the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not  subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions  including focus  negation  and interrogative constructions the verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences  where it usually serves to add emphasis  as in  i did shut the fridge   however  in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above  it is used because the rules of english syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present  modern english does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb  as in  i know not—it can only be added to an auxiliary  or copular  verb  hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required  the auxiliary do is used  to produce a form like i do not  don t  know  the same applies in clauses requiring inversion  including most questions—inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb  so it is not possible to say  know you him   grammatical rules require do you know is done with the adverb not  which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb  a contracted form of not -n't  can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be  just as with questions  many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support,  thus in modern english i don t know him is the correct answer to the question do you know him   but not  i know him not  although this construction may be found in older constructions also use auxiliary verbs  a passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase  and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase  they are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get  although not all varieties of english allow the use of passives with get  for example  putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen  by her   or he gets seen  by yes–no questions and wh-questions  in english are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion  am i going tomorrow   where can we eat    which may require do-support   do you like her   where did he go    in most cases  interrogative words (wh-words;  e g  what  who  where  when  why  how  appear in a fronted position  for example  in the question what did you see   the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence   when the wh-word  is the subject or forms part of the subject  no inversion occurs  who saw the cat    prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question s theme  e g  to whose house did you go last night   the personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case  with the variant whom serving as the objective case form  although this form may be going out of use in many english is a subject-prominent  language  at the discourse level it tends to use a topic-comment  structure  where the known information  topic  precedes the new information  comment   because of the strict svo syntax  the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence  in cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence  frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means  one way of doing this is through a passive construction  the girl was stung by the bee  another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there  e g  it was the girl that the bee stung  there was a girl who was stung by a dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs  e g   it is raining  or in existential clauses  there are many cars on the street   through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects  english is able to maintain both a topic-comment  sentence structure and a svo syntax focus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence  generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent  for example  the girl was stung by a bee  emphasising it was a bee and not for example a wasp that stung her   or the girl was stung by a bee  contrasting with another possibility  for example that it was the topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation  either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause  for example  that girl over there  she was stung by a bee  emphasises the girl by preposition  but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition  she was stung by a bee  that girl over there  where reference to the girl is established as an between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora  e g  that is exactly what i mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors  or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated discourse markers such as oh  so or well  also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion  discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences  discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said  for example  no way is that true   the idiomatic marker no way  expressing disbelief   or boy  i m hungry  the marker boy expressing emphasis   while discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of english  they are also used in written and formal is an immensely rich language in terms of vocabulary  containing more synonyms than any other there are words which appear on the surface to mean exactly the same thing but which  in fact  have a slightly different shade of meaning and must be used appropriately if a speaker wants to convey precisely the message they intend to it is generally stated that english has around 170,000  words  or 220,000  if obsolete words are counted  this estimate is based on the last full edition of the oxford english dictionary from over half of these words are nouns  a quarter adjectives and a seventh verbs  there is one count that puts the english vocabulary at about 1  million words – but that count presumably includes words such as latin species names  scientific terminology  prefixed and suffixed words  jargon  foreign words of extremely limited english use and technical to its status an international language  english is expeditious when it comes adopting foreign words  and borrows vocabulary from a large number of other sources  early studies of english vocabulary by lexicographers  the scholars who formally study vocabulary  compile dictionaries  or both  were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality  linguistic collections of actual written texts and spoken passages  many statements published before the end of the 20th  century about the growth of english vocabulary over time  the dates of first use of various words in english  and the sources of english vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes  one of the most productive processes in english is using a word with a different grammatical role  for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun  another productive word-formation  process is nominal producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or a process more common in old english than in modern english  but still productive in modern english  is the use of derivational suffixes (-hood,  -ness,  -ing,  -ility)  to derive new words from existing words  especially those of germanic origin  or stems  especially for words of latin or greek origin  formation of new words  called neologisms  based on greek or latin roots  for example television or optometry  is a highly productive process in english and in most modern european languages  so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated  for this reason  lexicographer philip gove attributed many such words to the  international scientific vocabulary   isv  when compiling webster s third new international dictionary (1961).  another active word-formation  process in english is words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases  e g  nato  laser  english  besides forming new words from existing words and their roots  also borrows words from other languages  this process of adding words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages  but english is characterised as being especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000  the most commonly used words in english are west the words in english learned first by children as they learn to speak  particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts  are the germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of old one of the consequences of long language contact between french and english in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of english has a very high percentage of  latinate  words  derived from french  especially  and also from latin or from other romance languages   french words from various periods of the development of french now make up one-third  of the vocabulary of words of old norse origin have entered the english language primarily from the contact between old norse and old english during colonisation of eastern and northern england  many of these words are part of english core vocabulary  such as egg or has also borrowed many words directly from latin  the ancestor of the romance languages  during all stages of its many of these words were earlier borrowed into latin from greek  latin or greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences  philosophy  and english continues to gain new loanwords and calques   loan translations   from languages all over the world  and words from languages other than the ancestral anglo-saxon  language make up about 60  percent of the vocabulary of has formal and informal speech registers  and informal registers  including child directed speech  tend to be made up predominantly of words of anglo-saxon  origin  while the percentage of vocabulary that is of latinate origin is higher in legal  scientific  and academic has a strong influence on the vocabulary of other the influence of english comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the english language  the role of english as a world lingua franca  and the large number of books and films that are translated from english into other that pervasive use of english leads to a conclusion in many places that english is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies  among varieties of english  it is especially american english that influences other some languages  such as chinese  write words borrowed from english mostly as calques  while others  such as japanese  readily take in english loanwords written in sound-indicating  dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of english influence on languages in the ninth century  english has been written in a latin alphabet  also called roman alphabet   earlier old english texts in anglo-saxon  runes are only short inscriptions  the great majority of literary works in old english that survive to today are written in the roman the modern english alphabet contains 26  letters of the latin script  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z  which also have capital forms  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z  the spelling system  or orthography  of english is multi-layered,  with elements of french  latin  and greek spelling on top of the native germanic further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept compared to european languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms  english has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is there are also systematic spelling differences between british and american english  these situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one  correspondence in standard english spelling  spelling rules that take into account syllable structure  phonetic changes in derived words  and word accent are reliable for most english moreover  standard english spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling  for example the words photograph  photography  and or the words electricity and electrical  while few scholars agree with chomsky and halle (1968)  that conventional english orthography is there is a rationale for current english spelling the standard orthography of english is the most widely used writing system in the standard english spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each of english can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds  the letters b  d  f  h  j  k  l  m  n  p  r  s  t  v  w  y  z represent  respectively  the phonemes  b  d  f  h  dʒ  k  l  m  n  p  r  s  t  v  w  j  z   the letters c and g normally represent  k  and  ɡ   but there is also a soft c pronounced  s   and a soft g pronounced  dʒ   the differences in the pronunciations of the letters c and g are often signalled by the following letters in standard english spelling  digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for  tʃ   sh for  ʃ   th for  θ  or  ð   ng for  ŋ   qu for  kw   and ph for  f  in greek-derived  words  the single letter x is generally pronounced as  z  in word-initial  position and as  ks  otherwise  there are exceptions to these generalisations  often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of or proposals by pedantic scholars in the early period of modern english to mistakenly follow the spelling patterns of latin for english words of germanic the vowel sounds of the english language  however  correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular  there are many more vowel phonemes in english than there are vowel letters  a  e  i  o  u  w  y   as a result of a smaller set of single letter symbols than the set of vowel phonemes  some  long vowels  are often indicated by combinations of letters  like the oa in boat  the ow in how  and the ay in stay   or the historically based silent e  as in note and consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in english  it can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of english than of many other languages  including italian  spanish  or nonetheless  there is an advantage for learners of english reading in learning the specific sound-symbol  regularities that occur in the standard english spellings of commonly used such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in english may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write writing also includes a system of punctuation that is similar to the system of punctuation marks used in most alphabetic languages around the world  the purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text identify many english dialects  which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar  vocabulary  and pronunciation  the pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents  the major native dialects of english are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of british english  bre  and north american english there also exists a third common major grouping of english varieties  southern hemisphere english  the most prominent being australian and new zealand english as the place where english first evolved  the british isles  and particularly england  are home to the most diverse dialects  within the united kingdom  the received pronunciation  rp   an educated dialect of south east england  is traditionally used as the broadcast standard  and is considered the most prestigious of the british dialects  the spread of rp  also known as bbc english  through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural england to recede  as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects  at the time of the survey of english dialects  grammar and vocabulary differed across the country  but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary  and in fact only 3  percent of the english population actually speak rp  the remainder speaking regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of rp there is also variability within rp  particularly along class lines between upper and middle class rp speakers and between native rp speakers and speakers who adopt rp later in within britain there is also considerable variation along lines of social class  and some traits though exceedingly common are considered "non-standard"  and are associated with lower class speakers and identities  an example of this is h-dropping,  which was historically a feature of lower class london english  particularly cockney  and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of england — yet it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of british in england can be divided into four major dialect regions  southwest english  south east english  midlands english  and northern english  within each of these regions several local subdialects exist  within the northern region  there is a division between the yorkshire dialects  and the geordie dialect spoken in northumbria around newcastle  and the lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in liverpool  scouse  and manchester  mancunian   having been the centre of danish occupation during the viking invasions  northern english dialects  particularly the yorkshire dialect  retain norse features not found in other english the 15th  century  southeastern england varieties centred around london  which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects  in london  the cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes  and it was long a socially stigmatised variety  the spread of cockney features across the south-east  led the media to talk of estuary english as a new dialect  but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that london had influencing neighbouring regions throughout traits that have spread from london in recent decades include the use of intrusive r  drawing is pronounced drawring  ˈdrɔːrɪŋ    t-glottalisation   potter is pronounced with a glottal stop as po er  poʔʌ    and the pronunciation of th-  as  f   thanks pronounced fanks  or  v   bother pronounced bover   is today considered a separate language from english  but it has its origins in early northern middle and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources  particularly scots gaelic and old norse  scots itself has a number of regional dialects  and in addition to scots  scottish english are the varieties of standard english spoken in scotland  most varieties are northern english accents  with some influence from ireland  various forms of english have been spoken since the norman invasions of the 11th  century  in county wexford  in the area surrounding dublin  two extinct dialects known as forth and bargy and fingallian developed as offshoots from early middle english  and were spoken until the 19th  century  modern irish english  however has its roots in english colonisation in the 17th  century  today irish english is divided into ulster english  the northern ireland dialect with strong influence from scots  as well as various dialects of the republic of ireland  like scottish and most north american accents  almost all irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in the dialects influenced by english is fairly homogeneous compared to british english  today  american accent variation is often increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local though most americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar known collectively as general american  ga   with differences hardly noticed even among americans themselves  such as midland and western american in most american

coastal northeast  famously including eastern new england english and new york city english   and african american vernacular english  all of which are historically non-rhotic.  canadian english  except for the atlantic provinces and perhaps quebec  may be classified under ga as well  but it often shows raising of certain vowels   aɪ  and  aʊ   before voiceless consonants  as well as distinct norms for written and pronunciation southern american english  the largest american  accent group  outside of rhoticity now strongly prevails  replacing the region s historical non-rhotic  southern accents are colloquially described as a  drawl  or being recognised most readily by the southern vowel shift that begins with glide-deleting  in the  aɪ  vowel  e g  pronouncing spy almost like spa   the  southern breaking  of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables  e g  pronouncing the word  press  almost like the pin–pen merger  and other distinctive phonological  grammatical  and lexical features  many of which are actually recent developments of the 19th  century or spoken primarily by working-  and middle-class  african americans  african american vernacular english  aave  is also largely non-rhotic  and likely originated among enslaved africans and african americans influenced primarily by the non-rhotic,  non-standard  english dialects of the old south  a minority of contrarily  propose that aave mostly traces back to african languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or creole english to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic aave shares important commonalities with older southern american english and so probably developed to a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th  or early 20th  century  aave is commonly stigmatised in north america as a form of  broken  or  uneducated  english  also common of modern southern american english  but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of english with their own norms shared by a large speech 1788,  english has been spoken in oceania  and australian english has developed as a first language of the vast majority of the inhabitants of the australian continent  its standard accent being general australian  the english of neighbouring new zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the australian and new zealand english are each other s closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics  followed by south african english and the english of southeastern england  all of which have similarly non-rhotic  accents  aside from some accents in the south island of new zealand  australian and new zealand english stand out for their innovative vowels  many short vowels are fronted or raised  whereas many long vowels have diphthongised  australian english also has a contrast between long and short vowels  not found in most other varieties  australian english grammar aligns closely to british and american english  like american english  collective plural subjects take on a singular verb  as in the government is rather than new zealand english uses front vowels that are often even

afrikaans and various african languages such as the khoe and bantu languages  today about 9  percent of the south african population speak south african english  sae  as a first language  sae is a non-rhotic  variety  which tends to follow rp as a norm  it is alone among non-rhotic  varieties in lacking intrusive r  there are different l2  varieties that differ based on the native language of the most phonological differences from rp are in the consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce  p  t  t͡ʃ  k  without aspiration  e g  pin pronounced rather than as as in most other varieties   while r is often pronounced as a flap instead of as the more common varieties of english are also spoken in the caribbean islands that were colonial possessions of britain  including jamaica  and the leeward and windward islands and trinidad and tobago  barbados  the cayman islands  and belize  each of these areas are home both to a local variety of english and a local english based creole  combining english and african languages  the most prominent varieties are jamaican english and jamaican creole  in central america  english based creoles are spoken in on the caribbean coasts of nicaragua and locals are often fluent both in the local english variety and the local creole languages and code-switching  between them is frequent  indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between creole and standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the creole forms serving as  basilect  and the more rp-like  forms serving as the  acrolect   the most formal caribbean varieties are based on british english and consequently most are non-rhotic,  except for formal styles of jamaican english which are often rhotic  jamaican english differs from rp in its vowel inventory  which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in standard english  the diphthongs  ei  and  ou  are monophthongs and or even the reverse diphthongs and  e g  bay and boat pronounced and often word final consonant clusters are simplified so that  child  is pronounced and  wind  a historical legacy  indian english tends to take rp as its ideal  and how well this ideal is realised in an individual s speech reflects class distinctions among indian english speakers  indian english accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as  t  and  d   often pronounced with retroflex articulation as and and the replacement of  θ  and  ð  with dentals and sometimes indian english speakers may also use spelling based pronunciations where the silent ⟨h⟩ found in words such as ghost is pronounced as an indian voiced aspirated stop on a coloured area to see an article about english in that country or region
