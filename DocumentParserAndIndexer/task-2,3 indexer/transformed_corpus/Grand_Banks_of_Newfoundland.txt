 the grand banks of newfoundland are a group of underwater plateaus south-east  of newfoundland on the north american continental shelf  these areas are relatively shallow  ranging from 50  to 300  feet (15  to 91  m  in depth  the cold labrador current mixes with the warm waters of the gulf stream here the mixing of these waters and the shape of the ocean bottom lifts nutrients to the surface  these conditions helped to create one of the richest fishing grounds in the world  fish species include atlantic cod  swordfish  haddock and capelin  shellfish include scallop and lobster  the area also supports large colonies of seabirds such as northern gannets  shearwaters and sea ducks and various sea mammals such as seals  dolphins and whales in addition to the effects on nutrients  the mixing of the cold and warm currents often causes fog in the area  it is also noted for its proximity to the sinking of the rms titanic and thus the launching point of titanic shipwreck expeditions the grand banks were extensively glaciated during the last glacial maximum  by approximately 13,000  years ago  the majority of the ice had melted  leaving the grand banks exposed as several islands extending for hundreds of kilometers  it is believed that rising sea levels submerged these around 8,000  years there is no archaeological evidence for a european presence near the grand banks between the short-lived  greenland norse settlement at l anse aux meadows in ce 1000  and john cabot s transatlantic crossing in 1497,  there is some evidence that voyagers from the basque the 15th  century some texts refer to a land called bacalao  the land of the codfish  which is possibly newfoundland  within a few years of cabot s voyage the existence of fishing grounds on the grand banks became generally known in europe  ships from france and portugal were first to fish there  followed by those from spain while ships from england were scarce in the early this soon changed especially after bernard drake s devastating raid in 1585  which virtually wiped out the spanish and portuguese fishing industry in this these fish stocks thus became important for the early economies of eastern canada and new england on 18  november 1929,  a major earthquake  known as the 1929  grand banks earthquake  on the southwestern part of the grand banks bordering the laurentian channel caused an underwater landslide which resulted in extensive damage to transatlantic cables and generated a rare atlantic tsunami that struck the south coast of newfoundland and eastern cape breton island  claiming 28  lives in the burin peninsula technological advances in fishing such as large factory ships and sonar  as well as geopolitical disputes over territorial sea and exclusive economic zone  eez  boundaries  have led to overfishing and a serious decline in the fish stocks of the grand banks from around 1990.canada's  eez currently occupies the majority of the grand banks except for the lucrative  nose   eastern extremity  near the flemish cap  and  tail   southern extremity  of the fishing bank  the 1783  treaty of paris gave the united states shared rights to fish in these waters  but that section of the treaty is no longer in force  the french territory saint pierre and miquelon exclusive economic zone occupies a pin-shaped  section at the west edge of the grand banks  with the 22  km radius head of the pin surrounding the islands and the needle heading south for 348  km canada is currently performing the hydrographic and geological surveys necessary for claiming the entire continental shelf off eastern canada  under the auspices of the latest united nations convention on the law of the sea  once this aspect of unclos is ratified  canada will presumably control these remaining parts of grand banks which are outside of its eez jurisdiction petroleum reserves have also been discovered and a number of oil fields are under development in this region  most notably the hibernia  terra nova  and white rose projects  the harsh environment on the grand banks also led to the ocean ranger disaster.semi-fictional  depictions of fishermen working on the grand banks can be found in rudyard kipling s novel captains courageous (1897)  and in sebastian junger s non-fiction  book the perfect storm (1997).  the grand banks are also portrayed in the 1990  film the hunt for red october coordinates  45°14′13″n  50°59′21.2″w﻿    ﻿45.23694°n  50.989222°w﻿    45.23694;  -50.989222
