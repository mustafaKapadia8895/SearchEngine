 paul s  martin  born in allentown  pennsylvania  1928  -  died in tucson  arizona september 13,  was an american geoscientist at the university of arizona who developed the theory that the pleistocene extinction of large mammals worldwide was caused by overhunting by humans  martin s work bridged the fields of ecology  anthropology  geosciences  and paleontology in 1953,  martin received his bachelor s degree in zoology from cornell university  in 1953  and 1956  he completed his master s and doctorate programs at the university of michigan and then proceeded with postdoctoral research at the yale university and the university of montreal  he joined the faculty of the university of arizona in 1957  and worked there until his retirement in a case of polio  contracted while doing undergraduate field work in mexico  forced martin to rely on a cane  which restricted but did not end his field developed the theory known as “overkill” or the “blitzkrieg based on the ideas of a russian climatologist mikhaill i  budyko about the sudden demise of large ice age mammal populations on different continents and at different times coincided with the arrival of humans  he believed that as they migrated from africa and eurasia to australia  the americas  and the islands of the pacific  humans rapidly hunted the large animals endemic to each continent to extinction  martin particularly focused his research on north america  whose late ice age fauna rivaled that of africa but the ideas was first developed by m  budyko to explain mammoth extinction in europe and asia  because m i  budyko published his work in a russian journal and during the cold war in 1967,  most north american scholars ignored budyko s he theorized  around 11,000  years ago  newly arriving humans hunted north america s ice age big game  including ground sloths  camels  mammoths and mastodons  to the theory  summarized in twilight of the mammoths  ice age extinctions and the rewilding of america (2005)  has been widely discussed and remained controversial  critic michael fosha wrote that although martin attempted to discuss and debunk alternative explanations of the extinction  he did not adequately examine mainstream theories like changes in climate and vegetation  according to fosha  martin presented a vivid account of prehistoric people s assault on nature  with the efficiency of a german panzer division  but fosha felt that his views on archaeology were inaccurate  however  fosha wrote that the book presents  excellent data on the southwest  and deserves serious attention for sometimes faced criticism from archaeologists and paleontologists who claimed earlier dates for human arrival in the americas or later dates for certain extinct animals than the overkill theory would suggest  martin maintained that such claims were the result of faulty scientific analysis and pointed out that no such dates had yet been independently over-hunting  hypothesis is still controversial  several pre-clovis  sites are accepted by most workers  such as topper  monte verde  paisley caves and others  dating of these is still controversial  new research has shown that in siberia mammoths lived together with human beings for around 30,000  years  yet they became extinct only when the last glacial age ended  in madagascar there are more studies that predates the human arrival in the isle of several martin s overkill model was nevertheless confirmed in new zealand  with the demise of the moa  and other smaller islands  with the extinction of many species like the dodo and hundreds of insular other needed martin also championed the concept of “rewilding”  or “resurrection ecology” in which extinct n  american pleistocene fauna could be restored by establishing breeding populations of surviving animals from other continents  llamas  camels  lions and cheetahs  and introducing populations of animals analogous to extinct species  i e   elephants for to vance haynes   unlike so many people who get infatuated with their own theories  he spent his professional career inviting criticism  he put together two critical conferences about pleistocene extinctions  and the volumes that came out of those were
