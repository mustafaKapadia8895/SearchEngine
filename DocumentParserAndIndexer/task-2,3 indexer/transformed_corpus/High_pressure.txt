 high pressure in science and engineering is studying the effects of high pressure on materials and the design and construction of devices  such as a diamond anvil cell  which can create high pressure  by high pressure it is usually meant pressures of thousands  kilobars  or millions  megabars  of times atmospheric pressure  about 1  bar or 100,000  pa  percy williams bridgman received a nobel prize in 1946  for advancing this area of physics by several magnitudes of pressure (400  mpa to 40,000  mpa   the list of founding fathers of this field includes also the names of harry george drickamer  tracy hall  francis p  bundy  leonid f  vereschagin  and sergey m  stishov it was by applying high pressure as well as high temperature to carbon that man-made  diamonds were first produced as well as many other interesting discoveries  almost any material when subjected to high pressure will compact itself into a denser form  for example  quartz  also called silica or silicon dioxide will first adopt a denser form known as coesite  then upon application of even higher pressure  form stishovite  these two forms of silica were first discovered by high-pressure  experimenters  but then found in nature at the site of a meteor impact chemical bonding is likely to change under high pressure  when the p v term in the free energy becomes comparable to the energies of typical chemical bonds -  i e  at around 100  gpa  among the most striking changes are metallization of oxygen at 96  gpa  rendering oxygen a superconductor   and transition of sodium from a nearly-free-electron  metal to a transparent insulator at ~200  gpa  at ultimately high compression  however  all materials will experimentation has led to the discovery of the types of minerals which are believed to exist in the deep mantle of the earth  such as silicate perovskite  which is thought to make up half of the earth s bulk  and post-perovskite,  which occurs at the core-mantle  boundary and explains many anomalies inferred for that needed pressure  landmarks   typical pressures reached by large-volume  presses are up to 30-40  gpa  pressures that can be generated inside diamond anvil cells are ~1000  pressure in the center of the earth is 364  gpa  and highest pressures ever achieved in shock waves are over 100,000
