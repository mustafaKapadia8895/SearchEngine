 greek  modern greek  ελληνικά elliniká   greek   ελληνική γλώσσα ˈɣlosa    listen   ellinikí glóssa   greek language   is an independent branch of the indo-european  family of languages  native to greece and other parts of the eastern mediterranean  it has the longest documented history of any living indo-european  language  spanning 34  centuries of written its writing system has been the greek alphabet for the major part of its history  other systems  such as linear b and the cypriot syllabary  were used the alphabet arose from the phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the latin  cyrillic  armenian  coptic  gothic and many other writing systems the greek language holds an important place in the history of the western world and christianity  the canon of ancient greek literature includes seminal works in the western canon such as the epic poems iliad and odyssey  greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science  especially astronomy  mathematics and logic  and western philosophy  such as the platonic dialogues and the works of aristotle  are composed  the new testament of the christian bible was written in koiné greek  together with the latin texts and traditions of the roman world  the study of the greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of classics during antiquity  greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the mediterranean world and many places beyond  it would eventually become the official parlance of the byzantine empire and develop into medieval in its modern form  the greek language is the official language in two countries  greece and cyprus  a recognised minority language in seven other countries  and is one of the 24  official languages of the european union  the language is spoken by at least 13.2  million people today in greece  cyprus  italy  albania  turkey  and the greek diaspora greek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages  greek and latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary greek has been spoken in the balkan peninsula since around the 3rd  millennium or possibly the earliest written evidence is a linear b clay tablet found in messenia that dates to between 1450  and 1350  making greek the world s oldest recorded living language  among the indo-european  languages  its date of earliest written attestation is matched only by the now extinct anatolian languages the greek language is conventionally divided into the following periods in the modern era  the greek language entered a state of diglossia  the coexistence of vernacular and archaizing written forms of the language  what came to be known as the greek language question was a polarization between two competing varieties of modern greek  dimotiki  the vernacular form of modern greek proper  and katharevousa  meaning  purified   a compromise between dimotiki and ancient greek  which was developed in the early 19th  century and was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed greek state  in 1976,  dimotiki was declared the official language of greece  having incorporated features of katharevousa and giving birth to standard modern greek  which is used today for all official purposes and in historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the greek language is often emphasised  although greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages  never since classical antiquity has its cultural  literary  and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging  greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient greek as part of their own rather than a foreign it is also often stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages  according to one estimation   homeric greek is probably closer to demotic than 12-century  middle english is to modern spoken is spoken by about 13  million people  mainly in greece  albania and cyprus  but also worldwide by the large greek diaspora  there are traditional greek-speaking  settlements and regions in the neighbouring countries of albania  bulgaria  and turkey  as well as in several countries in the black sea area  such as ukraine  russia  romania  georgia  armenia  and azerbaijan  and around the mediterranean sea  southern italy  syria  israel  egypt  lebanon  libya and ancient coastal towns along the levant  the language is also spoken by greek emigrant communities in many countries in western europe  especially the united kingdom and germany  canada  the united states  australia  argentina  brazil  chile  south africa and others greek is the official language of greece  where it is spoken by almost the entire it is also the official language of cyprus  nominally alongside because of the membership of greece and cyprus in the european union  greek is one of the organization s 24  official furthermore  greek is officially recognised as a minority language in parts of italy and official in dropull and himara  albania  and as a minority language all over as well as in lebanon  syria  armenia  romania  and ukraine as a regional or minority language in the framework of the european charter for regional or minority greeks are also a recognised ethnic minority in hungary the phonology  morphology  syntax and vocabulary of the language show both conservative and innovative tendencies across the entire attestation of the language from the ancient to the modern period  the division into conventional periods is  as with all such periodisations  relatively arbitrary  especially because at all periods  ancient greek has enjoyed high prestige  and the literate borrowed heavily from it across its history  the syllabic structure of greek has varied little  greek shows a mixed syllable structure  permitting complex syllabic onsets but very restricted codas  it has only oral vowels and a fairly stable set of consonantal contrasts  the main phonological changes occurred during the hellenistic and roman period  see koine greek phonology for details  in all its stages  the morphology of greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes  a limited but productive system of and a rich inflectional system  although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time  morphological changes are present throughout  particularly in the nominal and verbal systems  the major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case  its functions being largely taken over by the genitive   the verbal system has lost the infinitive  the synthetically-formed  future and perfect tenses and the optative mood  many have been replaced by periphrastic  analytical  forms pronouns show distinctions in person (1st,  2nd,  and 3rd),  number  singular  dual  and plural in the ancient language  singular and plural alone in later stages   and gender  masculine  feminine  and neuter  and decline for case  from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern nouns  articles and adjectives show all the distinctions except for person  both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun the inflectional categories of the greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language s history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression  greek verbs have synthetic inflectional forms for many aspects of the syntax of greek have remained constant  verbs agree with their subject only  the use of the surviving cases is largely intact  nominative for subjects and predicates  accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions  genitive for possessors   articles precede nouns  adpositions are largely prepositional  relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial.  however  the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax  and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the modern form of the language  ancient greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive  and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely  instead having a raft of new periphrastic constructions  and uses participles more restrictively  the loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects  and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well   ancient greek tended to be verb-final,  but neutral word order in the modern language is vso or svo greek is a language distinguished by an extensive vocabulary  most of the vocabulary of ancient greek was inherited  but it includes a number of borrowings from the languages of the populations that inhabited greece before the arrival of words of non-indo-european  origin can be traced into greek from as early as mycenaean times  they include a large number of greek toponyms  the vast majority of modern greek vocabulary is directly inherited from ancient greek  but in some cases  words have changed meanings  loanwords  words of foreign origin  have entered the language mainly from latin  venetian and turkish  during the older periods of greek  loanwords into greek acquired greek inflections  thus leaving only a foreign root word  modern borrowings  from the 20th  century on   especially from french and english  are typically not inflected greek words have been widely borrowed into other languages  including english  mathematics  physics  astronomy  democracy  philosophy  athletics  theatre  rhetoric  baptism  evangelist  etc  moreover  greek words and word elements continue to be productive as a basis for coinages  anthropology  photography  telephony  isomer  biomechanics  cinematography  etc  and form  with latin words  the foundation of international scientific and technical vocabulary like all words ending with –logy   discourse    there are many english words of greek is an independent branch of the indo-european  language family  the ancient language most closely related to it may be ancient which many scholars suggest may have been a dialect of greek itself  but it is so poorly attested that it is difficult to conclude anything about independently of the macedonian question  some scholars have grouped greek into graeco-phrygian,  as greek and the extinct phrygian share features that are not found in other indo-european  among living languages  some indo-europeanists  suggest that greek may be most closely related to armenian  see graeco-armenian)  or the indo-iranian  languages  see graeco-aryan),  but little definitive evidence has been found for grouping the living branches of the in addition  albanian has also been considered somewhat related to greek and armenian by some linguists  if proven and recognised  the three languages would form a new balkan sub-branch  with other dead european b  attested as early as the late 15th  century bc  was the first script used to write it is basically a syllabary  which was finally deciphered by michael ventris and john chadwick in the 1950s   its precursor  linear a  has not been deciphered to this the language of the linear b texts  mycenaean greek  is the earliest known form of similar system used to write the greek language was the cypriot syllabary  also a descendant of linear a via the intermediate cypro-minoan  syllabary   which is closely related to linear b but uses somewhat different syllabic conventions to represent phoneme sequences  the cypriot syllabary is attested in cyprus from the 11th  century bc until its gradual abandonment in the late classical period  in favor of the standard greek has been written in the greek alphabet since approximately the 9th  century bc  it was created by modifying the phoenician alphabet  with the innovation of adopting certain letters to represent the vowels  the variant of the alphabet in use today is essentially the late ionic variant  introduced for writing classical attic in 403  bc  in classical greek  as in classical latin  only upper-case  letters existed  the lower-case  greek letters were developed much later by medieval scribes to permit a faster  more convenient cursive writing style with the use of ink and quill the greek alphabet consists of 24  letters  each with an uppercase  majuscule  and lowercase  minuscule  form  the letter sigma has an additional lowercase form  ς  used in the final position in addition to the letters  the greek alphabet features a number of diacritical signs  three different accent marks  acute  grave  and circumflex   originally denoting different shapes of pitch accent on the stressed vowel  the so-called  breathing marks  rough and smooth breathing   originally used to signal presence or absence of word-initial   h   and the diaeresis  used to mark full syllabic value of a vowel that would otherwise be read as part of a diphthong  these marks were introduced during the course of the hellenistic period  actual usage of the grave in handwriting saw a rapid decline in favor of uniform usage of the acute during the late 20th  century  and it has only been retained in typography after the writing reform of 1982,  most diacritics are no longer used  since then  greek has been written mostly in the simplified monotonic orthography  or monotonic system   which employs only the acute accent and the diaeresis  the traditional system  now called the polytonic orthography  or polytonic system   is still used internationally for the writing of ancient greek in greek  the question mark is written as the english semicolon  while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point  •   known as the ano teleia  άνω τελεία   in greek the comma also functions as a silent letter in a handful of greek words  principally distinguishing ό τι  ó ti   whatever   from ότι  óti  greek texts often used scriptio continua   continuous writing    which means that ancient authors and scribes would write word after word with no spaces or punctuation between words to differentiate or mark has occasionally been written in the latin script  especially in areas under venetian rule or by greek catholics  the term frankolevantinika   φραγκολεβαντίνικα applies when the latin script is used to write greek in the cultural ambit of catholicism  because frankos   φράγκος is an older greek term for roman catholic   frankochiotika   φραγκοχιώτικα  meaning  catholic chiot   alludes to the significant presence of catholic missionaries based on the island of chios  additionally the term greeklish is often used when the greek language is written in a latin script in online
