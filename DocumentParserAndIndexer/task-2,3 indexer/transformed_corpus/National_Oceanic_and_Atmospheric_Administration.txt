 379  noaa commissioned officer corpsthe national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa  pronounced  ˈnoʊ ə   like  noah   is an american scientific agency within the united states department of commerce that focuses on the conditions of the oceans and the atmosphere  noaa warns of dangerous weather  charts seas  guides the use and protection of ocean and coastal resources and conducts research to provide understanding and improve stewardship of the environment  in addition to its over 11,000  civilian noaa research and operations are supported by 321  uniformed service members who make up the noaa commissioned officer noaa traces its history back to the convergence of multiple agencies  the united states coastal and geodetic survey  founded in 1807),  the weather bureau (1870)  and the bureau of commercial fisheries (1871).  noaa was officially formed in the acting under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere at the department of commerce and the agency s interim administrator has been benjamin friedman since the end of the obama administration on january 20,  barry myers  ceo of accuweather is proposed to be the next plays several specific roles in society  the benefits of which extend beyond the u s  economy and into the larger global community the five  fundamental activities  are noaa was formed on october 3,  1970,  after u s  president richard nixon proposed creating a new agency to serve a national need for  better protection of life and property from natural hazards…for a better understanding of the total for exploration and development leading to the intelligent use of our marine resources   noaa formed a conglomeration of several existing scientific agencies that were among the oldest in the federal government  they were the united states coast and geodetic survey  formed in 1807;  the weather bureau  formed in 1870—geodetic  survey and weather service had been combined by a 1965  consolidation into the environmental science services administration  essa   including the uniformed commissioned corp  founded 1917);  and the bureau of commercial fisheries  formed in 1871.  noaa was established within the department of commerce via the reorganization plan no  4  of in 2007,  noaa celebrated 200  years of service with its ties to the united states coast and geodetic noaa commissioned officer corps is a uniformed service of men

noaa flag is a modification of the flag of one of its predecessor organizations  the united states coast and geodetic survey  the coast and geodetic survey s flag  authorized in 1899  and in use until 1970,  was blue  with a white circle centered in it and a red triangle centered within the circle  it symbolized the use of triangulation in surveying  and was flown by ships of the needed when noaa was established in 1970  and the coast and geodetic survey s assets became a part of noaa  noaa based its own flag on that of the coast and geodetic survey  the noaa flag is in essence the coast and geodetic survey flag  with the noaa logo—a circle divided by the silhouette of a seabird into an upper dark blue and a lower light blue section  but with the  noaa  legend omitted—centered within the red triangle  noaa ships in commission display the noaa flag  those with only one mast fly it immediately beneath the ship s commissioning pennant or the personal flag of a civilian official or flag officer if one is aboard the ship  while multimasted vessels fly it at the masthead of the forwardmost noaa ships fly the same ensign as united states navy ships but fly the noaa flag as a distinguishing mark to differentiate themselves from navy ships
