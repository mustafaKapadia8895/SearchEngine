 the great storm of 1987  was a violent extratropical cyclone that occurred on the night of 15–16  october  with hurricane-force  winds causing casualties in england  france and the channel islands as a severe depression in the bay of biscay moved northeast  among the most damaged areas were greater london  the east anglian coast  the home counties  the west of brittany and the cotentin peninsula of normandy which weathered gusts typically with a return period of 1  in 200  parks  roads and railways were strewn with fallen trees as well as schools being closed  the british national grid suffered heavy damage  leaving thousands without power  at least 22  people were killed in england and the highest measured gust of 117  kn (217  km h  135  mph  was recorded at pointe du roc  granville  france and the highest gust in the u k  of 100  kn (190  km h  120  mph  was recorded at day s weather reports had failed to indicate a storm of such severity  an earlier  correct forecast having been negated by later projections  the apparent suggestion by the bbc s michael fish of a false alarm is celebrated as a classic gaffe  though he claims he was the storm has been termed a weather bomb due to its rapid improvements were later implemented in atmospheric observation  relevant computer models  and the training of the sunday before the storm struck  the farmers  forecast had predicted bad weather on the following thursday or friday  15–16  by midweek  however  guidance from weather prediction models was somewhat equivocal  instead of stormy weather over a considerable part of the uk  the models suggested that severe weather would reach no farther north than the english channel and coastal parts of southern the afternoon of 15  october  winds were very light over most parts of the uk  the pressure gradient was slack  a depression was drifting slowly northwards over the north sea off eastern scotland  a trough lay over england  wales and ireland  over the bay of biscay  a depression was first gale warnings for sea areas in the english channel were issued at 0630  utc on 15  october and were followed  four hours later  by warnings of severe gales  at 1200  utc on 15  october  the depression which originated in the bay of biscay was centred near 46°  n  9°  w and its depth was 970  mb  by 1800  utc  it had moved north-east  to about 47°  n  6°  w  and deepened to 964  mb at 2235  utc  winds of force 10  were forecast  by midnight  the depression was over the western english channel  and its central pressure was 953  mb  at 0140  on 16  october  warnings of force 11  were issued  the depression now moved rapidly north-east,  filling a little as it did  reaching the humber estuary at about 0530  utc  by which time its central pressure was 959  mb  dramatic increases in temperature were associated with the passage of the storm s warm front in the sea areas  warnings of severe weather were both timely and adequate  although forecasts for land areas left much to be desired  during the evening of 15  october  radio and tv forecasts mentioned strong winds  but indicated that heavy rain would be the main feature  rather than wind  by the time most people went to bed  exceptionally strong winds had not been mentioned in national radio and tv weather broadcasts warnings of severe weather had been issued  however  to various agencies and emergency authorities  including the london fire brigade  perhaps the most important warning was issued by the met office to the ministry of defence  mod  at 0135  utc  16  october  it warned that the anticipated consequences of the storm were such that civil authorities might need to call on assistance from the military a highest gust of 119  kn (220  km h  137  mph  is estimated from satellite data at quimper  brittany  with the highest measured gust at 117  kn (217  km h  135  mph  at pointe du roc  granville south-east  england  where the greatest damage occurred  gusts of 70  knots (130  km h  81  mph  or more were recorded continually for three or four consecutive hours  during this time  the wind veered from southerly to south-westerly.  to the north-west  of this region  there were two maxima in gust speeds  separated by a period of lower wind speeds  during the first period  the wind direction was southerly  during the latter  it was south-westerly.  damage patterns in south-east  england suggested that tornadoes accompanied the storm in the uk  winds at shoreham-by-sea,  sussex reached 100  kn (190  km h  120  mph  before the anemometer many anemometers were reliant on mains power  and ceased recording as the south east of the united kingdom was blacked-out  by power cuts  thus losing much valuable winds with an estimated 200-year  return period hit the counties of kent  sussex  hampshire and along the coastal strip of essex  suffolk and south eastern north of a line from portland bill  dorset to cromer  norfolk the return period of the respective gusts were under 10  winds speeds greater than 75  mph were recorded for over an hour in southern according to the beaufort scale of wind intensities  this storm had winds of hurricane force 12  (73  mph or greater   as the term hurricane refers to tropical cyclones originating in the north atlantic or north pacific  the descriptor  great storm  has tended to be reserved for those storms in recent years reaching this velocity  hurricanes have a very different wind profile and distribution from storms  and significantly higher precipitation levels the storm made landfall in cornwall  and tracked north-east  towards devon and then over the midlands  going out to sea via the wash  the strongest gusts  of up to 100  knots (190  km h  120  mph   were recorded along the south-eastern  edge of the storm  hitting mainly hampshire  sussex  essex and kent  the royal sovereign lighthouse 6  miles (9.7  km  off eastbourne recorded wind speeds on its instruments at the highest velocity it could measure  110  mph (180  km h  the storm caused substantial damage over much of england  felling an estimated 15  million  including six of the seven eponymous oaks in historic specimens in kew gardens  wakehurst place  nymans garden  hyde park  london and scotney and most of the trees making up chanctonbury ring   at bedgebury national pinetum  kent almost a quarter of the trees were brought there have been many claims that the damage to forestry was made worse by broadleaf trees still being in leaf at the time of the storm  though this was not borne out by an analysis by the forestry trees blocked roads and railways and left widespread structural damage primarily to windows and roofs  several hundred thousand people were left without power  not fully restored until more than two weeks later  local electric utility officials later said they lost more wires in the storm than in the preceding decade  at sea  as well as many small boats being wrecked  a sealink cross-channel  ferry  the mv hengist  was driven ashore at folkestone and the bulk carrier mv sumnea capsized at dover  national grid sustained heavy damage during the event  as crashing cables short-circuited,  which in some cases overheated the main system  its headquarters faced the choice of keeping the grid online to help london as the storm approached but risk an incremental system breakdown  failure and burnout  or to shut down most of south east england including london and avert that risk  the headquarters made the decision  the first one like it since before world war ii  to shut down the south east power systems to maintain the network as soon as signs of overheating needed in london  many of the trees lining streets  particularly plane trees  were blown down overnight  blocking roads and crushing parked cars  building construction scaffolding and billboards collapsed in many places  and many buildings were damaged  the following morning  the bbc s largest broadcasting site  lime grove studios in white city  was unable to function due to a power failure — itv s tv-am  and bbc1's  breakfast time programmes were broadcast from different emergency facilities in emergency formats  tv-am  broadcast from thames television s euston road studios  while bbc newsreader nicholas witchell had to broadcast from the bbc1  continuity studio at bbc television centre  with the wall decorations used for children s bbc hastily taken down  much of the public transport in the capital was not functioning  and people were advised against trying to go to work  tv-am  host anne diamond did go back to the regular tv-am  studio with reporter kay burley  whilst richard keys remained in the thames television studio in case the power became even worse  and indeed  power did go back down at around 8:15am.the  départements of finistère  morbihan  côtes-d'armor  and ille-et-vilaine  in brittany  and the cotentin peninsula  manche and part of calvados  in normandy were the areas in france most affected by the storm  which followed a line from morbihan and rennes to 1.79  million homes were left without electricity supply and water  and a quarter of brittany s forest was destroyed  the total damage was estimated at ₣23  billion météo france announced  une petite tempête en provenance des açores   a little storm coming in from the azores   which reached brittany s coast at about 18:00,  later than expected  this depression caused little damage  with only 50  to 60  km h (31  to 37  mph  27  to 32  kn  winds  a much deeper depression hit ushant on the extreme western tip of brittany at midnight  it was measured at 948  hpa  or 948  mb  at the brest-guipavas  weather station  the lowest reading in its records dating back to stations on the coast at pointe du raz  pointe saint-mathieu  and penmarch gave no readings  as they were damaged by the high winds  the wind speed measured at brest was 148  km h (92  mph  80  kn   the centre of the storm crossed brittany from penmarch to saint-brieuc  at 110  km h (68  mph  59  kn   with gusts of wind up to 187  km h (116  mph  101  kn  at quimper  200  km h (120  mph  110  kn  at ouessant and 220  km h (140  mph  120  kn

day storm of peak wind velocities were in the early hours of the morning  which may have helped reduce the death toll  the storm hit the isle of wight at 02:00.  shanklin pier on the south-east  coast of the island was broken into three pieces as a result of mountainous waves  plans to rebuild the pier were soon abandoned  and the rest of the pier was demolished by contractors shortly afterwards  a monument now stands in front of what used to be the pier entrance a great deal of effort and money was put into the post-storm  clean-up  of forests and wooded areas  the writer oliver rackham and the charity common ground  were active in trying to prevent unnecessary destruction of trees which  although fallen  were still some landowners  such as the national trust  did not attempt complete clearing and replanting  realising that there was a unique opportunity to study the patterns of natural regeneration after such an number of wild boar may have escaped from captivity during the storm

heather angel wrote in the royal horticultural society s journal in some places this natural disaster has resulted in splendid vistas-  views long since forgotten by some and never before seen by a whole new generation  because of gaps left by fallen trees  visitors to arundel castle  the ancestral home of the dukes of norfolk  can now look out over the picturesque town    at the renowned woodland rhododendron garden at leonardslee  sussex  the gale    opened magnificent views by removing about a thousand trees which owner robin loder said he would never have had the courage to thin out the storm meteorologists at the university of reading led by professor keith browning developed the sting jet concept  during reanalysis of the storm they identified a mesoscale flow where the most damaging winds were shown to be emanating from the evaporating tip of the hooked cloud head on the southern flank of the cyclone  this cloud  hooked like a scorpion s tail  gives the wind region its name the  sting met office was severely criticised by most of the national press for failing to forecast the storm met office conducted an internal inquiry  scrutinised by two independent assessors  and a number of recommendations were made  chiefly  observational coverage of the atmosphere over the ocean to the south and west of the uk was improved by increasing the quality and quantity of observations from ships  aircraft  buoys and satellites  continued refinements were made to the computer models used in forecasting  and changes were made in the training of forecasters  in addition  reforms in the way the met office reports warnings of severe weather were implemented  leading to substantially more warnings being issued in the future  further deployment of improved tracking devices and improvements in the computer model simulations were supported by the purchase of an additional cray supercomputer  warnings for the burns  day storm just over two years later were accurate and on time  although the model forecast hinged on observations from two ships in the atlantic near the developing storm the day before it reached the meteorologist michael fish drew particular criticism for reporting several hours before the storm hit earlier on today  apparently  a woman rang the bbc and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way  well  if you re watching  don t worry  there isn t  but having said that  actually  the weather will become very windy  but most of the strong winds  incidentally  will be down over spain and across into has subsequently claimed that his comments about a hurricane had nothing to do with the uk  they referred to florida  usa  and were linked to a news story immediately preceding the weather bulletin  but had been so widely repeated out of context that the british public remains convinced that he was referring to the approaching storm  according to fish  the woman in question was actually a colleague s mother who was about to go on holiday in the caribbean  and had called regarding  the already long-dissipated)  hurricane floyd to see if it would be safe to fish has also claimed that  nobody phoned up  and that she was a "non-existing  woman   apparently contradicting the previous declaration  when interviewed about anita hart s claims of being the woman who made the went on to warn viewers that it would be  very windy  across the south of england  but predicted that the storm would move further south along the english channel and the british mainland would escape the worst effects  the remainder of his warning is frequently left out of re-runs,  which only adds to the public s misconception of that day s forecasting  his analysis has been defended by weather experts  in particular  the lack of a weather ship in the southwest approaches  due to met office meant the only manner of tracking the storm was by using satellite data  as automatic buoys had not been deployed at the time ironically  earlier forecasts as far back as the preceding weekend had correctly identified that gale-force  winds would affect southern england  however  later runs of the model had indicated a more southerly track for the low pressure system  incorrectly indicating that the strongest winds would be confined to northern and central france  the french meteorological office used a different computer weather model to the british  and the french model proved more accurate in predicting the severity of the storm in the channel in the wake of the storm the met office set up the national severe weather warning is claimed this storm was the worst since the great storm of which has been challenged as a storms of this strength regularly form over the north atlantic  where they typically track to the north of scotland  storms of such a strength have a return period of 30  to 40  the unusual aspect of the storm was that it struck the densely populated southeast of that winds in the south east had return periods of 1  in 200  years does not mean the winds of this strength occur once every 200  years  but that the winds have a 0.5%  probability of happening in a given 1]following  this storm 1.3  million incidents of damage were reported  which is only exceeded by the gale of january 1976  where destruction covered a wider area of the u k   with 1.5  million incidents of damage the burns  day storm hit the united kingdom in january 1990,  less than three years later and with comparable intensity following the storm few dealers made it to their desks and stock market trading
