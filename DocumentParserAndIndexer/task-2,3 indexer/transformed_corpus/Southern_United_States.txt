 the southern united states  also the american south  dixie  and the south   is a region of the united states of america  the south does not fully match the geographic south of the united states  but is commonly defined as including the states that fought for the confederate states of america in the american civil the deep south is fully located in the southeastern corner  arizona and new mexico  which are geographically in the southern part of the country  are rarely considered part  while west virginia  which separated from virginia in commonly some scholars have proposed definitions of the south that do not coincide neatly with state while the states of delaware and maryland  as well as the district of columbia permitted slavery prior to the start of the civil war  they remained with the union  since the civil rights movement of the 1960s,  they became more culturally  economically  and politically aligned with the industrial northern states  and are often identified as part of the mid-atlantic  or northeast by many residents  businesses  public institutions  and private however  the united states census bureau puts them in the south usually  the south is defined as including the southeastern and south-central  united states  the region is known for its culture and history  having developed its own customs  musical styles  and cuisines  which have distinguished it in some ways from the rest of the united states  the southern ethnic heritage is diverse and includes strong european  mostly english  scottish  scotch-irish,  irish  german  french  and spanish american   african  and some native american other aspects of the historical and cultural development of the south have been influenced by the institution of slave labor on plantations in the deep south to an extent seen nowhere else in the united states  the presence of a large proportion of african americans in the population  support for the doctrine of states  rights  and the legacy of racial tension magnified by the civil war and reconstruction era  as seen in thousands of lynchings  mostly from 1880  to 1930),  the segregated system of separate schools and public facilities known as  jim crow laws   that lasted until the 1960s,  and the widespread use of poll taxes and other methods to frequently deny black people of the right to vote or hold office until the 1960s.  since the late 1960s,  black people have held many offices in southern states  especially in the coastal states of virginia and south carolina  many black people have also been elected or appointed as mayors and police chiefs in the metropolises of memphis  houston  atlanta  and new orleans  and serve in both the u s  congress and state the south relied heavily on agriculture  and was highly rural until after 1945.  it has since become more industrialized and urban and has attracted national and international migrants  the american south is now among the fastest-growing  areas in the united states  houston is the largest city in the southern united sociological research indicates that southern collective identity stems from political  demographic  and cultural distinctiveness from the rest of the united states  the region contains almost all of the bible belt  an area of high protestant church attendance  especially evangelical churches such as the southern baptist convention  and predominantly conservative  religion-influenced  politics  indeed  studies have shown that southerners are more conservative than non-southerners  in several areas  including religion  morality  international relations and race this is evident in both the region s religious attendance figures and in the region s usually strong support for the republican party in political elections since the 1960s,  and especially since the from its climate  the living experience in the south increasingly resembles the rest of the nation  the arrival of millions of northerners  especially in major metropolitan areas and coastal and millions of has meant the introduction of cultural values and social norms not rooted in southern observers conclude that collective identity and southern distinctiveness are thus declining  particularly when defined against  an earlier south that was somehow more authentic  real  more unified and the process has worked both ways  however  with aspects of southern culture spreading throughout a greater portion of the rest of the united states in a process termed question of how to define the subregions in the south has been the focus of research for nearly a defined by the united states census the southern region of the united states includes sixteen states  as of 2010,  an estimated 114,555,744  people  or thirty-seven  percent of all u s  residents  lived in the south  the nation s most populous the census bureau defined three smaller divisions the council of state governments  an organization for communication and coordination between states  includes in its south regional office the states of alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  kentucky  louisiana  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  oklahoma  south carolina  tennessee  texas  virginia  and west terms related to the south include the popular definition of the  south  is more informal and generally associated with the 11  states that seceded before or during the civil war to form the confederate states of in order of their secession  these were  south carolina  mississippi  florida  alabama  georgia  louisiana  texas  virginia  arkansas  tennessee  and north carolina  these states share commonalities of history and culture that carry on to the present day  oklahoma was not a state during the civil war  but all its major native american tribes signed formal treaties of alliance with the needed the south is a diverse meteorological region with numerous climatic zones  including temperate  sub-tropical,  tropical  and arid—though the south generally has a reputation as hot and humid  with long summers and short  mild winters  most of the south—except for the higher elevations and areas near the western  southern and some northern fringes—fall in the humid subtropical climate zone  crops grow readily in the south  its climate consistently provides growing seasons of at least six months before the first frost  another common environment occurs in the bayous and swamplands of the gulf coast  especially in louisiana and in texas the first well-dated  evidence of human occupation in the south united states occurs around 9500  bc with the appearance of the earliest documented americans  who are now referred to as paleoindians were hunter-gathers  that roamed in bands and frequently hunted megafauna  several cultural stages  such as archaic  ca  8000–1000  bc  and the woodland  ca  1000  bc – ad 1000),  preceded what the europeans found at the end of the 15th  century—the mississippian mississippian culture was a complex  mound-building  native american culture that flourished in what is now the southeastern united states from approximately 800  ad to 1500  ad  natives had elaborate and lengthy trading routes connecting their main residential and ceremonial centers extending through the river valleys and from the east coast to the great some noted explorers who encountered and described the mississippian culture  by then in decline  included pánfilo de narváez (1528),  hernando de soto (1540),  and pierre le moyne d iberville (1699).native  american descendants of the mound-builders  include alabama  apalachee  caddo  cherokee  chickasaw  choctaw  creek  guale  hitchiti  houma  and seminole peoples  all of whom still reside in the south other peoples whose ancestral links to the mississippian culture are less clear but were clearly in the region before the european incursion include the catawba and the powhatan european immigration resulted in a corresponding die off of native americans who had not been exposed to various predominant culture of the south was rooted in the settlement of the region by british colonists  in the 17th  century  most voluntary immigrants were of english origins who settled chiefly along the coastal regions of the eastern seaboard but had pushed as far inland as the appalachian mountains by the 18th  century  the majority of early english settlers were indentured servants  who gained freedom after enough work to pay off their passage  the wealthier men who paid their way received land grants known as headrights  to encourage spanish and french established colonies in florida  texas and louisiana  the spanish colonized florida in the 16th  century  with their communities reaching a peak in the late 17th  century in the british colonies  immigration began in 1607  and continued until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775.  settlers cleared land  built houses and outbuildings  and on their own farms  the rich owned large plantations that dominated export agriculture and used slaves  many were involved in the labor-intensive  cultivation of tobacco  the first cash crop of virginia  tobacco exhausted the soil quickly  requiring that farmers regularly clear new fields  they used old fields as pasture  and for crops such as corn and wheat  or allowed them to grow into the mid-to-late-18th  century  large groups of ulster scots  later called the scotch-irish)  and people from the anglo-scottish  border region immigrated and settled in the back country of appalachia and the piedmont  they were the largest group of non-english  immigrants from the british isles before the american in the 1980  census  34%  of southerners reported that they were of english ancestry  english was the largest reported european ancestry in every southern state by a large early colonists engaged in warfare  trade  and cultural exchanges  those living in the backcountry were more likely to encounter creek indians  cherokee  and choctaws and other regional native groups the oldest university in the south  the college of william   mary  was founded in 1693  in virginia  it pioneered in the teaching of political economy and educated future u s  presidents jefferson  monroe and tyler  all from virginia  indeed  the entire region dominated politics in the first party system era  for example  four of the first five presidents—washington  jefferson  madison  and monroe—were from virginia  the two oldest public universities are also in the south  the university of north carolina (1789)  and the university of georgia (1785).with  virginia in the lead  the southern colonies embraced the american revolution  providing such leaders as commander in chief george washington  and the author of the declaration of independence  thomas jefferson in 1780–81,  the british largely halted reconquest of the northern states  and concentrated on the south  where they were told there was a large loyalist population ready to leap to arms once the royal forces arrived  the british took control of savannah and charleston  capturing a large american army in the process  and set up a network of bases inland  there were many more loyalists in the south than in the but they were concentrated in larger coastal cities and were not great enough in number to overcome the revolutionaries  large numbers of loyalists from south carolina fought for the british in the battle of camden  the british forces at the battle of monck s corner and the battle of lenud s ferry consisted entirely of loyalists with the exception of the commanding officer  banastre both white and black loyalists fought for the british at the battle of kemp s landing in led by nathanael greene and other generals  the americans engaged in fabian tactics designed to wear down the british invasion force  and to neutralize its strong points one by one  there were numerous battles large and small  with each side claiming some victories  by 1781,  however  british general cornwallis moved north to virginia  where an approaching army forced him to fortify and await rescue by the british navy  the british navy did arrive  but so did a stronger french fleet  and cornwallis was trapped  american and french armies  led by washington  forced cornwallis to surrender his entire army in yorktown  virginia in october 1781,  effectively winning the north american part of the revolution provided a shock to slavery in the south  thousands of slaves took advantage of wartime disruption to find their own freedom  catalyzed by the british governor dunmore of virginia s promise of freedom for service  many others were removed by loyalist owners and became slaves elsewhere in the empire  between 1770  and 1790,  there was a sharp decline in the percentage of blacks – from 61%  percent to 44%  in south carolina and from 45%  to 36%  in addition  some slaveholders were inspired to free their slaves after the revolution  they were moved by the principles of the revolution  and quaker and methodist preachers worked to encourage slaveholders to free their slaves  planters such as george washington often freed slaves by their wills  in the upper south  more than 10  percent of all blacks were free by 1810,  a significant expansion from pre-war  proportions of less than 1  percent became dominant in the lower south after 1800.  after the invention of the cotton gin  short staple cotton could be grown more widely  this led to an explosion of cotton cultivation  especially in the frontier uplands of georgia  alabama and other parts of the deep south  as well as riverfront areas of the mississippi delta  migrants poured into those areas in the early decades of the 19th  century  when county population figures rose and fell as swells of people kept moving west  the expansion of cotton cultivation required more slave labor  and the institution became even more deeply an integral part of the south s the opening up of frontier lands after the government forced most native americans to move west of the mississippi  there was a major migration of both whites and blacks to those territories  from the 1820s  through the 1850s,  more than one million enslaved africans were transported to the deep south in forced migration  two-thirds  of them by slave traders and the others by masters who moved there  planters in the upper south sold slaves excess to their needs as they shifted from tobacco to mixed agriculture  many enslaved families were broken up  as planters preferred mostly strong males for field major political issues that festered in the first half of the 19th  century caused political alignment along sectional lines  strengthened the identities of north and south as distinct regions with certain strongly opposed interests  and fed the arguments over states  rights that culminated in secession and the civil war  one of these issues concerned the protective tariffs enacted to assist the growth of the manufacturing sector  primarily in the north  in 1832,  in resistance to federal legislation increasing tariffs  south carolina passed an ordinance of nullification  a procedure in which a state would  in effect  repeal a federal law  soon a naval flotilla was sent to charleston harbor  and the threat of landing ground troops was used to compel the collection of tariffs  a compromise was reached by which the tariffs would be gradually reduced  but the underlying argument over states  rights continued to escalate in the following decades the second issue concerned slavery  primarily the question of whether slavery would be permitted in newly admitted states  the issue was initially finessed by political compromises designed to balance the number of  free  and  slave  states  the issue resurfaced in more virulent form  however  around the time of the mexican–american war  which raised the stakes by adding new territories primarily on the southern side of the imaginary geographic divide  congress opposed allowing slavery in these territories before the civil war  the number of immigrants arriving at southern ports began to increase  although the north continued to receive the most immigrants  hugenots were among the first settlers in charleston  along with the largest number of hasidic jews outside of new york needed  numerous irish immigrants settled in new orleans  establishing a distinct ethnic enclave now known as the irish channel  germans also went to new orleans and its environs  resulting in a large area north of the city  along the mississippi  becoming known as the german coast  however  still greater numbers immigrated to texas  especially after 1848),  where many bought land and were farmers  many more german immigrants arrived in texas after the civil war  where they created the brewing industry in houston and elsewhere  became grocers in numerous cities  and also established wide areas of farming by 1840,  new orleans was the wealthiest city in the country and the third largest in population  the success of the city was based on the growth of international trade associated with products being shipped to and from the interior of the country down the mississippi river  new orleans also had the largest slave market in the country  as traders brought slaves by ship and overland to sell to planters across the deep south  the city was a cosmopolitan port with a variety of jobs that attracted more immigrants than other areas of the because of lack of investment  however  construction of railroads to span the region lagged behind the north  people relied most heavily on river traffic for getting their crops to market and for transportation by 1856,  the south had lost control of congress  and was no longer able to silence calls for an end to slavery—which came mostly from the more populated  free states of the north  the republican party  founded in 1854,  pledged to stop the spread of slavery beyond those states where it already existed  after abraham lincoln was elected the first republican president in 1860,  seven cotton states declared their secession and formed the confederate states of america before lincoln was inaugurated  the united states government  both outgoing and incoming  refused to recognize the confederacy  and when the new confederate president jefferson davis ordered his troops to open fire on fort sumter in april 1861,  there was an overwhelming demand  north and south  for war  only the state of kentucky attempted to remain neutral  and it could only do so briefly  when lincoln called for troops to suppress what he referred to as  combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary  judicial or martial four more states decided to secede and join the confederacy  which then moved its capital to richmond  virginia   although the confederacy had large supplies of captured munitions and many volunteers  it was slower than the union in dealing with the border states  by march 1862,  the union largely controlled maryland  west virginia  kentucky and missouri  had shut down all commercial traffic from all confederate ports  had prevented european recognition of the confederate government  and was poised to seize new orleans in the four years of war 1861–65  the south was the primary battleground  with all but two of the major battles taking place on southern soil  union forces relentlessly squeezed the confederacy  controlling the border states in 1861,  the tennessee river  the cumberland river and new orleans in 1862,  and the mississippi river in 1863.  in the east  however  the confederate army under robert e  lee beat off attack after attack in its defense of their capital at richmond  but when lee tried to move north  he was repulsed  and nearly captured  at sharpsburg (1862)  and gettysburg (1863).the  confederacy had the resources for a short war  but was unable to finance or supply a longer war  it reversed the traditional low-tariff  policy of the south by imposing a new 15%  tax on all imports from the union  the union blockade stopped most commerce from entering the south  and smugglers avoided the tax  so the confederate tariff produced too little revenue to finance the war  inflated currency was the solution  but that created distrust of the richmond government  because of low investment in railroads  the southern transportation system depended primarily on river and coastal traffic by boat  both were shut down by the union navy  the small railroad system virtually collapsed  so that by 1864  internal travel was so difficult that the confederate economy was crippled the confederate cause was hopeless by the time atlanta fell and william t  sherman marched through georgia in late 1864,  but the rebels fought on  refusing to give up their independence until lee s army surrendered in april 1865.  all the confederate forces surrendered  and the region moved into the reconstruction era the south suffered much more than the north overall  as the union strategy of attrition warfare meant that lee could not replace his casualties  and the total war waged by sherman  sheridan and other union armies devastated the infrastructure and caused widespread poverty and distress  the confederacy suffered military losses of 95,000  men killed in action and 165,000  who died of disease  for a total of out of a total white southern population at the time of around 5.5  based on 1860  census figures  8%  of all white males aged 13  to 43  died in the war  including 6%  in the north and about 18%  in the northern military casualties exceeded southern casualties in absolute numbers  but were two-thirds  smaller in terms of proportion of the population affected after the civil war  the south was devastated in terms of population  infrastructure and economy  because of states  reluctance to grant voting rights to freedmen  congress instituted reconstruction governments  it established military districts and governors to rule over the south until new governments could be established  many white southerners who had actively supported the confederacy were temporarily disenfranchised  rebuilding was difficult as people grappled with the effects of a new labor economy of a free market in the midst of a widespread agricultural depression  in addition  what limited infrastructure the south had was mostly destroyed by the war  at the same time  the north was rapidly industrializing  to avoid the social effects of the war  most of the southern states initially passed black codes  eventually  these were mostly legally nullified by federal law and anti-confederate  legislatures  which existed for a short time during were thousands of people on the move  as african americans tried to reunite families separated by slaves sales  and sometimes migrated for better opportunities in towns or other states  other freed people moved from plantation areas to cities or towns for a chance to get different jobs  at the same time  whites returned from refuges to reclaim plantations or town dwellings  in some areas  many whites returned to the land to farm for a while  some freedpeople left the south altogether for states such as ohio and indiana  and later  kansas  thousands of others joined the migration to new opportunities in the mississippi and arkansas delta bottomlands and texas with passage of the 13th  amendment to the constitution of the united states  which outlawed slavery   the 14th  amendment  which granted full u s  citizenship to african americans  and the 15th  amendment  which extended the right to vote to african american males   african americans in the south were made free citizens and were given the right to vote  under federal protection  white and black republicans formed constitutional conventions and state governments  among their accomplishments were creating the first public education systems in southern states  and providing for welfare through orphanages  hospitals and similar institutions northerners came south to participate in politics and business  some were representatives of the freedmen s bureau and other agencies of reconstruction  some were humanitarians with the intent to help black people  some were adventurers who hoped to benefit themselves by questionable methods  they were all condemned with the pejorative term of carpetbagger  some southerners also took advantage of the disrupted environment and made money off various schemes  including bonds and financing for vigilante organizations such as the ku klux klan—an organization sworn to perpetuate white supremacy—had arisen quickly after the war s end and used lynching  physical attacks  house burnings and other forms of intimidation to keep african americans from exercising their political rights  although the first klan was disrupted by prosecution by the federal government in the early 1870s,  other groups persisted  by the mid-to-late-1870s,  elite southerners created increasing resistance to the altered social structure  paramilitary organizations such as the white league in louisiana (1874),  the red shirts in mississippi (1875)  and rifle clubs  all  white line  organizations  used organized violence against republicans  both black and white  to remove republicans from political office  repress and bar black voting  and restore the democratic party to in 1876  white democrats regained power in most of the state legislatures  they began to pass laws designed to strip african americans and poor whites from the voter registration rolls  the success of late-19th  century interracial coalitions in several states inspired a reaction among some white democrats  who worked harder to prevent both groups from discrimination  many blacks became property owners in areas that were still developing  for instance  90%  of the mississippi s bottomlands were still frontier and undeveloped after the war  by the end of the century  two-thirds  of the farmers in mississippi s delta bottomlands were black  they had cleared the land themselves and often made money in early years by selling off timber  tens of thousands of migrants went to the delta  both to work as laborers to clear timber for lumber companies  and many to develop their own by the end of the century  two-thirds  of farm owners in the delta bottomlands were needed  however  the long agricultural depression  along with disenfranchisement and lack of access to credit  led to many blacks in the delta losing their property by 1910  and becoming sharecroppers or landless workers over the following decade  more than two generations of free african americans lost their stake in all southerners  black and white  suffered as a result of the civil war  within a few years cotton production and harvest was back to pre-war  levels  but low prices through much of the 19th  century hampered recovery  they encouraged immigration by chinese and italian laborers into the mississippi delta  while the first chinese entered as indentured laborers from cuba  the majority came in the early 20th  century  neither group stayed long at rural farm the chinese became merchants and established stores in small towns throughout the delta  establishing a place between white and continued in the late 19th  and early 20th  centuries among both blacks and whites  in the last two decades of the 19th  century about 141,000  blacks left the south  and more after 1900,  totaling a loss of 537,000.  after that the movement increased in what became known as the great migration from 1910  to 1940,  and the second great migration through 1970.  even more whites left the south  some going to california for opportunities and others heading to northern industrial cities after 1900.  between 1880  and 1910,  the loss of whites totaled five million more left between 1940  and 1970.from  1890  to 1908,  ten of the eleven former confederate states  along with oklahoma upon statehood  passed disfranchising constitutions or amendments that introduced voter registration barriers—such as poll taxes  residency requirements and literacy tests—that were hard for many poor to meet  most african americans  most mexican americans  and tens of thousands of poor whites were disfranchised  losing the vote for decades  in some states  grandfather clauses temporarily exempted white illiterates from literacy tests  the numbers of voters dropped drastically throughout the former confederacy as a result  this can be seen via the feature  turnout in presidential and midterm elections  at the university of texas’ politics  barriers to voting  alabama  which had established universal white suffrage in 1819  when it became a state  also substantially reduced voting by poor controlled legislatures passed jim crow laws to segregate public facilities and services  including transportation while african americans  poor whites and civil rights groups started litigation against such provisions in the early 20th  century  for decades supreme court decisions overturning such provisions were rapidly followed by new state laws with new devices to restrict voting  most blacks in the former confederacy and oklahoma could not vote until 1965,  after passage of the voting rights act and federal enforcement to ensure people could register  despite increases in the eligible voting population with the inclusion of women  blacks  and those eighteen and over throughout this period  turnout in ex-confederate  states remained below the national average throughout the 20th  not until the late 1960s  did all american citizens regain protected civil rights by passage of legislation following the leadership of the american civil rights movement at the end of the 19th  century  white democrats in the south had created state constitutions that were hostile to industry and business development  with anti-industrial  laws extensive from the time new constitutions were adopted in the banking was as was access to credit  states persisted in agricultural needed  especially in alabama and florida  rural minorities held control in many state legislatures long after population had shifted to industrializing cities  and legislators resisted business and modernising interests  alabama refused to redistrict between 1901  and 1972,  long after major population and economic shifts to cities  for decades birmingham generated the majority of revenue for the state  for instance  but received little back in services or the late 19th  century  texas rapidly expanded its railroad network  creating a network of cities connected on a radial plan and linked to the port of galveston  it was the first needed in which urban and economic development proceeded independently of rivers  the primary transportation network of the past  a reflection of increasing industry were strikes and labor unrest   in 1885  texas ranked ninth among forty states in number of workers involved in strikes (4,000);  for the six-year  period it ranked fifteenth  seventy-five  of the one hundred strikes  chiefly interstate strikes of telegraphers and railway workers  occurred in the year 1890  dallas became the largest city in texas  and by 1900  it had a population of more than 42,000,  which more than doubled to over 92,000  a decade later  dallas was the harnessmaking capital of the world and a center of other manufacturing  as an example of its ambitions  in 1907  dallas built the praetorian building  fifteen storeys tall and the first skyscraper west of the mississippi  soon to be followed by other texas was transformed by a railroad network linking five important cities  among them houston with its nearby port at galveston  dallas  fort worth  san antonio  and el paso  each exceeded fifty thousand in population by 1920,  with the major cities having three times that interests were ignored by the southern democrat ruling class  nonetheless  major new industries started developing in cities such as atlanta  ga  birmingham  al  and dallas  fort worth and houston  texas  growth began occurring at a geometric rate  birmingham became a major steel producer and mining town  with major population growth in the early decades of the 20th  century the first major oil well in the south was drilled at spindletop near beaumont  texas  on the morning of january 10,  1901.  other oil fields were later discovered nearby in arkansas  oklahoma  and under the gulf of mexico  the resulting  oil boom  permanently transformed the economy of the west south central states and produced the most significant economic expansion after the civil war in the early 20th  century  invasion of the boll weevil devastated cotton crops in the south  producing an additional catalyst to african americans  decisions to leave the south  from 1910  to 1940,  and then from the 1940s  to 1970,  more than 6.5  million african americans left the south in the great migration to northern and midwestern cities  defecting from persistent lynching  violence  segregation  poor education  and inability to vote  black migration transformed many northern cities  creating new cultures and music  many african americans  like other groups  became industrial workers  others started their own businesses within the communities  southern whites also migrated to industrial cities  especially chicago and detroit  where they took jobs in the booming new auto industry later  the southern economy was dealt additional blows by the great depression and the dust bowl  after the wall street crash of 1929,  the economy suffered significant reversals and millions were left unemployed  beginning in 1934  and lasting until 1939,  an ecological disaster of severe wind and drought caused an exodus from texas and arkansas  the oklahoma panhandle region  and the surrounding plains  in which over 500,000  americans were homeless  hungry and thousands left the region forever to seek economic opportunities along the west coast president franklin d  roosevelt noted the south as the  number one priority  in terms of need of assistance during the great depression  his administration created programs such as the tennessee valley authority in 1933  to provide rural electrification and stimulate development  locked into low-productivity  agriculture  the region s growth was slowed by limited industrial development  low levels of entrepreneurship  and the lack of capital investment world war ii marked a time of change in the south as new industries and military bases were developed by the federal government  providing badly needed capital and infrastructure in many regions  people from all parts of the us came to the south for military training and work in the region s many bases and new industries  farming shifted from cotton and tobacco to include soybeans  corn  and other foods industrial growth increased in the 1960s  and greatly accelerated into the 1980s  and 1990s.  several large urban areas in texas  georgia  and florida grew to over four million people  rapid expansion in industries such as autos  telecommunications  textiles  technology  banking  and aviation gave some states in the south an industrial strength to rival large states elsewhere in the country  by the 2000  census  the south  along with the west  was leading the nation in population growth  however  with this growth has come long commute times and air pollution problems in cities such as dallas  houston  atlanta  austin  charlotte  and others that rely on sprawling development and highway networks in the late 20th  century  the south changed dramatically  it saw a boom in its service economy  manufacturing base  high technology industries  and the financial sector  texas in particular witnessed dramatic growth and population change with the dominance of the energy industry and tourism such as the alamo mission in san antonio  tourism in florida and along the gulf coast also grew steadily throughout the last decades of the 20th  century numerous new automobile production plants have opened in the region  or are soon to open  such as mercedes-benz  in tuscaloosa  alabama  hyundai in montgomery  alabama  the bmw production plant in spartanburg  south carolina  toyota plants in georgetown  kentucky  blue springs  mississippi and san antonio  the gm manufacturing plant in spring hill  tennessee  a honda factory in lincoln  alabama  the nissan north american headquarters in franklin  tennessee and factories in smyrna  tennessee and canton  mississippi  a kia factory in west point  georgia  and the volkswagen chattanooga assembly plant in tennessee the two largest research parks in the country are located in the south  research triangle park in north carolina  the world s largest  and the cummings research park in huntsville  alabama  the world s fourth largest  in medicine  the texas medical center in houston has achieved international recognition in education  research  and patient care  especially in the fields of heart disease  cancer  and rehabilitation  in 1994  the texas medical center was the largest medical center in the world including fourteen hospitals  two medical schools  four colleges of nursing  and six university the university of texas m d  anderson cancer center is consistently ranked the #1  cancer research and treatment center in the united major banking corporations have headquarters in the region  bank of america is in charlotte  north carolina  wachovia was headquartered there before

maryland  virginia  north carolina  south carolina  and georgia  were british colonies that sent delegates to sign the declaration of independence and then fought against the government along with the northern colonies during the revolutionary war  the basis for much southern culture derives from the pride in these states being among the 13  original colonies  and from the fact that much of the population of the south has strong ancestral links to colonists who emigrated west  southern manners and customs reflect the relationship with england and africa that was held by the early population  with some influences being provided by the native american populations of the the south has had lower percentages of high school graduates  lower housing values  lower household incomes  and lower cost of living than the rest of the united these factors  combined with the fact that southerners have continued to maintain strong loyalty to family ties  has led some sociologists to label white southerners an ethnic or quasi-ethnic  though this interpretation has been subject to criticism on the grounds that proponents of the view do not satisfactorily indicate how southerners meet the criteria of predominant culture of the south has its origins with the settlement of the region by large groups of northern english  scots lowlanders and ulster-scots   later called the scotch-irish)  who settled in appalachia and the piedmont in the 18th  century  and from parts of southern england such as east anglia  kent and the west country in the 17th  and the many african slaves who were part of the southern economy  african-american  descendants of the slaves brought into the south compose the united states  second-largest  racial minority  accounting for 12.1  percent of the total population according to the 2000  census  despite jim crow era outflow to the north  the majority of the black population remains concentrated in the southern states  and has heavily contributed to the cultural blend  christianity  foods  art  music  see spiritual  blues  jazz and rock and roll   that characterize southern culture today in previous censuses  the largest ancestry group identified by southerners was english or mostly with 19,618,370  self-reporting   english  as an ancestry on the 1980  census  followed by 12,709,872  listing  irish  and 11,054,127  almost a third of all americans who claim english ancestry can be found in the american south  and over a quarter of all southerners claim english descent as the south also continues to have the highest percentage of african americans in the country  due to the history of slavery the south has been a stronghold of evangelical although the upper class in virginia and south carolina was anglican  the first great awakening and the second great awakening from about 1742  about 1850  generated large numbers of methodists and by 1900,  the southern baptist convention had become numerically largest group  especially in rural areas and remain followed by methodists  with other denominations found throughout the region  roman catholics historically were concentrated in maryland  louisiana  and hispanic areas such as south texas and south florida and along the gulf coast  the great majority of black southerners are baptist or statistics show that southern states have the highest religious attendance figures of any region in the united has been strong across the south since the late 19th  football  especially at the college and high school level  is by far the most popular team sport in most areas of the southern united states the region is home to numerous decorated and historic college football programs  particularly in the southeastern conference  known as the  sec    atlantic coast conference  known as the  acc    and the big 12  conference  the sec  consisting entirely of teams based in southern states  is widely considered to be the strongest league in contemporary college football and includes the alabama crimson tide  the program with the most national championships in the sport s history  the sport is also highly competitive and has a spectator following at the high school level  particularly in rural areas where high school football games often serve as prominent community gatherings though not as popular on a wider basis as the collegiate game  professional football also has a growing tradition in the southern united states  before league expansion began in the 1960s,  the only established professional team based in the south was the washington redskins  who still retain a large following in many pockets of the region  later on  the merger-era  national football league began to expand into the football-crazed  deep south in the 1960s  with franchises like the atlanta falcons  new orleans saints  houston oilers  miami dolphins  and most prominently the dallas cowboys  who overtook washington as the region s most popular team and eventually became widely considered the most popular team in the united states  in later decades  nfl expansion into southern states continued  with the tampa bay buccaneers  jacksonville jaguars  and carolina panthers added to the league  while the houston oilers were replaced by the houston texans after the oilers relocated to nashville to become the tennessee titans baseball has been played in the southern united states since at least the years leading up to the american civil war  it was traditionally more popular than american football until the 1980s,  and still accounts for the largest annual attendance amongst sports played in the south  the first mention of a baseball team in houston was on april 11,  19th  century and early 20th  century games were common  especially once the professional leagues such as the texas league  the dixie league  and the southern league were organized the short-lived  louisville colonels were a part of the early national league and american association  but ceased to exist in 1899.  the first southern major league baseball team after the colonels appeared in 1962  when the houston colt .45s   known today as the houston astros  were enfranchised  later  the atlanta braves came in 1966,  followed by the texas rangers in 1972,  and finally the miami marlins and tampa bay rays in the 1990s.college  baseball appears to be more well attended in the southern u s  than elsewhere  as teams like arkansas  lsu  virginia  mississippi state  ole miss  south carolina  and texas are commonly at the top of the ncaa s the south generally produces very successful collegiate baseball teams as well  with virginia  vanderbilt  lsu  and south carolina winning recent college world series titles the following is a list of best-attended  baseball teams in the southern u s  the southern states are commonly associated with stock car racing and its most prominent competition nascar  which is based in charlotte  north carolina  the sport was developed in the deep south in the early 20th  century  with stock car racing s historic mecca being daytona beach  florida  where cars initially raced on the wide  flat beachfront before the construction of daytona international speedway  though the sport has attained a following throughout the united states  a majority of nascar races continue to take place at southern tracks basketball is very popular throughout the southern united states as both a recreational and spectator sport  particularly in the states of north carolina and kentucky which are home to several historically prominent college basketball programs  prominent nba teams based in the south include the houston rockets  san antonio spurs  oklahoma city thunder  dallas mavericks  washington wizards  charlotte hornets  atlanta hawks  orlando

augusta  georgia  which has become one of the professional game s most important tournaments in recent decades association football  known in the south as in the rest of the united states as  soccer   has become a popular sport at youth and collegiate levels throughout the region  the game has been historically widespread at the college level in the atlantic coast states of maryland  virginia  and the carolinas  which contain many of the nation s most successful college soccer programs the establishment of major league soccer has led to professional soccer clubs in the southern cities including fc dallas  houston dynamo  orlando city  and atlanta united  the current united states third division soccer league  the united soccer league  was initially geographically based in the coastal southeast around clubs in charleston  richmond  charlotte  wilmington  raleigh  virginia beach  and atlanta nine southern states have obesity rates exceeding thirty percent of the population  the highest in the country  mississippi  louisiana  west virginia  alabama  oklahoma  arkansas  south carolina  kentucky  and rates for hypertension and diabetes for these states are also the highest in the a study reported that six southern states have the worst incidence of sleep disturbances in the nation  attributing the disturbances to high rates of obesity and the south has a higher percentage of obese and it has the largest number of people dying from and the highest rates of cognitive life expectancy is lower and death rates are higher in the south than in other regions of the united states for all racial this disparity reflects substantial divergence between the south and other regions since the middle of the 20th  east south central census division of the united states  made up of kentucky  tennessee  mississippi  and alabama  had the highest rate of inpatient hospital stays in 2012.  the other divisions  west south central  texas  oklahoma  arkansas  and louisiana  and south atlantic  west virginia  delaware  maryland  virginia  north carolina  south carolina  georgia  and florida  ranked seventh and fifth  the south had a significantly higher rate of hospital discharges in 2005  than other regions of the united states  but the rate had declined to be closer to the overall national rate by cancer in a region  the south  particularly an axis from west

in  all cancers combined  death rates by state  2011"  from the centers for disease control and the first decades after reconstruction  when white democrats regained power in the state legislatures  they began to make voter registration more complicated  to reduce black needed  with a combination of intimidation  fraud and violence by paramilitary groups  they suppressed black voting and turned republicans out of office  from 1890  to 1908,  ten of eleven states ratified new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised most black voters and many poor white voters  this disfranchisement persisted for six decades into the 20th  century  depriving blacks and poor whites of all political representation  because they could not vote  they could not sit on juries  they had no one to represent their interests  resulting in state legislatures consistently underfunding programs and services  such as schools  for blacks and poor the collapse of the republican party in nearly all parts of the south  the region became known as the “solid south”  and the democratic party after 1900  moved to a system of primaries to select their candidates  victory in a primary was tantamount to election  from the late 1870s  to the 1960s,  only rarely was a state or national southern politician a republican  apart from a few appalachian mountain republicans  however  continued to control parts of the appalachian mountains and compete for power in the border states  apart from a few states  such as the byrd machine in virginia  the crump machine in memphis   and a few other local organizations  the democratic party itself was very lightly organized  it managed primaries but party officials had little other role  to be successful a politician built his own network of friends  neighbors and allies  reelection was the norm  and the result from 1910  to the late 20th  century was that southern democrats in congress had accumulated seniority  and automatically took the chairmanships of all by the 1940s  the supreme court began to find disfranchisement measures like the “grandfather clause” and the white primary unconstitutional  southern legislatures quickly passed other measures to keep blacks disfranchised  even after suffrage was extended more widely to poor whites  because white democrats controlled all the southern seats in congress they had outsize power in congress and could sidetrack or filibuster efforts by northerners to pass legislation against lynching  for example increasing support for civil rights legislation by the national democratic party beginning in 1948  caused segregationist southern democrats to nominate strom thurmond on a third-party  “dixiecrat” ticket in 1948.  these dixiecrats returned to the party by 1950,  but southern democrats held off republican inroads in the suburbs by arguing that only they could defend the region from the onslaught of northern liberals and the civil rights movement  in response to the brown v  board of education ruling of 1954,  101  southern congressmen (19  senators  82  house members of which 99  were southern democrats and 2  were republicans  in 1956  denounced the brown decisions as a  clear abuse of judicial power climaxes a trend in the federal judiciary undertaking to legislate in derogation of the authority of congress and to encroach upon the reserved rights of the states and the people   the manifesto lauded  “   those states which have declared the intention to resist enforced integration by any lawful means”  it was signed by all southern senators except majority leader lyndon b  johnson  and tennessee senators albert gore  sr  and estes kefauver  virginia closed schools in warren county  prince edward county  charlottesville  and norfolk rather than integrate  but no other state followed suit  democratic governors orval faubus of arkansas  ross barnett of mississippi  john connally of texas  lester maddox of georgia  and  especially  george wallace of alabama resisted integration and appealed to a rural and blue-collar  northern democrats’ support of civil rights issues culminated when democratic president lyndon b  johnson signed into law the civil rights act of 1964  and the voting rights act of 1965,  which ended legal segregation and provided federal enforcement of voting rights for blacks  in the presidential election of 1964,  barry goldwater’s only electoral victories outside his home state of arizona were in the states of the deep south where few blacks could vote before the 1965  voting rights of resistance to integration in public places broke out in violence during the 1960s  by the shadowy ku klux klan  which caused a backlash among major resistance to school busing extending into the republicans such as richard nixon began to develop their southern strategy to attract conservative white southerners  especially the middle class and suburban voters  in addition to migrants from the north and traditional gop pockets in appalachia  the transition to a republican stronghold in the south took decades  first  the states started voting republican in presidential elections  except for native sons jimmy carter in 1976  and bill clinton in 1992  and 1996.  then the states began electing republican senators and finally governors  georgia was the last state to do so  with sonny perdue taking the governorship in in addition to its middle class and business base  republicans cultivated the religious right and attracted strong majorities from the evangelical or fundamentalist vote  mostly southern baptists  which had not been a distinct political force prior to the 2012  elections  the eleven states of the former confederacy were represented by 98  republicans  40  south produced nine of the first twelve presidents prior to the civil war  for more than a century after the civil war  no politician from an antebellum slave state became president unless he either moved north  like woodrow wilson  or was vice president when the president died in office  like andrew johnson  harry truman and lyndon b  johnson   in 1976,  jimmy carter defied this trend and became the first southerner to break the pattern since zachary taylor in 1848.  the south has produced five of the last nine american presidents  lyndon b  johnson (1963–69),  jimmy carter (1977–81),  george h  w  bush (1989–93),  bill clinton (1993–2001)  and george w  bush (2001–2009).  johnson was a native of texas  while carter is from georgia  and clinton from arkansas  while george h w  and george w  bush began their political careers in texas  they were both born in new england and have their ancestral roots in the region the south has produced various nationally known politicians and political movements  in 1948,  a group of democratic congressmen  led by governor strom thurmond of south carolina  split from the democrats in reaction to an anti-segregation  speech given by minneapolis mayor and future senator hubert humphrey of minnesota  they founded the states rights democratic or dixiecrat party  during that year’s presidential election  the party ran thurmond as its candidate and he carried four deep south states in the 1968  presidential election  alabama governor george c  wallace ran for president on the american independent party ticket  wallace ran a “law and order” campaign similar to that of republican candidate  richard nixon  nixon’s southern strategy of gaining electoral votes downplayed race issues and focused on culturally conservative values  such as family issues  patriotism  and cultural issues that appealed to southern baptists in the 1994  mid-term  elections  another southern politician  newt gingrich  led the republican revolution  ushering in twelve years of gop control of the house  gingrich became speaker of the united states house of representatives in 1995  and served until his resignation in 1999.  tom delay was the most powerful republican leader in needed  until he was indicted under criminal charges in 2005  and was forced to step aside by republican needed  apart from bob dole of kansas (1985–96),  the recent republican senate leaders have been southerners  howard baker (1981–85)  of tennessee  trent lott (1996–2003)  of mississippi  bill frist (2003–2006)  of tennessee  and mitch mcconnell (2007–present)  of kentucky the republicans candidates for president have won the south in elections since 1972,  except for 1976.  however  the region is not entirely monolithic  and every successful democratic candidate since 1976  has claimed at least three southern states  barack obama won florida  maryland  delaware  north carolina  and virginia in 2008  but did not repeat his victory in north carolina during his 2012  reelection americans had lived in the south for nearly 12,000  years  they were defeated by settlers in a series of wars ending in the war of 1812  and the seminole wars  and most were removed west to indian territory  now oklahoma and kansas   however large numbers of native americans managed to stay behind by blending into the surrounding society  this was especially true of the wives of euro-american  merchants and miners the south witnessed two major events in the lives of 20th  century african americans  the great migration and the american civil rights movement the great migration began during world war i  hitting its high point during world war ii  during this migration  blacks left the south to find work in northern factories and other sectors of the migration also empowered the growing civil rights movement  while the movement existed in all parts of the united states  its focus was against disfranchisement and the jim crow laws in the south  most of the major events in the movement occurred in the south  including the montgomery bus boycott  the mississippi freedom summer  the march on selma  alabama  and the assassination of martin luther king  jr   in addition  some of the most important writings to come out of the movement were written in the south  such as king s  letter from birmingham jail   most of the civil rights landmarks can be found around the south  the martin luther king  jr   national historic site in atlanta includes a museum that chronicles the american civil rights movement as well as martin luther king  jr  s boyhood home on auburn avenue  additionally  ebenezer baptist church is located in the sweet auburn district as is the king center  location of martin luther and coretta scott king s gravesites the civil rights movement ended jim crow laws across the south  a second migration appears to be underway  with african americans from the north moving to the south in record while race relations are still a contentious issue in the south  the region surpasses the rest of the country in many areas of integration and racial equality  according to 2003  report by researchers at the university of wisconsin–milwaukee  virginia beach  charlotte  nashville-davidson,  and jacksonville were the four most integrated of the nation s fifty largest cities  with memphis at number southern states tend to have a low disparity in incarceration rates between blacks and whites relative to the rest of the southerners use the confederate flag to identify themselves with the south  states  rights and southern tradition  groups  such as the league of the south  have a high regard for the secession movement of 1860,  citing a desire to protect and defend southern numerous political battles have erupted over flying the confederate flag over state capitols  and the naming of public buildings or highways after confederate leaders  the prominence of certain statues  and the everyday display of confederate symbols of the south include the bonnie blue flag  magnolia trees  and the song south was heavily rural as late as the 1940s,  but now the population is increasingly concentrated in metropolitan areas  the
