 rossby waves  also known as planetary waves  are a natural phenomenon in the atmosphere and oceans of planets that largely owe their properties to rotation of the planet  rossby waves are a subset of inertial waves atmospheric rossby waves on earth are giant meanders in high-altitude  winds that have a major influence on weather  these waves are associated with pressure systems and the jet oceanic rossby waves move along the thermocline  the boundary between the warm upper layer and the cold deeper part of the ocean atmospheric rossby waves result from the conservation of potential vorticity and are influenced by the coriolis force and pressure gradient  a fluid  on the earth  that moves toward the pole will deviate toward the east  a fluid moving toward the equator will deviate toward the west  true in either hemisphere   the deviations are caused by the coriolis force and conservation of potential vorticity which leads to changes of relative vorticity  this is analogous to conservation of angular momentum in mechanics  in planetary atmospheres  including earth  rossby waves are due to the variation in the coriolis effect with latitude  carl-gustaf  arvid rossby first identified such waves in the earth s atmosphere in 1939  and went on to explain their motion one can identify a terrestrial rossby wave as its phase velocity  marked by its wave crest  always has a westward component  however  the collected set of rossby waves may appear to move in either direction with what is known as its group velocity  in general  shorter waves have an eastward group velocity and long waves a westward group velocity the terms  barotropic  and  baroclinic  are used to distinguish the vertical structure of rossby waves  barotropic rossby waves do not vary in the vertical  and have the fastest propagation speeds  the baroclinic wave modes  on the other hand  do vary in the vertical  they are also slower  with speeds of only a few centimeters per second or investigations of rossby waves has been done on those in earth s atmosphere  rossby waves in the earth s atmosphere are easy to observe as  usually 4-6)  large-scale  meanders of the jet stream  when these deviations become very pronounced  masses of cold or warm air detach  and become low-strength  anticyclones and cyclones  respectively  and are responsible for day-to-day  weather patterns at mid-latitudes.  the action of rossby waves partially explains why eastern continental edges  such as the northeast united states and eastern canada  are colder than western europe at the same convection  heat transfer  to the troposphere is enhanced over very warm sea surfaces in the tropics  such as during el niño events  this tropical forcing generates atmospheric rossby waves that have a poleward and eastward migration.poleward-propagating  rossby waves explain many of the observed statistical connections between low-  and high-latitude  one such phenomenon is sudden stratospheric warming  poleward-propagating  rossby waves are an important and unambiguous part of the variability in the northern hemisphere  as expressed in the pacific north america pattern  similar mechanisms apply in the southern hemisphere and partly explain the strong variability in the amundsen sea region of in 2011,  a nature geoscience study using general circulation models linked pacific rossby waves generated by increasing central tropical pacific temperatures to warming of the amundsen sea region  leading to winter and spring continental warming of ellsworth land and marie byrd land in west antarctica via an increase in rossby waves  like kelvin waves  can occur on any rotating planet with an atmosphere  the y-shaped  cloud feature on venus is attributed to kelvin and rossby rossby waves are large-scale  waves within an ocean basin  they have a low amplitude  on the order of centimetres  at the surface  to metres  at the thermocline   compared to a very long wavelength  on the order of hundreds of kilometres of atmospheric rossby waves  they may take months to cross an ocean basin  they gain momentum from wind stress at the ocean surface layer and are thought to communicate climatic changes due to variability in forcing  due to both the wind and buoyancy  both barotropic and baroclinic waves cause variations of the sea surface height  although the length of the waves made them difficult to detect until the advent of satellite altimetry  satellite observations have confirmed the existence of oceanic rossby waves also generate significant displacements of the oceanic thermocline  often of tens of meters  satellite observations have revealed the stately progression of rossby waves across all the ocean basins  particularly at low-  and mid-latitudes.  these waves can take months or even years to cross a basin like the pacific rossby waves have been suggested as an important mechanism to account for the heating of the ocean on europa  a moon of wave instabilities are also thought to be found in astrophysical discs  for example  around newly forming stars  start with  a zonal mean flow  u  can be considered to be perturbed where u is constant in time and space  let u →   ⟨ u   v ⟩   displaystyle   vec  u    langle u v rangle   be the total horizontal wind field  where u and v are the components of the wind in the x-  and y-  directions  respectively  the total wind field can be written as a mean flow  u  with a small superimposed perturbation  u′ and v′ the perturbation is assumed to be much smaller than the mean zonal flow relative vorticity η  u and v can be written in terms of the stream function ψ   displaystyle  psi    assuming non-divergent  flow  for which the stream function completely describes the flow  considering a parcel of air that has no relative vorticity before perturbation  uniform u has no vorticity  but with planetary vorticity f as a function of the latitude  perturbation will lead to a slight change of latitude  so the perturbed relative vorticity must change in order to conserve potential vorticity  also the above approximation u    u  ensures that the perturbation flow does not advect relative vorticity with β   ∂ f ∂ y   displaystyle  beta    frac   partial f   partial y      plug in the definition of stream function to obtain using the method of undetermined coefficients one can consider a traveling wave solution with zonal and meridional wavenumbers k and ℓ  respectively  and frequency ω   displaystyle  omega    this yields the dispersion relation the zonal (x-direction)  phase speed and group velocity of the rossby wave are then given bywhere c is the phase speed  cg is the group speed  u is the mean westerly flow  β   displaystyle  beta   is the rossby parameter  k is the zonal wavenumber  and ℓ is the meridional wavenumber  it is noted that the zonal phase speed of rossby waves is always westward  traveling east to west  relative to mean flow u  but the zonal group speed of rossby waves can be eastward or westward depending on wavenumber the rossby parameter is defined  φ   displaystyle  varphi   is the latitude  ω is the angular speed of the earth s rotation  and a is the mean radius of the earth if β   0    displaystyle  beta =0}    there will be no rossby waves  rossby waves owe their origin to the gradient of the tangential speed of the planetary rotation  planetary vorticity   a  cylinder  planet has no rossby waves  it also means that at the equator of any rotating  sphere-like  planet  including earth  one will still have rossby waves  despite the fact that f   0    displaystyle f=0}    because β   0    displaystyle  beta >0}     equatorial rossby wave  it has been proposed that a number of regional weather extremes in the northern hemisphere associated with blocked atmospheric circulation patterns may have been caused by quasiresonant amplification of rossby examples include the 2013  european floods  the 2012  china floods  the 2010  russian heat wave  the 2010  pakistan floods and the 2003  european heat wave  even taking global warming into account  the 2003  heat wave would have been highly unlikely without such a mechanism normally freely travelling synoptic-scale  rossby waves and quasistationary planetary-scale  rossby waves exist in the mid-latitudes  with only weak interactions  the hypothesis  proposed by vladimir petoukhov  stefan rahmstorf  stefan petri  and hans joachim schellnhuber  is that under some circumstances these waves interact to produce the static pattern  for this to happen  they suggest  the zonal (east-west)  wave number of both types of wave should be in the range 6–8,  the synoptic waves should be arrested within the troposphere  so that energy does not escape to the stratosphere  and mid-latitude  waveguides should trap the quasistationary components of the synoptic waves  in this case the planetary-scale  waves may respond unusually strongly to orography and thermal sources and sinks because of  quasiresonance  it is also suggested that the phenomenon is made more likely by anthropogenic global warming  but the european environment agency has cautioned that more data would be needed to confirm that specific events such as flooding were caused by global research was furthered in 2017  by michael e  mann  stefan rahmstorf  et al  study in scientific connectivity pattern

yields a clear association with the pattern of the atmospheric rossby it is found that alternating densities of negative and positive links are arranged in half rossby wave distances around 3500,
