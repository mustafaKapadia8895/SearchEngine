became a state a century after the signing of the united states declaration of independence colorado is bordered by wyoming to the north  nebraska to the northeast  kansas to the east  oklahoma to the southeast  new mexico to the south  utah to the west  and arizona to the southwest at the four corners  colorado is noted for its vivid landscape of mountains  forests  high plains  mesas  canyons  plateaus  rivers  and desert lands denver is the capital and the most populous city of colorado  residents of the state are properly known as coloradans  although the term  coloradoan  has been used archaically and lives on in the title of fort collins  newspaper  the is notable for its diverse geography  ranging from alpine mountains  arid plains and deserts with huge sand dunes  deep canyons  sandstone and granite rock formations  rivers  lakes  and lush forests  the borders of colorado were originally defined to be lines of latitude and longitude  making its shape a latitude-longitude  quadrangle which stretches from 37°n  to 41°n  latitude and from 102°03'w  to 109°03'w  longitude (25°w  to 32°w  from the washington colorado  wyoming and utah are the only states which have boundaries defined solely by lines of latitude and longitude the summit of mount elbert at 14,440  feet (4,401.2  m  elevation in lake county is the highest point in colorado and the rocky mountains of north colorado is the only u s  state that lies entirely above 1,000  meters  elevation  the point where the arikaree river flows out of yuma county  colorado  and into cheyenne county  kansas  is the lowest point in colorado at 3,317  feet (1,011  m  elevation  this point  which holds the distinction of being the highest low elevation point of any is higher than the high elevation points of 18  states and the district of columbia a little less than one half of the area of colorado is flat and rolling land  east of the rocky mountains are the colorado eastern plains of the high plains  the section of the great plains within nebraska at elevations ranging from roughly 3,350  to 7,500  feet (1,020  to 2,290  the colorado plains were mostly prairies  but they have many patches of deciduous forests  buttes  and canyons  eastern colorado is presently mainly covered in farmland and rangeland  along with small farming villages and towns  precipitation is fair  averaging from 15  to 25  inches (380  to 640  mm  corn  wheat  hay  soybeans  and oats are all typical crops  and most of the villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a grain elevator  irrigation water is available from the south platte  the arkansas river  and a few other streams  and also from subterranean sources  including artesian wells  however  heavy use of ground water from wells for irrigation has caused underground water reserves to decline  as well as crop agriculture  eastern colorado hosts considerable livestock  such as cattle ranches and hog farms roughly 70%  of colorado s population resides along the eastern edge of the rocky mountains in the front range urban corridor between cheyenne  wyoming  and pueblo  colorado  this region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the pacific ocean region by the high rockies in the middle of colorado  the  front range  includes denver  boulder  fort collins  loveland  colorado springs  pueblo  greeley and other townships and municipalities in between  on the other side of the rockies  the significant population centers in western colorado  which is not considered the  front range   are the cities of grand junction  durango  and montrose the continental divide of the americas extends along the crest of the rocky mountains  the area of colorado to the west of the continental divide is called the western slope of colorado  drainage water west of the continental divide flows to the southwest via the colorado river and the green river into the gulf of california within the interior of the rocky mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins  in the north  on the east side of the continental divide is the north park of colorado  the north park is drained by the north platte river  which flows north into wyoming and nebraska  just to the south of north park  but on the western side of the continental divide  is the middle park of colorado  which is drained by the colorado river  the south park of colorado is the region of the headwaters of the south platte river in southmost colorado is the large san luis valley  where the headwaters of the rio grande are located  the valley sits between the sangre de cristo mountains and san juan mountains  and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains  the rio grande drains due south into new mexico  mexico  and texas  across the sangre de cristo range to the east of the san luis valley lies the wet mountain valley  these basins  particularly the san luis valley  lie along the rio grande rift  a major geological formation of the rocky mountains  and its branches to the west of the great plains of colorado rises the eastern slope of the rocky mountains  notable peaks of the rocky mountains include longs peak  mount evans  pikes peak  and the spanish peaks near walsenburg  in southern colorado  this area drains to the east and the southeast  ultimately either via the mississippi river or the rio grande into the gulf of mexico the rocky mountains within colorado contain about 53  peaks that are 14,000  feet (4,267  m  or higher in elevation above sea level  known as these mountains are largely covered with trees such as conifers and aspens up to the tree line  at an elevation of about 12,000  feet (3,700  m  in southern colorado to about 10,500  feet (3,200  m  in northern colorado  above this only alpine vegetation grows  only small parts of the colorado rockies are snow-covered  year round much of the alpine snow melts by mid-august  with the exception of a few snowcapped peaks and a few small glaciers  the colorado mineral belt  stretching from the san juan mountains in the southwest to boulder and central city on the front range  contains most of the historic gold-  and silver-mining  districts of colorado  mount elbert is the highest summit of the rocky mountains  the 30  highest major summits of the rocky mountains of north america all lie within the state the western slope of colorado is drained by the colorado river and its tributaries  primarily the gunnison river  green river and the san juan river  or by evaporation in its arid areas  the colorado river flows through glenwood canyon and then through an arid valley made up of desert from rifle to parachute  through the desert canyon of de beque canyon  and into the arid desert of grand valley  where the city of grand junction is located  also prominent in or near the southern portion of the western slope are the grand mesa  which lies to the southeast of grand junction  the high san juan mountains  a rugged mountain range  and to the west of the san juan mountains  the colorado plateau  a high arid region that borders southern utah the city of grand junction  colorado is the largest city on the western slope  grand junction and durango are the only major centers of television broadcasting west of the continental divide in colorado  though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers  higher education in and near the western slope can be found at colorado mesa university in grand junction  western state college of colorado in gunnison  fort lewis college in durango  and colorado mountain college in glenwood springs and steamboat springs grand junction is located along interstate 70,  the only major highway in western colorado  grand junction is also along the major railroad of the western slope  the union pacific  this railroad also provides the tracks for amtrak s california zephyr passenger train  which crosses the rocky mountains between denver and grand junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways the western slope lies in close proximity to multiple notable destinations in the colorado rocky mountains  including glenwood springs  with its resort hot springs  and the ski resorts of aspen  breckenridge  vail  crested butte  steamboat springs  and telluride the northwestern corner of colorado is a sparsely populated region  and it contains part of the noted dinosaur national monument  which is not only a paleontological area  but is also a scenic area of rocky hills  canyons  arid desert  and streambeds  here  the green river briefly crosses over into colorado from west to east  the land of colorado consists of desert lands  desert plateaus  alpine mountains  national forests  relatively flat grasslands  scattered forests  buttes  and canyons in the western edge of the great plains  the famous pikes peak is located just west of colorado springs  its isolated peak is visible from nearly the kansas border on clear days  and also far to the north and the lands in colorado are located in and around areas such as the pueblo  canon city  florence  great sand dunes national park and preserve  san luis valley  cortez  canyon of the ancients national monument  hovenweep national monument  ute mountain  delta  grand junction  colorado national monument  and other areas surrounding the uncompahgre plateau and uncompahgre national forest colorado is one of four states in the united states that share a common geographic point – the four corners together with arizona  new mexico  and utah  at this intersection  it is possible to stand in four states at once the climate of colorado is more complex than states outside of the mountain states region  unlike most other states  southern colorado is not always warmer than northern colorado  most of colorado is made up of mountains  foothills  high plains  and desert lands  mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate as a general rule  with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation  northeast  east  and southeast colorado are mostly the high plains  while northern colorado is a mix of high plains  foothills  and mountains  northwest and west colorado are predominantly mountainous  with some desert lands mixed in  southwest and southern colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas the climate of the eastern plains is semiarid  köppen climate classification  bsk  with low humidity and moderate precipitation  usually from 15  to 25  inches (380  to 640  millimetres  annually  the area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool  clear nights  which give this area a great average diurnal temperature range  the difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to space during clear nights  the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds the front range urban corridor  where most of the population of colorado resides  lies in a pronounced precipitation shadow as a result of being on the lee side of the rocky summer  this area can have many days above 95  °f (35  °c  and often 100  °f (38  on the plains  the winter lows usually range from 25  to −10  °f (−4  to −23  °c   about 75%  of the precipitation falls within the growing season  from april to september  but this area is very prone to droughts  most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms  which can be severe  and from major snowstorms that occur in the winter and early spring  otherwise  winters tend to be mostly dry and much of the region  march is the snowiest month  april and may are normally the rainiest months  while april is the wettest month overall  the front range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to chinook winds which warm the area  sometimes bringing temperatures of 70  °f (21  °c  or higher in the the average july temperature is 55  °f (13  °c  in the morning and 90  °f (32  °c  in the afternoon  the average january temperature is 18  °f (−8  °c  in the morning and 48  °f (9  °c  in the afternoon  although variation between consecutive days can be 40  °f (20  °c  just west of the plains and into the foothills  there are a wide variety of climate types  locations merely a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography  most valleys have a semi-arid  climate not unlike the eastern plains  which transitions to an alpine climate at the highest elevations  microclimates also exist in local areas that run nearly the entire spectrum of climates  including subtropical highland  cfb cwb   humid subtropical  cfa   humid continental  dfa dfb   mediterranean  csa csb  and subarctic weather changes are common in colorado  although the majority of extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state  thunderstorms are common east of the continental divide in the spring and summer  yet are usually brief  hail is a common sight in the mountains east of the divide and in the northwest part of the state  the eastern plains have had some of the biggest hail storms in north eastern plains are part of the extreme western portion of tornado alley  some damaging tornadoes in the eastern plains include the 1990  limon f3  tornado and the 2008  windsor ef3  tornado  which devastated the small the plains are also susceptible to occasional floods  which are caused both by thunderstorms and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather  notable examples include the big thompson river flooding of 1976  and the 2013  colorado floods  denver s record in 1901  for the number of consecutive days above 90  °f (32  °c  was broken during the summer of 2008.  the new record of 24  consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a of colorado is a very dry state averaging only 17  inches (430  millimetres  of precipitation per year statewide and rarely experiences a time when some portion of the state is not in some degree of the lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of wildfires in the state  such as the hayman fire  one of the largest wildfires in american history  and the fourmile canyon fire of 2010,  which until the waldo canyon fire and high park fire of june 2012,  and the black forest fire of june 2013,  was the most destructive wildfire in colorado s recorded history however  some of the mountainous regions of colorado receive a huge amount of moisture from winter snowfalls  the spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in the yampa river  the colorado river  the rio grande  the arkansas river  the north platte river  and the south platte river water flowing out of the colorado rocky mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms  towns  and cities of the southwest states of new mexico  arizona  utah  and nevada  as well as the midwest  such as nebraska and kansas  and the southern states of oklahoma and texas  a significant amount of water is also diverted for use in california  occasionally  formerly naturally and consistently   the flow of water reaches northern mexico the highest ambient air temperature ever recorded in colorado was 118  °f (48  °c  on july 11,  1888,  at bennett  the lowest air temperature was −61  °f (−52  °c  on february 1,  1985,  at its mountainous terrain  colorado is relatively quiet seismically  the u s  national earthquake information center is located in golden on august 22,  2011,  a 5.3  magnitude earthquake occurred 9  miles (14  km  west-southwest  of the city of there were no casualties and only a small amount of damage was reported  it was the second largest earthquake in colorado  a magnitude 5.7  earthquake was recorded in region that is today the state of colorado has been inhabited by native americans for more than 13,000  years  the lindenmeier site in larimer county contains artifacts dating from approximately 11200  bc to 3000  bc  the eastern edge of the rocky mountains was a major migration route that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the americas  the ancient pueblo peoples lived in the valleys and mesas of the colorado the ute nation inhabited the mountain valleys of the southern rocky mountains and the western rocky mountains  even as far east as the front range of present day  the apache and the comanche also inhabited eastern and southeastern parts of the state  at times  the arapaho nation and the cheyenne nation moved west to hunt across the high plains the u s  acquired a territorial claim to the eastern rocky mountains with the louisiana purchase from france in 1803.  this u s  claim conflicted with the claim by spain to the upper arkansas river basin as the exclusive trading zone of its colony of santa fé de nuevo méxico  in 1806,  zebulon pike led a u s  army reconnaissance expedition into the disputed region  colonel pike and his men were arrested by spanish cavalrymen in the san luis valley the following february  taken to chihuahua  and expelled from mexico the following july the u s  relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the arkansas river and south of 42nd  parallel north and west of the 100th  meridian west as part of its purchase of florida from spain with the adams-onís  treaty of 1819.  the treaty took effect february 22,  1821.  having settled its border with spain  the u s  admitted the southeastern portion of the territory of missouri to the union as the state of missouri on august 10,  1821.  the remainder of missouri territory  including what would become northeastern colorado  became unorganized territory  and remained so for 33  years over the question of slavery  after 11  years of war  spain finally recognized the independence of mexico with the treaty of córdoba signed on august 24,  1821.  mexico eventually ratified the adams-onís  treaty in 1831.  the texian revolt of 1835–36  fomented a dispute between the u s  and mexico which eventually erupted into the mexican–american war in 1846.  mexico surrendered its northern territory to the u s  with the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo at the conclusion of the war in 1848.most  american settlers traveling overland west to the oregon country  namely the new goldfields of california  or the new mormon settlements of the state of deseret in the salt lake valley  avoided the rugged southern rocky mountains  and instead followed the north platte river and sweetwater river to south pass  wyoming   the lowest crossing of the continental divide between the southern rocky mountains and the central rocky mountains  in 1849,  the mormons of the salt lake valley organized the extralegal state of deseret  claiming the entire great basin and all lands drained by the rivers green  grand  and colorado  the federal government of the u s  flatly refused to recognize the new mormon government  because it was theocratic and sanctioned plural marriage  instead  the compromise of 1850  divided the mexican cession and the northwestern claims of texas into a new state and two new territories  the state of california  the territory of new mexico  and the territory of utah  on april 9,  1851,  mexican american settlers from the area of taos settled the village of san luis  then in the new mexico territory  later to become colorado s first permanent euro-american  settlement in 1854,  senator stephen a  douglas persuaded the u s  congress to divide the unorganized territory east of the continental divide into two new organized territories  the territory of kansas and the territory of nebraska  and an unorganized southern region known as the indian territory  each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries  but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between free soil and pro-slavery  factions the gold seekers organized the provisional government of the territory of jefferson on august 24,  1859,  but this new territory failed to secure approval from the congress of the united states embroiled in the debate over slavery  the election of abraham lincoln for the president of the united states on november 6,  1860,  led to the secession of nine southern slave states and the threat of civil war among the states  seeking to augment the political power of the union states  the republican party-dominated  congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the territory of kansas into the union as the free state of kansas on january 29,  1861,  leaving the western portion of the kansas territory  and its gold-mining  areas  as unorganized territory thirty days later on february 28,  1861,  outgoing u s  president james buchanan signed an act of congress

the confederacy  the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the union cause in 1862,  a force of texas cavalry invaded the territory of new mexico and captured santa fe on march 10.  the object of this western campaign was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of colorado and california and to seize ports on the pacific ocean for the confederacy  a hastily organized force of colorado volunteers force-marched  from denver city  colorado territory  to glorieta pass  new mexico territory  in an attempt to block the texans  on march 28,  the coloradans and local new mexico volunteers stopped the texans at the battle of glorieta pass  destroyed their cannon and supply wagons  and dispersed 500  of their horses and mules  the texans were forced to retreat to santa fe  having lost the supplies
