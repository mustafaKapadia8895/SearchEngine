 a bow echo is the characteristic radar return from a mesoscale convective system that is shaped like an archerâ€™s bow  these systems can produce severe straight-line  winds and occasionally tornadoes  causing major damage  they can also become derechos the term  bow echo  was first used by dr  theodore fujita in his may 1978  paper  manual of downburst identification for project in 2004,  research was done to better anticipate the formation of bow echoes  specifically the formation of bow echoes from weakly organized squall lines and supercells  researchers determined that bow echoes were most likely to occur in weakly organized a midwest bow echo workshop was held in 2007,  at which meteorologists gathered to share their research to better understand bow bow echo is associated with squall lines or lines of convective thunderstorms  these echoes can range in size from 20  to 200  km  and have a life span of 3  to 6  hours  bow echoes tend to develop when moderate to strong wind shear exists in the lower 2  to 3  km of the atmosphere  while similar to squall lines  bow echoes are smaller in scale and are moved by the wind inside them  they tend to push outward and after time die out  a bow echo also lowers the chance of a tornado being formed in the storm itself  the  bow shaped  echo is a result of focusing of the strong flow at the rear of the especially strong bow echoes that cause devastating damage all along the width of the storm are often called derechos the formation of a bow echo requires a strong elevated rear inflow jet at mid-levels.  the strength of the cold pool and mesohigh at the surface as well as warmer temperatures aloft due to convection works to create a mesolow at mid-levels  which strengthens the jet  upon reaching the edge of the convection the jet descends and spreads along the surface  generating straight-line  the rear inflow jet has bowed the storm system  book end or line end vortices develop on either side of the jet  these vortices are similar in due to the small size of the bow echo  the vortices help enhance the mid-level  flow between them  this strengthens the rear inflow jet  the surface winds increase from the descending as the life of the storm increases  the coriolis force acts to intensify the cyclonic vortex and weaken the anticyclonic vortex  the system then develops an asymmetric comma-shaped  some embedded tornadoes or gustnadoes develop within these vortices damaging straight-line  winds often occur near the center of a bow echo  damage from all severe thunderstorm winds account for half of all severe reports in the lower 48  states of the us and is more common than damage from tornadoes  in a type of long-lived  and powerful bow echo known as a derecho  wind speeds can reach up to or exceeding 100  mph (160  km h  and can produce a damage path extending for hundreds of bow echoes are capable of producing straight-line  winds that are just as strong as many tornadoes  a strong bow echo will produce more widespread and intense damage than the majority of tornadoes  also  bow echoes in the form of a line echo wave pattern create a favorable environment for tornadoes to form the semiarid climate and rugged terrain in the interior west of the united states do not favour the development of bow echoes  however  on 21  april 2011,  a bow echo associated with a fast-moving  mid-tropospheric  perturbation formed across the great salt lake  gsl  in utah  producing damaging winds along its 1674,  the city of utrecht in the netherlands was devastated by a storm now thought to have been a bow echo storm  some of the damage to the city is still visible  and severe storm activity was recorded across other areas of
