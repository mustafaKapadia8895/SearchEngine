 the 1957  atlantic hurricane season was a generally inactive year for tropical cyclogenesis in the north atlantic basin  there were eight tropical storms – two of which went unnamed – and three hurricanes  two of which intensified further to attain major hurricane 1]  the season officially began on june 15  and ended on november 15,  though the year s first tropical cyclone developed prior to the start of the season on june 8.  the final storm dissipated on october 27,  well before the official end of the season  the strongest hurricane of the year was carrie  which reached the equivalent of a category 4  hurricane on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale on two separate occasions in the open atlantic  carrie later caused the sinking of the german ship pamir southwest of the azores  resulting in 80  deaths in total  the season resulted in at least 513  fatalities and $152.5  million in 2]  hurricane audrey was the season s most destructive and deadly storm  causing 416  deaths and about $150  million in damages  audrey made landfall just east of sabine pass  texas  in the u s  state of louisiana as a strong category 3  hurricane in late june  three other tropical storms in the year made landfalls along the gulf coast of the united states  bringing heavy rains that resulted in widespread flooding across much of the southeastern united states  the highest rainfall total measured associated with a tropical cyclone was 18.39  in (467  mm  in quarantine  louisiana  during tropical storm esther  however  an unofficial reading of 19  in (480  mm  was measured in an unknown location in the florida panhandle during tropical storm the year s other tropical systems curved out to sea without causing much impact  after the season  the name audrey was retired the atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 15,  it was a below-average  season in which eight tropical cyclones formed  of which three became of these hurricanes  two became major in an average season  ten tropical cyclones form  of which five become five of the season s eight tropical cyclones developed in the gulf of mexico  the most since the 1936  season  in which six formed in the the first tropical storm of the season formed on june 8,  a week before the official start of the hurricane season  however  the first named storm  audrey  formed afterwards  on june 25;  these two storms were the only to form in june during the season  july featured no atlantic tropical cyclones  tropical storm bertha was the only system to form during august  developing in the gulf of despite warm sea surface temperatures  ssts  in the tropical atlantic  no storms formed during the month  below the climatological average of the low monthly activity was in part due to an unfavorable wind pattern which prevailed across the atlantic for much of the month  in september  however  conditions for tropical cyclogenesis were more favorable  with concomitant cyclonic activity  four storms formed  of which two attained hurricane strength  higher than the mean activity of the last 70  by contrast  only one tropical storm formed in october  below the average of two in the this tropical storm dissipated on october 27,  16  days before the official end of the hurricane tropical cyclones made landfall during the hurricane season  including one hurricane  all of these storms made landfall on the gulf coast of the united states  property damage that resulted from cyclone-related  impacts totaled to $152  million in the united states  with most caused by hurricane audrey  which made landfall near the border between texas and 513  deaths were also caused by tropical storms during the with 416  deaths attributable to hurricane season s activity was reflective with an accumulated cyclone energy  ace  rating of 84,  which is categorized as being  near however  this was under the 1950–2000  average of ace is  broadly speaking  a measure of the power of hurricanes multiplied by the length of time it existed  so storms that last a long time  as well as particularly strong hurricanes  have high aces  it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical cyclones with winds exceeding 39  mph (63  km h   which is tropical storm area of disturbed weather accompanied by low barometric pressure was first identified near the yucatán peninsula on june 7.  reports from the following day in the region reported pressures that were indicative of a developing tropical and at 06:00  utc  the disturbance attained tropical depression strength  the first of the season  the depression quickly developed into a tropical storm later that though hurricane reconnaissance flights could not locate a well-defined  center  ship observations showed that the tropical storm was moving quickly to the due to its fast forward motion  the storm gained little in organization and made landfall near port leon  florida  on june 9  with winds of 50  mph (85  however  the system gradually strengthened as it crossed the florida peninsula  reentering the north atlantic later that on june 10,  the storm reached peak winds of 65  mph (100  km h  prior to becoming an extratropical storm  the post-tropical  cyclone then strengthened and moved erratically in open seas before entirely dissipating on june the tropical storm s fast passage over land  heavy rainfall was officially peaking at 14.95  in (380  mm  in live oak  florida  however  unofficial reports of at least 19  in (480  mm  of rain were in perry  florida  100–200  families were evacuated due to the floodwater  field crops  including tobacco and watermelon  were damaged  with flood damage estimated at $30,000.  the storm also spawned ten tornadoes  with nine in northeastern florida and one on georgia s jekyll island  all of these tornadoes were relatively weak and caused minor damage  totaling to $12,000.  at the coast  the tropical storm s strong winds generated waves 2–3  ft (0.61–0.91  m  high  which caused moderate though located south of where the storm made landfall  buildings and roads along the tampa bay area waterfront were flooded by the thee cabin cruiser kinnebar capsized in the gulf of mexico due to the and five of the seven crew on board drowned  these were the only deaths associated with the system  coastal damages due to storm surge amounted to $10,000,  and overall the storm caused $52,000  in damages across the southeastern united ill-defined  tropical wave was first identified in the caribbean sea on june 20,  and moved westward into the bay of campeche  the disturbance slowly strengthened as it developed a low pressure a nearby trough aided the intensification of the and it developed into a tropical depression on june 25,  while remaining generally stationary in the bay of campeche  situated in an area of favorable upper-air  divergence and warm ssts  the storm quickly organized and strengthened  reaching hurricane strength later that day  audrey began to accelerate northward due to troughing in the upper-levels  in the during this time  the hurricane rapidly intensified  attaining category 3  hurricane on june 27,  audrey reached peak intensity with winds of 145  mph (235  km h   and made landfall at this intensity near the mouth of the sabine river later that the hurricane quickly weakened as it moved inland  becoming an extratropical cyclone by june the extratropical remnants of audrey moved northeastward across the united states  before completely dissipating on june 29  over southern audrey caused widespread impacts across a wide swath of the united states and the storm s worst effects were felt in louisiana  where the storm caused $120  million in damages  the highest storm surge measured with the hurricane was 12.4  ft (3.8  m   reported west of cameron  louisiana  the strong surge inundated much of the coast  killing much of the local wildlife and causing widespread property heavy rainfall also caused flooding  peaking at 10.63  in (270  mm  west of basile  louisiana  rainfall was concentrated particularly in the atchafalaya in texas  effects of the storm were much less severe  but the storm still caused $8  million in damages  primarily as a result of strong further inland  the weakening hurricane spawned tornadoes and caused additional flooding in conjunction with a frontal the effects of audrey were felt as far north as canada  where 15  people died due to the strong winds and heavy in total  the storm caused $152  million in damages and at least 416  weak extratropical low entered the gulf of mexico on august 6  and drifted slowly westward  the system slowly organized  developing into a tropical storm on august 8  about 100  mi (160  km  south of the mississippi river moving generally northward  bertha quickly the system attained its peak intensity with 65  mph (105  km h  and an estimated minimum pressure of 998  mbar  hpa  29.47  inhg  on august that same day  bertha came ashore near cameron  louisiana at the same after landfall  the storm moved northward due to a strong high-pressure  system and weakened over before degenerating into a remnant low at 1800  utc on august 11  over the storm s remnants later moved across the u s  interior highlands before the gulf of mexico  1,350  workers on offshore oil drilling platforms were evacuated in preparation for the the oil drilling tender murmanill no  1  sunk due to the strong though the two people on board at the time were evacuated by helicopter  at the coast  the maximum storm surge height measured was 4.7  ft (1.4  m  at the schooner bayou control bertha dropped heavy rainfall primarily as a remnant low across much of the ozarks  rainfall peaked at 13.77  in (350  mm  near damascus  arkansas  which set a 24-hour  rainfall record for the city and made august 1957  the wettest month on across arkansas  the heavy rains triggered flash floods after numerous rivers exceeded flood stage  the flash floods caused property damage in cities adjacent to rivers  though damage estimates were difficult to accurately obtain  four arkansas counties reported combined losses of and two deaths were carrie formed from an easterly tropical wave off the western coast of africa on september moving to the west  the storm gradually intensified  reaching hurricane strength on september 5.  carrie intensified further  before reaching peak intensity on september 8  as a category 4  hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140  mph (225  km h  in the open atlantic ocean  the hurricane curved northward and fluctuated in intensity before recurving to the west and restrengthening  attaining category 4  intensity for a second time as it neared bermuda on september however  carrie passed well north of the island and turned to the northeast towards europe  weakening as it reached higher latitudes  the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september 23,  prior to affecting areas of the british to its distance away from any major land masses  carrie caused relatively minor damage along its path  on september 16,  the hurricane passed well north of bermuda  causing minimal damage despite its intensity at the though hurricane reconnaissance flights in the area were postponed due to damage sustained by one of the as it was transitioning to an extratropical cyclone southwest of the azores  the german ship pamir encountered the storm and capsized on september 21,  resulting in the deaths of 80  crew members on as an extratropical storm  carrie brought strong storm surge and heavy rain to the british isles  which claimed three the hurricane s long duration and path in open water also helped it attain a number of atlantic hurricane september 5,  a weak easterly wave moved into the gulf of mexico from the caribbean sea due to the influence of an upper-level  the wave organized and spawned a weak area of circulation which developed into a tropical storm by 0600  utc on september moving steadily towards the northeast at roughly 15  mph (25  km h   debbie only marginally strengthened due to the presence of cooler air entrainment  early on september 8,  debbie made landfall near fort walton beach  florida as a minimal tropical storm with winds of 40  mph (65  a minimum barometric pressure of 1005  mbar  hpa  29.68  inhg  was recorded in pensacola  the tropical storm weakened as it moved over land  degenerating to a tropical depression on september the system became increasingly diffuse  and later merged with strong weather systems by 0600  utc later that the tropical storm generated high tides 2.5–4  ft (0.76–1.22  m  above average in apalachee bay  located about 150  mi (240  km  east of where debbie made landfall  the strong surf caused some localized flooding  in st  marks  florida  a station recorded maximum sustained winds of 40  mph (65  km h   the highest measured in association with the storm  however  a station in tampa  florida recorded a peak wind gust of 52  mph (84  km h  in a heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding  though rainfall was mostly beneficial to crops  rainfall peaked at 11.26  in (286  mm  in wewahitchka  while precipitation was reported as far north as the tropical storm only caused minor but was indirectly responsible for four september 12,  a mid-level  circulation area formed over nicaragua and slowly drifted northeastward into the gulf of as it entered the gulf  the system developed thunderstorm activity and an area of low pressure  and as a result the weather bureau began initiating advisories on a newly formed tropical depression by 1800  utc on september the depression quickly intensified and attained tropical storm strength by the next day  at the time  esther had a minimum pressure of 1000  mbar  hpa  29.53  inhg   as reported by a hurricane reconnaissance this would be the lowest pressure measured associated with the large tropical storm intensified to peak winds of 65  mph (105  km h  later that day  and held that intensity before making landfall in southeastern louisiana on the morning on september 18.  esther weakened over land and later dissipated over the mississippi valley by 1200  utc on september tropical storm debbie  which had made landfall just a week prior in the same area  esther s wind impacts were the strongest gust measured associated with the storm was 75  mph (121  km h   as recorded at pensacola international airport  other locations reported similar gusts and strong winds in squalls  heavy rains persisted in the region well after esther moved inland  resulting in high rainfall amounts  rainfall peaked at 18.39  in (467  mm  in quarantine  louisiana  near the mouth of the mississippi river  the heavy rains breached several levees  resulting in severe flooding  particularly in buras  louisiana  although rainfall was beneficial in many places due to an existing drought  cotton  pecan  and peanut crops were damaged by the floods  while crop damage amounted to $1  property damage amounted to $1.5  esther also caused three indirect deaths  all of which were in september 20,  a low pressure area developed within the same frontal boundary that had curved hurricane carrie towards the rapidly developing  the system was classified as a tropical depression at 1200  utc later that day  southwest of initially  the depression was ill-defined  and was slowly moving to the the following day  the attached cold front dissipated  allowing for the system to intensify  the system was subsequently upgraded a tropical storm by september following a reconnaissance flight into the system which reported a minimum pressure of 1001  mbar  hpa  29.56  inhg   at the time  however  frieda was a small system with minimal shower gradually strengthening  frieda reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 60  mph (95  km h  later that following the split of an upper-level  ridge to the north  frieda recurved towards the northeast the next day  as it sped to the northeast  a westerly shortwave progressed eastward  enhancing environmental conditions  as a result  the tropical storm began to quickly strengthen  by 1200  utc on september 25,  frieda attained hurricane strength  and reached peak intensity with winds of 80  mph (130  km h  and a minimum pressure of 992  mbar  hpa  29.30  inhg   as reported by the canadian merchant ship irvingbrook  however  a cold front associated with the shortwave encountered the hurricane  which caused it to transition into an extratropical cyclone on september 26.  frieda s extratropical remnants later passed over though frieda remained far from any land masses  a peak rainfall amount of 3.26  in (83  mm  was measured in october 22,  an area of thunderstorm activity developed north of the lesser antilles  and barometric pressures fell throughout the region  the following day  a cut-off  low developed and strengthened along the edge of a trough extending from this justified the classification of the system as a tropical depression on october 500  mi (800  km  northeast of puerto moving towards the west  the depression attained tropical storm strength shortly after a ship reported a minimum pressure of 999  mbar  hpa  29.50  inhg  in the storm s the large system gradually strengthened the following day  reaching its peak intensity by 1800  utc on october a ship reported a minimum pressure of 993  mbar  hpa  29.33  inhg  early the next day  the lowest pressure measured in association with the tropical storm  at the same time  the tropical storm also recurved towards the northeast  heading towards more northerly latitudes  a gradual weakening trend began  due to the presence of an extratropical system  the tropical storm was itself absorbed by the same system on october 27.  this storm may not have been named operationally due to a lack of discernible tropical following names were used for tropical cyclones that reached at least tropical storm intensity in the north atlantic in however  two of such storms  the first and last  went the name audrey would later be retired  only the seventh name to do storms were named audrey  bertha  carrie  debbie  esther  and frieda for the first time in
