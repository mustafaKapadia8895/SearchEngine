 the freezing level  or 0  °c (zero-degree)  isotherm  represents the altitude in which the temperature is at 0  °c  the freezing point of water  in a free atmosphere  i e  allowing reflection of the sun by snow  etc    any given measure is valid for only a short period of time  often less than a day above the freezing altitude  the temperature of the air is below freezing  below it  the temperature is above freezing  the profile of this frontier  and its variations  are studied in meteorology  and are used for a variety of forecasts and predictions  whilst not given on general weather forecasts  it is used on bulletins giving forecasts for mountainous areas there are several different methods to examine the structure of the temperature of the atmosphere depending on the frequency and resolution at which these readings are taken  these methods can report the isotherm with greater or lesser precision  radiosondes  for example  only report a reading twice daily and provide very rough information  weather radar can detect a variation every five to ten minutes if there is precipitation  and can scan a radius of up to two kilometres the isotherm can be very stable over a large area  it varies under two conditions these conditions imply that the 0  °c isotherm varies globally
