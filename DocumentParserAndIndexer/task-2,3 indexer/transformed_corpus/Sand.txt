 sand is a naturally occurring granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles  it is defined by size  being finer than gravel and coarser than silt  sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type  i e   a soil containing more than 85  percent sand-sized  particles by composition of sand varies  depending on the local rock sources and conditions  but the most common constituent of sand in inland continental settings and non-tropical  coastal settings is silica  silicon dioxide  or sio2),  usually in the form of quartz  the second most common type of sand is calcium carbonate  for example  aragonite  which has mostly been created  over the past half billion years  by various forms of life  like coral and shellfish  for example  it is the primary form of sand apparent in areas where reefs have dominated the ecosystem for millions of years like the caribbean sand is a non-renewable  resource over human timescales  and sand suitable for making concrete is in high exact definition of sand varies  the scientific unified soil classification system used in engineering and geology corresponds to us standard and defines sand as particles with a diameter of between 0.074  and 4.75  millimeters  by another definition  in terms of particle size as used by geologists  sand particles range in diameter from 0.0625  mm  or 1⁄16  mm  to 2  mm  an individual particle in this range size is termed a sand grain  sand grains are between gravel  with particles ranging from 2  mm up to 64  mm by the latter system  and from 4.75  mm up to 75  mm in the former  and silt  particles smaller than 0.0625  mm down to 0.004  mm   the size specification between sand and gravel has remained constant for more than a century  but particle diameters as small as 0.02  mm were considered sand under the albert atterberg standard in use during the early 20th  century  a 1953  engineering standard published by the american association of state highway and transportation officials set the minimum sand size at 0.074  mm  a 1938  specification of the united states department of agriculture was 0.05  sand feels gritty when rubbed between the fingers  silt  by comparison  feels like flour  iso 14688  grades sands as fine  medium  and coarse with ranges 0.063  mm to 0.2  mm to 0.63  mm to 2.0  mm  in the united states  sand is commonly divided into five sub-categories  based on size  very fine sand   1⁄16  – 1⁄8  mm diameter   fine sand   1⁄8  mm – 1⁄4  mm   medium sand   1⁄4  mm – 1⁄2  mm   coarse sand   1⁄2  mm – 1  mm   and very coarse sand (1  mm – 2  mm   these sizes are based on the krumbein phi scale  where size in φ   -log2d;  d being the particle size in mm  on this scale  for sand the value of φ varies from −1  to +4,  with the divisions between sub-categories  at whole numbers the most common constituent of sand  in inland continental settings and non-tropical  coastal settings  is silica  silicon dioxide  or sio2),  usually in the form of quartz  which  because of its chemical inertness and considerable hardness  is the most common mineral resistant to weathering the composition of mineral sand is highly variable  depending on the local rock sources and conditions  the bright white sands found in tropical and subtropical coastal settings are eroded limestone and may contain coral and shell fragments in addition to other organic or organically derived fragmental material  suggesting sand formation depends on living organisms  the gypsum sand dunes of the white sands national monument in new mexico are famous for their bright  white color  arkose is a sand or sandstone with considerable feldspar content  derived from weathering and erosion of a  usually nearby  granitic rock outcrop  some sands contain magnetite  chlorite  glauconite or gypsum  sands rich in magnetite are dark to black in color  as are sands derived from volcanic basalts and obsidian  chlorite-glauconite  bearing sands are typically green in color  as are sands derived from basaltic  lava  with a high olivine content  many sands  especially those found extensively in southern europe  have iron impurities within the quartz crystals of the sand  giving a deep yellow color  sand deposits in some areas contain garnets and other resistant minerals  including some small gemstones the study of individual grains can reveal much historical information as to the origin and kind of transport of the quartz sand that is recently weathered from granite or gneiss quartz crystals will be angular  it is called grus in geology or sharp sand in the building trade where it is preferred for concrete  and in gardening where it is used as a soil amendment to loosen clay soils  sand that is transported long distances by water or wind will be rounded  with characteristic abrasion patterns on the grain surface  desert sand is typically rounded people who collect sand as a hobby are known as arenophiles  organisms that thrive in sandy environments are some sands are suitable for the construction industry  for example for making concrete  because of the growth of population and of cities and the consequent construction activity there is a huge demand for these special kinds of sand  and natural sources are running low  in 2012  french director denis delestrac made a documentary called  sand wars  about the impact of the lack of construction sand  it shows the ecological and economic effects of both legal and illegal trade in construction many uses require a significant dredging industry  raising environmental concerns over fish depletion  landslides  and countries such as china  indonesia  malaysia and cambodia ban sand exports  citing these issues as a major it is estimated that the annual consumption of sand and gravel is 40  billion tons and sand is a us$70  billion global sand is generally non-toxic,  sand-using  activities such as sandblasting require precautions  bags of silica sand used for sandblasting now carry labels warning the user to wear respiratory protection to avoid breathing the resulting fine silica dust  safety data sheets for silica sand state that  excessive inhalation of crystalline silica is a serious health areas of high pore water pressure  sand and salt water can form quicksand  which is a colloid hydrogel that behaves like a liquid  quicksand produces a considerable barrier to escape for creatures caught within  who often die from exposure  not from submersion  as a result  media related to sand at wikimedia commons
