 the ekman layer is the layer in a fluid where there is a force balance between pressure gradient force  coriolis force and turbulent drag  it was first described by vagn walfrid ekman  ekman layers occur both in the atmosphere and in the ocean there are two types of ekman layers  the first type occurs at the surface of the ocean and is forced by surface winds  which act as a drag on the surface of the ocean  the second type occurs at the bottom of the atmosphere and ocean  where frictional forces are associated with flow over rough surfaces ekman developed the theory of the ekman layer after fridtjof nansen observed that ice drifts at an angle of 20°-40°  to the right of the prevailing wind direction while on an arctic expedition aboard the fram  nansen asked his colleague  vilhelm bjerknes to set one of his students upon study of the problem  bjerknes tapped ekman  who presented his results in 1902  as his doctoral mathematical formulation of the ekman layer begins by assuming a neutrally stratified fluid  a balance between the forces of pressure gradient  coriolis and turbulent drag where u   displaystyle   u  and v   displaystyle   v  are the velocities in the x   displaystyle   x  and y   displaystyle   y  directions  respectively  f   displaystyle   f  is the local coriolis parameter  and k m   displaystyle   k  m   is the diffusive eddy viscosity  which can be derived using mixing length theory  note that p   displaystyle p  is a modified pressure  we have incorporated the hydrostatic of the pressure  to take account of gravity there are many regions where an ekman layer is theoretically plausible  they include the bottom of the atmosphere  near the surface of the earth and ocean  the bottom of the ocean  near the sea floor and at the top of the ocean  near the air-water  interface  different boundary conditions are appropriate for each of these different situations  each of these situations can be accounted for through the boundary conditions applied to the resulting system of ordinary differential equations  the separate cases of top and bottom boundary layers are shown below we will consider boundary conditions of the ekman layer in the upper τ x   displaystyle    tau   x   and τ y   displaystyle    tau   y   are the components of the surface stress  τ   displaystyle    tau     of the wind field or ice layer at the top of the ocean for the boundary condition on the other side  as z → ∞   u → u g   v → v g   displaystyle   z to  infty  u to u  g  v to v  g     where u g   displaystyle   u  g   and v g   displaystyle   v  g   are the geostrophic flows in the x   displaystyle   x  and y   displaystyle   y  directions these differential equations can be solved to find the value d   displaystyle d  is called the ekman layer depth  and gives an indication of the penetration depth of wind-induced  turbulent mixing in the ocean  note that it varies on two parameters  the turbulent diffusivity k m   displaystyle k  m     and the latitude  as encapsulated by f   displaystyle f    for a typical k m   0.1  m 2    s   displaystyle k_{m}=0.1m^{2}/s}    and at 45°  latitude   f   10  − 4  s − 1    displaystyle f=10^{-4}s^{-1}}     then d   displaystyle d  is approximately 45  meters  this ekman depth prediction does not always agree precisely with observations this variation of horizontal velocity with depth   − z   displaystyle -z}    is referred to as the ekman spiral  diagrammed above and at right by applying the continuity equation we can have the vertical velocity as followingnote that when vertically-integrated,  the volume transport associated with the ekman spiral is to the right of the wind direction in the northern hemisphere the traditional development of ekman layers bounded below by a surface utilizes two boundary conditions there is much difficulty associated with observing the ekman layer for two main reasons  the theory is too simplistic as it assumes a constant eddy viscosity  which ekman himself sayingand because it is difficult to design instruments with great enough sensitivity to observe the velocity profile in the ocean the bottom ekman layer can readily be observed in a rotating cylindrical tank of water by dropping in dye and changing the rotation rate surface ekman layers can also be observed in rotating the atmosphere  the ekman solution generally overstates the magnitude of the horizontal wind field because it does not account for the velocity shear in the surface layer  splitting the boundary layer into the surface layer and the ekman layer generally yields more accurate ekman layer  with its distinguishing feature the ekman spiral  is rarely observed in the ocean  the ekman layer near the surface of the ocean extends only about 10  – 20  meters and instrumentation sensitive enough to observe a velocity profile in such a shallow depth has only been available since around also  wind waves modify the flow near the surface  and make observations close to the surface rather of the ekman layer have only been possible since the development of robust surface moorings and sensitive current meters  ekman himself developed a current meter to observe the spiral that bears his name  but was not the vector measuring current meter and the acoustic doppler current profiler are both used to measure current the first documented observations of an ekman-like  spiral in the ocean were made in the arctic ocean from a drifting ice flow in more recent observations include  not an exhaustive list  common to several of these observations spirals were found to be  compressed   displaying larger estimates of eddy viscosity when considering the rate of rotation with depth than the eddy viscosity derived from considering the rate of decay of
