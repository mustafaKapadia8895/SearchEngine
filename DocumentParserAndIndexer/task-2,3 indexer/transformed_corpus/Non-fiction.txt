 non-fiction  or nonfiction is content  sometimes  in the form of a story  whose creator  in good faith  assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events  people  or information in contrast  a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as nonfiction  which may be presented either objectively or subjectively  is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives  and  specifically  prose the other traditional division being fiction  which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information  events  and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary nonfiction s specific factual assertions and descriptions may or may not be accurate  and can give either a true or a false account of the subject in question  however  authors of such accounts genuinely believe or claim them to be truthful at the time of their composition or  at least  pose them to a convinced audience as historically or empirically factual  reporting the beliefs of others in a nonfiction format is not necessarily an endorsement of the ultimate veracity of those beliefs  it is simply saying it is true that people believe them  for such topics as mythology   nonfiction can also be written about fiction  typically known as literary criticism  giving information and analysis on these other works  nonfiction need not necessarily be written text  since pictures and film can also purport to present a factual account of a subject the numerous literary and creative devices used within fiction are generally thought inappropriate for use in nonfiction  they are still present particularly in older works but they are often muted so as not to overshadow the information within the work  simplicity  clarity and directness are some of the most important considerations when producing nonfiction  audience is important in any artistic or descriptive endeavor  but it is perhaps most important in nonfiction  in fiction  the writer believes that readers will make an effort to follow and interpret an indirectly or abstractly presented progression of theme  whereas the production of nonfiction has more to do with the direct provision of information  understanding of the potential readers  use for the work and their existing knowledge of a subject are both fundamental for effective nonfiction  despite the truth of nonfiction  it is often necessary to persuade the reader to agree with the ideas and so a balanced  coherent and informed argument is vital  however  the boundaries between fiction and nonfiction are continually blurred and argued upon  especially in the field of as virginia woolf said   if we think of truth as something of granite-like  solidity and of personality as something of rainbow-like  intangibility and reflect that the aim of biography is to weld these two into one seamless whole  we shall admit that the problem is a stiff one and that we need not wonder if biographers  for the most part failed to solve is fiction implementing a great deal of e g  a fictional description based on a true story common literary examples of nonfiction include expository  argumentative  functional  and opinion pieces  essays on art or literature  biographies  memoirs  journalism  and historical  scientific  technical  or economic writings  including electronic photographs  textbooks  travel books  blueprints  and diagrams are also often considered needed  including information that the author knows to be untrue within any of these works is usually regarded as dishonest  other works can legitimately be either fiction or nonfiction  such as journals of self-expression,  letters  magazine articles  and other expressions of imagination  though they are mostly either one or the other  it is possible for there to be a blend of both  some fiction may include nonfictional elements  some nonfiction may include elements of unverified supposition  deduction  or imagination for the purpose of smoothing out a narrative  but the inclusion of open falsehoods would discredit it as a work of nonfiction  the publishing and bookselling business sometimes uses the phrase  literary nonfiction  to distinguish works with a more literary or intellectual bent  as opposed to the greater collection of nonfiction health security name institutional affiliationnontraditional  health threats after the early cold war  human security got added to the international security agenda  threats to a country were no longer perceived as military based  according to jinping (2014),  non-military  threats  also known as non-traditional  threats began to get factored  among the most common nontraditional security threats included environmental security  climate change  pandemics and social issues  among all the mentioned security threats  health security is one of the most popular risks in developing countries especially in asia  collins  2016).  whether intentionally inflicted or naturally occurring  microbial agents possess the ability to cause sickness  disability  and death in individuals while disrupting state economies  governments  and entire populations  in the highly unified and readily traversed ‘world village’ of the modern era  one country’s problem soon becomes every other country’s crisis as political and geographical boundaries offer minor impediments to such threats  it is important to highlight the social risks posed by health security  as a traditional and nontraditional  it is also imperative to focus why some countries need to be wary of the impending threats from poor health security programs  health security is considered as a nontraditional health threat because it is a modern concept in national security compared to traditional ideas such as military threats  health security is also regarded as non-traditional  because it does not directly affect a country’s security  the world underwent significant shifts in the 20th  century in the form of two deadly and reserves draining world wars  the formation of a bipolar world  proxy wars  emergence of the united states as a sole world superpower and the end of the cold war  however  in the early twentieth century  the impact of intra-state  conflicts  the rise of non-state  actors  environmental degeneration demographic changes and the swiftly escalating cyber warfare arena replaced the main threats to a country’s security  the critical changes in the 21st  century made significant focus shift on security unlike the previous times  in which the most feared security threats were other nation’s militaries  health threat is therefore considered a nontraditional or a modern security threat because it came into the spotlight as a national threat in the early twentieth century  health security is also directly affected by other nontraditional health threats such as climate change and environmental degradation  in the modern times  nations view and treat national security as an unconventional security threat due to significant changes that cause occurrence and spread of diseases and other national pandemics  in the recent past  the united arab emirates and the entire gulf region have experienced a wave of political conflicts which have led to shocking events such as the arab revolution  after the discovery of oil and gas reserved in the uae  the region underwent a significant pattern shift from an impoverished desert region to the sprawling tarmac and skyscraper cities  the rapid cultural and economic transformation is a substantial reason for dilapidation of health security in the uae  according to the who  a normal uae man life expectancy is 76  years while a third of the male inhabitants suffer from some form of health issue  the world health organization also reports that the most frequent health complication is cardiovascular disease  a study by the world health association also indicates that one in four uae men have poor sperm quality  a condition which gets caused by poor diet and the region’s scorching temperatures  the other reason the united arab emirates need to worry about nontraditional health issues is due to the rising number of immigrants  heymann  chen  takemi  fidler  tappero  thomas   kalache  2015).  in the early twenties century  the uae was relatively a small region with few thousand citizens  but the economic boom caused a rise in labor demand which saw many workers and investors move to the area  the new visitors may bring and spread new infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and aids into the uae  another reason the united arab emirates need to be concerned about traditional threats from health security is environmental degradation  particularly climate change and its impacts  burgeoning energy needs and rising population in the uae has led to excessive depletion of resources and overdevelopment of land  a factor which directly affects the health of its citizens  climate change has taken a very vital importance in the uae  a region which is naturally hot due to its geographical location  kickbusch  orbinski  winkler   schnabel  2015).  lack of clean water sources in the uae is another critical health concern that should worry the government  as the saying goes “water is life ” lack of fresh water sources guarantees occurrence and spread of water bound diseases such as typhoid and cholera  while most government officials solely focused on military based and terror threats  the condition might be eating through uae security undetected  according to kutzin   sparkes (2016),  the inadequate medical staff is another health security threat in the united arab emirates  as health experts estimate  if demand for healthcare services rises  then logic dictates that more doctors and medical specialists are needed to cope in a region that does not produce enough graduates and depends on medical staff from abroad  studies indicate that a shortage of nurses and midwives still exist despite a campaign to make the medical profession more attractive and lucrative through initiatives such as better salaries and working conditions (maier-knapp,  2014).  recent studies show that there are over 803,000  diabetics in the united arab emirates  the research by the international diabetics federation suggests that the number will rise by more than 80  percent to 3  million by 2035  unless action gets taken  studies indicate that the rate of obesity in the uae is almost double that of the entire world  obesity is an effect of pitiable diet and lack of exercise  habits caused by the affluent lifestyle by the uae nationals  cancer is another reason the uae should worry about traditional security  it is one of the most common killers in the gulf region  according to health authority abu dhabi research  women accounted for about 45  percent of the total cancer-related  deaths in the uae  with breast cancer the most common in blood and lung cancers  in conclusion  the uae should  and other developing nations should embrace the need to strengthen disease surveillance to stop and prevent disease spread  zimmerman  (2016)  indicates that the uae capacity to deal with microbial threats to national health is contingent on a national health infrastructure that has declined due to many years of neglect and ignorance  the uae government and other developing countries should upgrade their existing domestic health programs which require increased investment across diverse levels of government  support will have to get regularly sustained  the uae also has an opportunity to develop new policies and programs that will both protect against disease and aid in the fast and reliable treatment of diseases
