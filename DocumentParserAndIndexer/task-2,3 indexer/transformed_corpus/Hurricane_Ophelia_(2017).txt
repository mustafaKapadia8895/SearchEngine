 hurricane ophelia  known as storm ophelia in ireland and the united kingdom while extratropical  was the easternmost atlantic major hurricane on record  the tenth consecutive hurricane and the sixth major hurricane of the very active 2017  atlantic hurricane season  ophelia had non-tropical  origins from a decaying cold front on 6  october  located within a favorable environment  the storm steadily strengthened over the next two days  drifting north and then southeastwards before becoming a hurricane on 11  october  after becoming a category 2  hurricane and fluctuating in intensity for a day  ophelia intensified into a major hurricane on 14  october south of the azores  brushing the archipelago with high winds and heavy rainfall  shortly after achieving peak intensity  ophelia began weakening as it accelerated over progressively colder waters to its northeast towards ireland and great britain  completing an extratropical transition early on 16  october  ophelia became the second storm of the 2017–18  uk and ireland windstorm season  early on 17  october  the cyclone crossed the north sea and struck western norway  with wind gusts up to 70  kilometres per hour (43  mph  in rogaland county  before weakening during the evening  the system made additional landfalls in sweden and finland before dissipating over russia three deaths can be direcly attributed to ophelia  all of which occurred in ireland  the total losses from the storm are estimated at €1  billion (us$1.18  billion   mostly from economic losses  insured damage claims as of 24  october reached €6  million (us$7  million  in ireland and £5–10  million (us$6.6–13.2  million  in the united kingdom on 6  october  the united states  national hurricane center  nhc  began monitoring the tail end of a decaying cold front for possible subtropical or tropical on the same day  a circulation developed on the periphery of this soon afterwards  a non-tropical  low developed within the circulation  and drifted to the southwest before becoming nearly the system began to acquire subtropical characteristics on the next day  and the chances of development were raised to a high percentage of after a brief loss of organization and diminished convection  due to moderate wind the system continued to steadily organize  and developed a well-defined  circulation center early on 9  october  as deep convection began to persist near the by 09:00  utc that day  the convection had persisted long enough for the system to be classified as a tropical depression about 875  mi (1,410  km  west-southwest  of the azores  and the storm was identified as tropical depression a curved banding feature wrapped around the center as the satellite presentation improved  leading to the upgrade to tropical storm ophelia six hours marginally warm sea surface temperatures of around 79  °f (26  °c   the effects of below-average  temperatures aloft and low wind shear allowed ophelia to gradually strengthen  with banding features becoming more prominent as it drifted northwards in an area of weak steering in addition  the large temperature contrast between the unusually-warm  ocean surface and the extremely cold temperatures in the upper atmosphere provided instability for ophelia s thunderstorms  which allowed the storm to continue strengthening  despite being over marginally-warm  ocean a slight degradation of the structure of the storm resulted in some weakening early on 11  but this was short-lived  as deep convection wrapped around the entire storm  it was upgraded to a hurricane at 21:00  utc that day after a ragged eye developed  becoming the record-tying  tenth consecutive hurricane to form during the 2017  hurricane season  ophelia was the fourth such occurrence since the 1878,  1886,  and 1893  1]  afterwards  ophelia steadily intensified as it became nearly stationary  intensifying into a category 2  hurricane on the saffir–simpson scale on 12  october  as the central dense overcast became more symmetric and the eye became better hurricane then weakened slightly the on next day  as cloud tops only to quickly strengthen as the eye became much more defined and cloud tops cooled significantly due to outflow from a strong trough to the northeast  the nhc upgraded the storm to a major hurricane  category 3  or higher  at 15:00  utc on 14  october  the farthest east that a storm of such intensity had been observed in the satellite at the same time  it attained its peak intensity with winds of 115  mph (185  km h  and a minimum pressure of 960  millibars (28.35  inhg  while located approximately 235  miles (375  km  southeast of the azores  after peaking in intensity  increasing shear and dry air from an encroaching frontal boundary began to disrupt the core of the storm  which caused ophelia to begin weakening early on 15  october as it began its extratropical transition  with the eye the process accelerated as ophelia became further embedded in the trough  and ultimately  the storm became extratropical at 03:00  utc on the next portuguese institute of the sea and the atmosphere issued a red warning for heavy rainfall for the eastern group of the azores—são miguel  santa maria and formigas—on 14  october from 17:59  utc to 23:59  an orange gale warning was issued for the eastern group for the afternoon through night of 14–15  as well as a yellow alert for high rainfall alerts were also issued for the central group—terceira  graciosa  são jorge island  pico and faial the president of the regional service of civil protection of the azores  lieutnant-colonel  carlos neves  announced there was no serious damage  high winds downed four trees on são miguel  three in the ponta delgada district and one in povoação  the island also experienced some minor flooding  in the central group of the azores  there were a few instances of light damage  with one home suffering a roof on 15  october 2017,  winds from hurricane ophelia fanned wildfires in both portugal and spain  the wildfires have claimed the lives of at least 49  individuals  including 45  in portugal and four in spain  and dozens more were in portugal  more than 4,000  firefighters are battling around 150  éireann  ireland s national meteorological service  reported on 12  october that the storm would reach ireland  on 14  october  it issued a  status red  warning

the dust from the sahara reached us   meteorologist taimi paljak ophelia was the easternmost major hurricane  at category 3  intensity or higher  ever observed in the north atlantic hurricane ophelia s intensification into a hurricane also made the 2017  atlantic hurricane season the fourth such season to see 10  consecutive hurricanes  after the 1878,  1886,  and 1893  seasons  as far as records 1]climate  scientist reindert haarsma of the royal netherlands meteorological institute said that climate change is likely to cause europe to see more hurricanes like ophelia  as the oceans get warmer  although they were still comparing their model s results  previously reported in 2013)  with those from other climate
