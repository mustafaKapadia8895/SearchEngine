 shortwave radiation  sw  is radiant energy with wavelengths in the visible  vis   near-ultraviolet   uv   and near-infrared   nir  spectra there is no standard cut-off  for the near-infrared  range  therefore  the shortwave radiation range is also variously defined  it may be broadly defined to include all radiation with a wavelength between 0.1μm  and 5.0μm  or narrowly defined so as to include only radiation between 0.2μm  and 3.0μm.there  is little radiation flux  in terms of w m²  to the earth s surface below 0.2μm  or above 3.0μm,  although photon flux remains significant as far as 6.0μm,  compared to shorter wavelength fluxes  uv-c  radiation spans from 0.1μm  to .28μm,  uv-b  from 0.28μm  to 0.315μm,  uv-a  from 0.315μm  to 0.4μm,  the visible spectrum from 0.4μm  to 0.7μm,  and nir arguably from 0.7μm  to 5.0μm,  beyond which the infrared is radiation is distinguished from longwave radiation  downward shortwave radiation is sensitive to solar zenith angle  cloud cover and surface
