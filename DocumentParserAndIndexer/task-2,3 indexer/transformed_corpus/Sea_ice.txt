 sea ice arises as seawater freezes  because ice is less dense than water  it floats on the ocean s surface  as does fresh water ice  which has an even lower density   sea ice covers about 7%  of the earth’s surface and about 12%  of the world’s much of the world s sea ice is enclosed within the polar ice packs in the earth s polar regions  the arctic ice pack of the arctic ocean and the antarctic ice pack of the southern ocean  polar packs undergo a significant yearly cycling in surface extent  a natural process upon which depends the arctic ecology  including the ocean s ecosystems  due to the action of winds  currents and temperature fluctuations  sea ice is very dynamic  leading to a wide variety of ice types and features  sea ice may be contrasted with icebergs  which are chunks of ice shelves or glaciers that calve into the ocean  depending on location  sea ice expanses may also incorporate icebergs sea ice does not simply grow and melt  during its lifespan  it is very dynamic  due to the combined action of winds  currents  water temperature  and air temperature fluctuations  sea ice expanses typically undergo a significant amount of deformation  sea ice is classified according to whether or not it is able to drift  and according to its age sea ice can be classified according to whether or not it is attached  or frozen  to the shoreline  or between shoals or to grounded icebergs   if attached  it is called landfast ice  or more often  fast ice  from fastened   alternatively  and unlike fast ice  drift ice occurs further offshore in very wide areas  and encompasses ice that is free to move with currents and winds  the physical boundary between fast ice and drift ice is the fast ice boundary  the drift ice zone may be further divided into a shear zone  a marginal ice zone and a central drift ice consists of floes  individual pieces of sea ice 20  metres (66  ft  or more across  there are names for various floe sizes  small – 20  metres (66  ft  to 100  metres (330  ft   medium – 100  metres (330  ft  to 500  metres (1,600  ft   big – 500  metres (1,600  ft  to 2,000  metres (6,600  ft   vast – 2  kilometres (1.2  mi  to 10  kilometres (6.2  mi   and giant – more than 10  kilometres (6.2  the term pack ice is used either as a synonym to drift or to designate drift ice zone in which the floes are densely the overall sea ice cover is termed the ice canopy from the perspective of submarine classification used by scientists to describe sea ice is based on age  that is  on its development stages  these stages are  new ice  nilas  young ice  first-year  and ice is a general term used for recently frozen sea water that does not yet make up solid ice  it may consist of frazil ice  plates or spicules of ice suspended in water   slush  water saturated snow   or shuga  spongy white ice lumps a few centimeters across   other terms  such as grease ice and pancake ice  are used for ice crystal accumulations under the action of wind and waves nilas designates a sea ice crust up to 10  centimetres (3.9  in  in thickness  it bends without breaking around waves and swells  nilas can be further subdivided into dark nilas – up to 5  centimetres (2.0  in  in thickness and very dark  and light nilas – over 5  centimetres (2.0  in  in thickness and lighter in color young ice is a transition stage between nilas and first-year  ice  and ranges in thickness from 10  centimetres (3.9  in  to 30  centimetres (12  in   young ice can be further subdivided into grey ice – 10  centimetres (3.9  in  to 15  centimetres (5.9  in  in thickness  and grey-white  ice – 15  centimetres (5.9  in  to 30  centimetres (12  in  in thickness  young ice is not as flexible as nilas  but tends to break under wave action  in a compression regime  it will either raft  at the grey ice stage  or ridge  at the grey-white  ice stage).first-year  sea ice is ice that is thicker than young ice but has no more than one year growth  in other words  it is ice that grows in the fall and winter  after it has gone through the new ice — nilas — young ice stages and grows further  but does not survive the spring and summer months  it melts away   the thickness of this ice typically ranges from 0.3  metres (0.98  ft  to 2  metres (6.6  first-year  ice may be further divided into thin (30  centimetres (0.98  ft  to 70  centimetres (2.3  ft    medium (70  centimetres (2.3  ft  to 120  centimetres (3.9  ft   and thick (>120  centimetres (3.9  sea ice is sea ice that has survived at least one melting season  i e  one summer   for this reason  this ice is generally thicker than first-year  sea ice  old ice is commonly divided into two types  second-year  ice  which has survived one melting season  and multiyear ice  which has survived more than one   in some old ice is more than 2-years  old   multi-year  ice is much more common in the arctic than it is in the the reason for this is that sea ice in the south drifts into warmer waters where it melts  in the arctic  much of the sea ice is land-locked.while  fast ice is relatively stable  because it is attached to the shoreline or the seabed   drift  or pack  ice undergoes relatively complex deformation processes that ultimately give rise to sea ice’s typically wide variety of landscapes  wind is thought to be the main driving force along with ocean the coriolis force and sea ice surface tilt have also been these driving forces induce a state of stress within the drift ice zone  an ice floe converging toward another and pushing against it will generate a state of compression at the boundary between both  the ice cover may also undergo a state of tension  resulting in divergence and fissure opening  if two floes drift sideways past each other while remaining in contact  this will create a state of shear sea ice deformation results from the interaction between ice floes  as they are driven against each other  the end result may be of three types of 1)  rafted ice  when one piece is overriding another  2)  pressure ridges  a line of broken ice forced downward  to make up the keel  and upward  to make the sail   and 3)  hummock  an hillock of broken ice that forms an uneven surface  a shear ridge is a pressure ridge that formed under shear – it tends to be more linear than a ridge induced only by a new ridge is a recent feature — it is sharp-crested,  with its side sloping at an angle exceeding 40  degrees  in contrast  a weathered ridge is one with a rounded crest and with sides sloping at less than 40  stamukhi are yet another type of pile-up  but these are grounded and are therefore relatively stationary  they result from the interaction between fast ice and the drifting pack ice level ice is sea ice that has not been affected by deformation  and is therefore relatively and polynyas are areas of open water that occur within sea ice expanses even though air temperatures are below freezing  and provide a direct interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere  which is important for the wildlife  leads are narrow and linear – they vary in width from meter to km scale  during the winter  the water in leads quickly freezes up  they are also used for navigation purposes – even when refrozen  the ice in leads is thinner  allowing icebreakers access to an easier sail path  and submarines to surface more easily  polynyas are more uniform in size than leads and are also larger – two types are recognized  1)  sensible-heat  polynyas  caused by the upwelling of warmer water and 2)  latent-heat  polynyas  resulting from persistent winds from the

to the freezing convection of the surface layer involves the top 100  – 150  m  down to the pycnocline of increased density in calm water  the first sea ice to form on the surface is a skim of separate crystals which initially are in the form of tiny discs  floating flat on the surface and of diameter less than 0.3  centimetres (0.12  in   each disc has its c-axis  vertical and grows outwards laterally  at a certain point such a disc shape becomes unstable  and the growing isolated crystals take on a hexagonal  stellar form  with long fragile arms stretching out over the surface  these crystals also have their c-axis  vertical  the dendritic arms are very fragile  and soon break off  leaving a mixture of discs and arm fragments  with any kind of turbulence in the water  these fragments break up further into random-shaped  small crystals which form a suspension of increasing density in the surface water  an ice type called frazil or grease ice  in quiet conditions the frazil crystals soon freeze together to form a continuous thin sheet of young ice  in its early stages  when it is still transparent — that is the ice called nilas  once nilas has formed  a quite different growth process occurs  in which water freezes on to the bottom of the existing ice sheet  a process called congelation growth  this growth process yields first-year  ice in rough water  fresh sea ice is formed by the cooling of the ocean as heat is lost into the atmosphere  the uppermost layer of the ocean is supercooled to slightly below the freezing point  at which time tiny ice platelets  frazil ice  form  with time  this process leads to a mushy surface layer  known as grease ice  frazil ice formation may also be started by snowfall  rather than supercooling  waves and wind then act to compress these ice particles into larger plates  of several meters in diameter  called pancake ice  these float on the ocean surface  and collide with one another  forming upturned edges  in time  the pancake ice plates may themselves be rafted over one another or frozen together into a more solid ice cover  known as consolidated pancake ice  such ice has a very rough appearance on top and bottom if sufficient snow falls on sea ice to depress the freeboard below sea level  sea water will flow in and a layer of ice will form of mixed snow sea water  this is particularly common around antarctica russian scientist vladimir vize (1886–1954)  devoted his life to study the arctic ice pack and developed the scientific prediction of ice conditions theory  for which he was widely acclaimed in academic circles  he applied this theory in the field in the kara sea  which led to the discovery of vize island sea ice freezes and melts due to a combination of factors  including the age of the ice  air temperatures  and solar insolation  during the winter the area of the arctic ocean covered by sea ice increases  usually reaching a maximum extent during the month of march  the area covered in sea ice then decreases  reaching its minimum extent in september most years  first-year  ice melts more easily than older ice for two reasons  1)  first-year  ice is thinner than older ice  since the process of congelation growth has had less time to operate  and 2)  first-year  ice is less permeable than older ice  so summer meltwater tends to form deeper ponds on the first-year  ice surface than on older ice  and deeper ponds mean lower albedo and thus greater solar energy capture changes in sea ice conditions are best demonstrated by the rate of melting over time  a composite record of arctic ice demonstrates that the floes’ retreat began around 1900,  experiencing more rapid melting beginning within the past 50  years  satellite study of sea ice began in 1979,  and became a much more reliable measure of ice melt and polar climate change  in comparison to the extended record  the sea-ice  extent in the polar region by september 2007  was only half the recorded mass that had been estimated to exist within the 1950–1970  volume of ice hit an all-time  low in september 2012,  when the ice was determined to cover only 24%  of the arctic ocean  offsetting the previous low of 29%  in 2007.  future predictions cast that summer sea ice might disappear altogether as soon as during the warmest years  like the winter of 2005–2006,  sea ice is observed to reach a winter maximum extent that is smaller than in the years before or after  the summer minimum arctic ice extent for 2010  was the third lowest over the period of satellite observations of the polar order to gain a better understanding about the variability  numerical sea ice models are used to perform sensitivity studies  the two main ingredients are the ice dynamics and the thermodynamical properties  see sea ice emissivity modelling  sea ice growth processes and sea ice thickness  many global climate models  gcms  have sea ice implemented in their numerical simulation scheme in order to capture the ice-albedo  feedback correctly  examples are the coupled model intercomparison project  cmip  offers a standard protocol for studying the output of coupled atmosphere-ocean  general circulation models  the coupling takes place at the atmosphere-ocean  interface where the sea ice may occur in addition to global modeling  various regional models deal with sea ice  regional models are employed for seasonal forecasting experiments and for process studies sea ice is part of the earth s biosphere  when sea water freezes  the ice is riddled with brine-filled  channels which sustain sympagic organisms such as bacteria  algae  copepods and annelids  which in turn provide food for animals such as krill and specialised fish like the bald notothen  fed upon in turn by larger animals such as emperor penguins and minke decline of seasonal sea ice puts the survival of arctic species such as ringed seals and polar bears at ice provides an ecosystem for various polar species  particularly the polar bear  whose environment is being threatened as global warming causes the ice to melt more as the earth’s temperature gets warmer  furthermore  the sea ice itself functions to help keep polar climates cool  since the ice exists in expansive enough amounts to maintain a cold environment  at this  sea ice’s relationship with global warming is cyclical  the ice helps to maintain cool climates  but as the global temperature increases  the ice melts  and is less effective in keeping those climates cold  the bright  shiny surface  albedo  of the ice also serves a role in maintaining cooler polar temperatures by reflecting much of the sunlight that hits it back into space  as the sea ice melts  its surface area shrinks  diminishing the size of the reflective surface and therefore causing the earth to absorb more of the sun’s heat  though the size of the ice floes is affected by the seasons  even a small change in global temperature can greatly affect the amount of sea ice  and due to the shrinking reflective surface that keeps the ocean cool  this sparks a cycle of ice shrinking and temperatures warming  as a result  the polar regions are the most susceptible places to climate change on the sea ice affects the movement of ocean waters  in the freezing process  much of the salt in ocean water is squeezed out of the frozen crystal formations  though some remains frozen in the ice  this salt becomes trapped beneath the sea ice  creating a higher concentration of salt in the water beneath ice floes  this concentration of salt contributes to the salinated water’s density  and this cold  denser water sinks to the bottom of the ocean  this cold water moves along the ocean floor towards the equator  while warmer water on the ocean surface moves in the direction of the poles  this is referred to as  conveyor belt motion   and is a regularly occurring in extent of the arctic sea ice between april and august  in 2013.sea
