 snowmaking is the production of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a  snow gun   also known as a  snow cannon   on ski slopes  snowmaking is mainly used at ski resorts to supplement natural snow  this allows ski resorts to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring  indoor ski slopes often use snowmaking  they can generally do so year-round  as they have a climate-controlled  environment the production of snow requires low temperatures  the threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases  wet bulb temperature is used as a metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account  snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy use  thereby limiting its use art hunt  dave richey  and wayne pierce invented the snow cannon in but secured a patent sometime in 1952,  grossinger s catskill resort hotel became the first in the world to use artificial snowmaking began to be used extensively in the early 1970s.  many ski resorts depend heavily upon snowmaking snowmaking has achieved greater efficiency with increasing complexity  traditionally  snowmaking quality depended upon the skill of the equipment operator  computer control supplements that skill with greater precision  such that a snow gun operates only when snowmaking is optimal  all-weather  snowmakers have been developed by key considerations in snow production are increasing water and energy efficiency and increasing the environmental window in which snow can be made snowmaking plants require water pumps and sometimes air compressors when using lances  that are both very large and expensive  the energy required to make artificial snow is about 0.6  -  0.7  kw h m³ for lances and 1  -  2  kw h m³ for fan guns  the density of artificial snow is between 400  and 500  kg m³ and the water consumption for producing snow is roughly equal to that begins with a water supply such as a river or reservoir  water is pushed up a pipeline on the mountain using very large electric pumps in a pump house  this water is distributed through an intricate series of valves and pipes to any trails that require snowmaking  many resorts also add a nucleating agent to ensure that as much water as possible freezes and turns into snow  these products are organic or inorganic materials that facilitate the water molecules to form the proper shape to freeze into ice crystals  the products are non-toxic  and biodegradable the next step in the snowmaking process is to add air using an air plant  this plant is often a building which contains electric or diesel industrial air compressors the size of a van or truck  however  in some instances air compression is provided using diesel-powered,  portable trailer-mounted  compressors which can be added to the system  many fan-type  snow guns have on-board  electric air compressors  which allows for cheaper  and more compact operation  a ski area may have the required high-output  water pumps  but not an air pump  onboard compressors are cheaper and easier than having a dedicated pumping house  the air is generally cooled and excess moisture is removed before it is sent out of the plant  some systems even cool the water before it enters the system  this improves the snowmaking process as the less heat in the air and water  the less heat must be dissipated to the atmosphere to freeze the water  from this plant the air travels up a separate pipeline following the same path as the water pipeline the water is sometimes mixed with ina  ice nucleation-active)  proteins from the bacterium pseudomonas syringae  these proteins serve as effective nuclei to initiate the formation of ice crystals at relatively high temperatures  so that the droplets will turn into ice before falling to the ground  the bacterium itself uses these ina proteins in order to injure pipes following the trails are equipped with shelters containing hydrants  electrical power and  optionally  communication lines mounted  whereas shelters for fan guns require only water  power and maybe communication  lance-shelters  usually need air hydrants as well  hybrid shelters allow maximum flexibility to connect each snow machine type as they have all supplies available  the typical distance for lance shelters is 100–150  feet (30–46  m   for fan guns 250–300  feet (76–91  m   from these hydrants 1  1⁄2"–2"  pressure resistant hoses are connected similar to fire hoses with camlocks to the snow machine there are many forms of snowmaking guns  however  they all share the basic principle of combining air and water to form snow  for most guns the type or  quality  of snow can be changed by regulating the amount of water in the mixture  for others  the water and air are simply on or off and the snow quality is determined by the air temperature and humidity in general there are three types of snowmaking guns  internal mixing  external mixing and fan guns  these come in two main styles of makers  air water guns and fan guns an air water gun can be mounted on a tower or on a stand on the ground  it uses higher pressure water and air  while a fan gun uses a powerful axial fan to propel the water jet to a great distance a modern snow fan usually consists of one or more rings of nozzles which inject water into the fan air stream  a separate nozzle or small group of nozzles is fed with a mix of water and compressed air and produces the nucleation points for the snow crystals  the small droplets of water and the tiny ice crystals are then mixed and propelled out by a powerful fan  after which they further cool through evaporation in the surrounding air as they fall to the ground  the crystals of ice act as seeds to make the water droplets freeze at 0  °c (32  °f   without these crystals the water would supercool instead of freezing  this method can produce snow when the wet-bulb  temperature of the air is as high as -1  °c (30.2  the lower the air temperature is  the more and the better snow a cannon can make  this is one of the main reasons snow cannons are usually operated in the night  the quality of the mixing of the water and air streams and their relative pressures is crucial to the amount of snow made and its quality modern snow cannons are fully computerized and can operate autonomously or be remotely controlled from a central location  operational parameters are  starting and stopping time  quality of snow  maximum wet-bulb  temperature in which to operate  maximum windspeed  horizontal and vertical orientation  and sweep angle  to cover a wider or narrower area   sweep angle and area may follow wind direction smaller versions of the snow machines found at ski resorts exist  scaled down to run off household size air and water supplies  home snowmakers receive their water supply either from a garden hose or from a pressure washer  which makes more snow per hour  plans also exist for do-it-yourself  snowmaking machines made out of plumbing fittings and special nozzles volumes of snow output by home snowmakers depend on the air water mixture  temperature  wind variations  pumping capacity  water supply  air supply  and other factors  using a household spray bottle will not work unless temperatures are well below the freezing point of water in swedish  the phrase  snow cannon   snökanon  is used to designate the lake-effect  snow weather phenomenon  for example  if the baltic sea is not yet frozen in january  cold winds from siberia may lead to
