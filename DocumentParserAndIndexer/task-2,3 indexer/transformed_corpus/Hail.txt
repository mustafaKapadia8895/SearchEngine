 hail is a form of solid precipitation  it is distinct from ice pellets  american sleet   though the two are often it consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice  each of which is called a hailstone  ice pellets  american sleet  falls generally in cold weather while hail growth is greatly inhibited during cold surface other forms of water ice such as graupel  which is made of rime  and ice pellets  which are smaller and translucent  hailstones usually measure between 5  millimetres (0.2  in  and 15  centimetres (6  in  in diameter  the metar reporting code for hail 5  mm (0.20  in  or greater is gr  while smaller hailstones and graupel are coded gs hail is possible within most thunderstorms as it is produced by and within 2  nautical miles (3.7  km  of the parent storm  hail formation requires environments of strong  upward motion of air with the parent thunderstorm  similar to tornadoes  and lowered heights of the freezing level  in the mid-latitudes,  hail forms near the interiors of continents  while in the tropics  it tends to be confined to high elevations there are methods available to detect hail-producing  thunderstorms using weather satellites and weather radar imagery  hailstones generally fall at higher speeds as they grow in size  though complicating factors such as melting  friction with air  wind  and interaction with rain and other hailstones can slow their descent through earth s atmosphere  severe weather warnings are issued for hail when the stones reach a damaging size  as it can cause serious damage to human-made  structures and  most commonly  farmers  crops any thunderstorm which produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hail has a diameter of 5  millimetres (0.20  in  or hailstones can grow to 15  centimetres (6  in  and weigh more than 0.5  kilograms (1.1  ice pellets  hailstones are layered and can be irregular and clumped together  hail is composed of transparent ice or alternating layers of transparent and translucent ice at least 1  millimetre (0.039  in  thick  which are deposited upon the hailstone as it travels through the cloud  suspended aloft by air with strong upward motion until its weight overcomes the updraft and falls to the ground  although the diameter of hail is varied  in the united states  the average observation of damaging hail is between 2.5  cm (1  in  and golf ball-sized  (1.75  larger than 2  cm (0.80  in  are usually considered large enough to cause damage  the meteorological service of canada issues severe thunderstorm warnings when hail that size or above is the us national weather service has a 2.5  cm (1  in  or greater in diameter threshold  effective january 2010,  an increase over the previous threshold of ¾-inch  other countries have different thresholds according local sensitivity to hail  for instance grape growing areas could be adversely impacted by smaller hailstones  hailstones can be very large or very small  depending on how strong the updraft is  weaker hailstorms produce smaller hailstones than stronger hailstorms  such as supercells  hail forms in strong thunderstorm clouds  particularly those with intense updrafts  high liquid water content  great vertical extent  large water droplets  and where a good portion of the cloud layer is below freezing 0  °c (32  these types of strong updrafts can also indicate the presence of a the growth rate is maximized where air is near a temperature of −13  °c (9  needed like other precipitation in cumulonimbus clouds  hail begins as water droplets  as the droplets rise and the temperature goes below freezing  they become supercooled water and will freeze on contact with condensation nuclei  a cross-section  through a large hailstone shows an onion-like  structure  this means the hailstone is made of thick and translucent layers  alternating with layers that are thin  white and opaque  former theory suggested that hailstones were subjected to multiple descents and ascents  falling into a zone of humidity and refreezing as they were uplifted  this up and down motion was thought to be responsible for the successive layers of the hailstone  new research  based on theory as well as field study  has shown this is not necessarily true the storm s updraft  with upwardly directed wind speeds as high as 110  miles per hour (180  blows the forming hailstones up the cloud  as the hailstone ascends it passes into areas of the cloud where the concentration of humidity and supercooled water droplets varies  the hailstone’s growth rate changes depending on the variation in humidity and supercooled water droplets that it encounters  the accretion rate of these water droplets is another factor in the hailstone’s growth  when the hailstone moves into an area with a high concentration of water droplets  it captures the latter and acquires a translucent layer  should the hailstone move into an area where mostly water vapour is available  it acquires a layer of opaque white the hailstone’s speed depends on its position in the cloud’s updraft and its mass  this determines the varying thicknesses of the layers of the hailstone  the accretion rate of supercooled water droplets onto the hailstone depends on the relative velocities between these water droplets and the hailstone itself  this means that generally the larger hailstones will form some distance from the stronger updraft where they can pass more time as the hailstone grows it releases latent heat  which keeps its exterior in a liquid phase  because it undergoes  wet growth   the outer layer is sticky  i e  more adhesive   so a single hailstone may grow by collision with other smaller hailstones  forming a larger entity with an irregular hailstone will keep rising in the thunderstorm until its mass can no longer be supported by the updraft  this may take at least 30  minutes based on the force of the updrafts in the hail-producing  thunderstorm  whose top is usually greater than 10  km high  it then falls toward the ground while continuing to grow  based on the same processes  until it leaves the cloud  it will later begin to melt as it passes into air above freezing a unique trajectory in the thunderstorm is sufficient to explain the layer-like  structure of the hailstone  the only case in which multiple trajectories can be discussed is in a multicellular thunderstorm  where the hailstone may be ejected from the top of the  mother  cell and captured in the updraft of a more intense  daughter  cell  this  however  is an exceptional is most common within continental interiors of the mid-latitudes,  as hail formation is considerably more likely when the freezing level is below the altitude of 11,000  feet (3,400  movement of dry air into strong thunderstorms over continents can increase the frequency of hail by promoting evaporational cooling which lowers the freezing level of thunderstorm clouds giving hail a larger volume to grow in  accordingly  hail is less common in the tropics despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes  because the atmosphere over the tropics tends to be warmer over a much greater altitude  hail in the tropics occurs mainly at higher growth becomes vanishingly small when air temperatures fall below −30  °c (−22  °f  as supercooled water droplets become rare at these around thunderstorms  hail is most likely within the cloud at elevations above 20,000  feet (6,100  m   between 10,000  feet (3,000  m  and 20,000  feet (6,100  m   60  percent of hail is still within the thunderstorm  though 40  percent now lies within the clear air under the anvil  below 10,000  feet (3,000  m   hail is equally distributed in and around a thunderstorm to a distance of 2  nautical miles (3.7  occurs most frequently within continental interiors at mid-latitudes  and is less common in the tropics  despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the hail is also much more common along mountain ranges because mountains force horizontal winds upwards  known as orographic lifting   thereby intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more the higher elevations also result in there being less time available for hail to melt before reaching the ground  one of the more common regions for large hail is across mountainous northern india  which reported one of the highest hail-related  death tolls on record in china also experiences significant central europe and southern australia also experience a lot of hailstorms  popular regions for hailstorms are southern and western germany  northern and eastern france and southern and eastern benelux  in south-eastern  europe  croatia and serbia experience frequent occurrences of north america  hail is most common in the area where colorado  nebraska  and wyoming meet  known as  hail hail in this region occurs between the months of march and october during the afternoon and evening hours  with the bulk of the occurrences from may through september  cheyenne  wyoming is north america s most hail-prone  city with an average of nine to ten hailstorms per to the north of this area and also just downwind of the rocky mountains is the hailstorm alley region of alberta  which also experiences an increased incidence of significant hail events weather radar is a very useful tool to detect the presence of hail-producing  thunderstorms  however  radar data has to be complemented by a knowledge of current atmospheric conditions which can allow one to determine if the current atmosphere is conducive to hail development modern radar scans many angles around the site  reflectivity values at multiple angles above ground level in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels  summing reflectivities in the vertically integrated liquid or vil  gives the liquid water content in the cloud  research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm is related to the evolution of vil  vil divided by the vertical extent of the storm  called vil density  has a relationship with hail size  although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly traditionally  hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research  some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground certain patterns of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well  the three body scatter spike is an example  this is the result of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground  where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar  the energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back  as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar  and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path  forming a cone of weaker reflectivities more recently  the polarization properties of weather radar returns have been analyzed to differentiate between hail and heavy the use of differential reflectivity   z d r   displaystyle z  dr      in combination with horizontal reflectivity   z h   displaystyle z  h     has led to a variety of hail classification visible satellite imagery is beginning to be used to detect hail  but false alarm rates remain high using this size of hailstones is best determined by measuring their diameter with a ruler  in the absence of a ruler  hailstone size is often visually estimated by comparing its size to that of known objects  such as using the objects such as hen s eggs  peas  and marbles for comparing hailstone sizes is imprecise  due to their varied dimensions  the uk organisation  torro  also scales for both hailstones and when observed at an airport  metar code is used within a surface weather observation which relates to the size of the hailstone  within metar code  gr is used to indicate larger hail  of a diameter of at least 0.25  inches (6.4  mm   gr is derived from the french word grêle  smaller-sized  hail  as well as snow pellets  use the coding of gs  which is short for the french word large rocks of ice that are not associated with thunderstorms  are not officially recognized by the world meteorological organization as  hail   which are aggregations of ice associated with thunderstorms  and therefore records of extreme characteristics of megacryometeors are not given as hail records terminal velocity of hail  or the speed at which hail is falling when it strikes the ground  varies  it is estimated that a hailstone of 1  centimetre (0.39  in  in diameter falls at a rate of 9  metres per second (20  mph   while stones the size of 8  centimetres (3.1  in  in diameter fall at a rate of 48  metres per second (110  mph   hailstone velocity is dependent on the size of the stone  friction with air it is falling through  the motion of wind it is falling through  collisions with raindrops or other hailstones  and melting as the stones fall through a warmer atmosphere  as hail stones are not perfect spheres it is difficult to calculate their speed can cause serious damage  notably to automobiles  aircraft  skylights  glass-roofed  structures  livestock  and most commonly  farmers  hail damage to roofs often goes unnoticed until further structural damage is seen  such as leaks or cracks  it is hardest to recognize hail damage on shingled roofs and flat roofs  but all roofs have their own hail damage detection metal roofs are fairly resistant to hail damage  but may accumulate cosmetic damage in the form of dents and damaged is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to when hailstones exceed 0.5  inches (13  mm  in diameter  planes can be seriously damaged within the hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft  hail is also a common nuisance to drivers of automobiles  severely denting the vehicle and cracking or even shattering windshields and windows  wheat  corn  soybeans  and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail hail is one of canada s most expensive rarely  massive hailstones have been known to cause concussions or fatal head trauma  hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history  one of the earliest known incidents occurred around the 9th  century in roopkund  uttarakhand  india  where 200  to 600  nomads seem to have died of injuries from hail the size of cricket the largest hailstone in terms of diameter and weight ever recorded in the united states fell on july 23,  2010  in vivian  south dakota  it measured 8  inches (20  cm  in diameter and 18.62  inches (47.3  cm  in circumference  weighing in at 1.93  pounds (0.88  this broke the previous record for diameter set by a hailstone 7  inches diameter and 18.74  inches circumference  still the greatest circumference hailstone  which fell in aurora  nebraska in the united states on june 22,  2003,  as well as the record for weight  set by a hailstone of 1.67  pounds (0.76  kg  that fell in coffeyville  kansas in zones where hail accumulates on the ground in association with thunderstorm activity are known as hail streaks or hail which can be detectable by satellite after the storms pass hailstorms normally last from a few minutes up to 15  minutes in accumulating hail storms can blanket the ground with over 2  inches (5.1  cm  of hail  cause thousands to lose power  and bring down many trees  flash flooding and mudslides within areas of steep terrain can be a concern with accumulating of up to 18  in (0.46  m  have been reported  a landscape covered in accumulated hail generally resembles one covered in accumulated snow and any significant accumulation of hail has the same restrictive effects as snow accumulation  albeit over a smaller area  on transport and accumulated hail can also cause flooding by blocking drains  and hail can be carried in the floodwater  turning into a snow-like  slush which is deposited at lower elevations on somewhat rare occasions  a thunderstorm can become stationary or nearly so while prolifically producing hail and significant depths of accumulation do occur  this tends to happen in mountainous areas  such as the july 29,  2010  of a foot of hail accumulation in boulder county  colorado  on june 5,  2015,  hail up to four feet deep fell on one city block in denver  colorado  the hailstones  described as between the size of bumble bees and ping pong balls  were accompanied by rain and high winds  the hail fell in only the one area  leaving the surrounding area untouched  it fell for one and a half hours between 10  p m  and 11:30  p m  a meteorologist for the national weather service in boulder said   it s a very interesting phenomenon  we saw the storm stall  it produced copious amounts of hail in one small area  it s a meteorological thing   tractors used to clear the area filled more than 30  dump-truck  loads of focused on four individual days that accumulated more than 5.9  inches (15  cm  of hail in 30  minutes on the colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather  radar  and lightning suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence  a fundamental problem in continuing research in this area is that  unlike hail diameter  hail depth is not commonly reported  the lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods  a cooperative effort between the university of colorado and the national weather service is in progress  the joint project s goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation the middle ages  people in europe used to ring church bells and fire cannons to try to prevent hail  and the subsequent damage to crops  updated versions of this approach are available as modern hail cannons  cloud seeding after world war ii was done to eliminate the hail particularly across the soviet union – where it was claimed a 70  to 98  percent reduction in crop damage from hail storms was achieved by deploying silver iodide in clouds using rockets and artillery hail suppression programs have been undertaken by 15  countries between 1965  and
