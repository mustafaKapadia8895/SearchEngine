is the world s primary reserve several countries use it as their official currency  and in many others it is the de facto besides the united states  it is also used as the sole currency in two british overseas territories in the caribbean  the british virgin islands and turks and caicos islands  a few countries use the federal reserve notes for paper money  while still minting their own coins  or also accept u s  dollar coins  such as the susan b  anthony dollar   as of july 12,  2017,  there was approximately $1.56  trillion in circulation  of which $1.52  trillion was in federal reserve notes  the remaining $40  billion is in the form of i  section 8  of the u s  constitution provides that the congress has the power  to coin laws implementing this power are currently codified at 31

one example of the copper alloy dollar  the pure silver dollar is known as the american silver eagle  section 5112  also provides for the minting and issuance of other coins  which have values ranging from one cent to 100  these other coins are more fully described in coins of the united states dollar the constitution provides that  a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to that provision of the constitution is made specific by section 331  of title 31  of the united states the sums of money reported in the  statements  are currently being expressed in u s  dollars  for example  see the 2009  financial report of the united states the u s  dollar may therefore be described as the unit of account of the united states the word  dollar  is one of the words in the first paragraph of section 9  of article i of the constitution  there   dollars  is a reference to the spanish milled dollar  a coin that had a monetary value of 8  spanish units of currency  or reales  in 1792  the u s  congress passed a coinage act  section 9  of that act authorized the production of various coins  including  dollars or units—each to be of the value of a spanish milled dollar as the same is now current  and to contain three hundred and seventy-one  grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure  or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver   section 20  of the act provided   that the money of account of the united states shall be expressed in dollars  or units    and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the united states shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation   in other words  this act designated the united states dollar as the unit of currency of the united states unlike the spanish milled dollar  the u s  dollar is based upon a decimal system of values  in addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth  of a dollar  symbol ₥   cent or one-hundredth  of a dollar  symbol ¢   dime or one-tenth  of a dollar  and eagle or ten dollars  with prescribed weights and composition of gold  silver  or copper for each  it was proposed in the mid-1800s  that one hundred dollars be known as a union  but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50  half union exist  however  only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar   dime  is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10¢,  while  eagle  and  mill  are largely unknown to the general public  though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies  and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $x.xx9  per gallon  e g   $3.599,  more commonly written as $3.59  9⁄10.  when currently issued in circulating form  denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as u s  coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as federal reserve notes  with the exception of gold  silver and platinum coins valued up to $100  as legal tender  but worth far more as bullion   both one-dollar  coins and notes are produced today  although the note form is significantly more common  in the past   paper money  was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar  fractional currency  and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20   known as the  double eagle   discontinued in the 1930s).  the term eagle was used in the coinage act of 1792  for the denomination of ten dollars  and subsequently was used in naming gold coins  paper currency less than one dollar in denomination  known as  fractional currency   was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as  shinplasters   in 1854,  james guthrie  then secretary of the treasury  proposed creating $100,  $50  and $25  gold coins  which were referred to as a  union    half union   and  quarter thus implying a denomination of 1  union   $100.today,  usd notes are made from cotton fiber

1914,  have been issued by the federal reserve  the "large-sized  notes  issued before 1928  measured 7.42  by 3.125  inches (188.5  by 79.4  mm   small-sized  notes  introduced that year  measure 6.14  by 2.61  by 0.0043  inches (155.96  by 66.29  by 0.11  mm   when the current  smaller sized u s  currency was introduced it was referred to as philippine-sized  currency because the philippines had previously adopted the same size for its legal currency in the 16th  century  count hieronymus schlick of bohemia began minting coins known as joachimstalers  from german thal  or nowadays usually tal   valley   cognate with  dale  in english   named for joachimstal  the valley where the silver was mined  st  joachim s valley  now jáchymov  then part of the kingdom of bohemia  now part of the czech joachimstaler was later shortened to the german taler  a word that eventually found its way into danish and swedish as daler  norwegian as dalar and daler  dutch as daler or daalder  ethiopian as ታላሪ  talari   hungarian as tallér  italian as tallero  and english as alternatively  thaler is said to come from the german coin guldengroschen   great guilder   being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder   minted from the silver from joachimsthal the coins minted at joachimsthal soon lent their name to other coins of similar size and weight from other places  one such example  was a dutch coin depicting a lion  hence its dutch name leeuwendaler  in english  lion dollar  the leeuwendaler was authorized to contain 427.16  grains of .75  fine silver and passed locally for between 36  and 42  stuivers  it was lighter than the large-denomination  coins then in circulation  thus it was more advantageous for a dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendalers and it became the coin of choice for foreign trade the leeuwendaler was popular in the dutch east indies and in the dutch new netherland colony  new york   and circulated throughout the thirteen colonies during the 17th  and early 18th  centuries  it was also popular throughout eastern europe  where it led to the current romanian and moldovan currency being called leu  literally  lion   among the english-speaking  community  the coin came to be popularly known as lion dollar – and is the origin of the name the modern american-english  pronunciation of dollar is still remarkably close to the 17th-century  dutch pronunciation of analogy with this lion dollar  spanish pesos – with the same weight and shape as the lion dollar – came to be known as spanish by the mid-18th  century  the lion dollar had been replaced by the spanish dollar  the famous  piece of eight   which was distributed widely in the spanish colonies in the new world and in the eventually  dollar became the name of the first official american currency the colloquialism  buck  s   much like the british word  quid  s  pl  for the pound sterling  is often used to refer to dollars of various nations  including the u s  dollar  this term  dating to the 18th  century  may have originated with the colonial leather trade  it may also have originated from a poker  greenback  is another nickname originally applied specifically to the 19th  century demand note dollars created by abraham lincoln to finance the costs of the civil war for the the original note was printed in black and green on the back side  it is still used to refer to the u s  dollar  but not to the dollars of other countries   other well-known  names of the dollar as a whole in denominations include  greenmail    green  and  dead presidents   the last because deceased presidents are pictured on most bills  a  grand   sometimes shortened to simply  g   is a common term for the amount of $1,000.  the suffix  k  or  k   from "kilo-")  is also commonly used to denote this amount  such as "$10k"  to mean $10,000).  however  the $1,000  note is no longer in general use  a  large  or  stack   it is usually a reference to a multiple of $1,000   such as  fifty large  meaning $50,000).  the $100  note is nicknamed  benjamin    benji    ben   or  franklin   after benjamin franklin   "c-note"   c being the roman numeral for 100),   century note  or  bill   e g   two bills  being $200).  the $50  note is occasionally called a  yardstick  or a  grant   after president ulysses s  grant  pictured on the obverse   the $20  note is referred to as a  double sawbuck    jackson   after andrew jackson   or  double eagle   the $10  note is referred to as a  sawbuck   "ten-spot"  or  hamilton   after alexander hamilton   the $5  note as  lincoln    fin    fiver  or "five-spot".  the infrequently-used  $2  note is sometimes called  deuce    tom   or  jefferson   after thomas jefferson   the $1  note as a  single  or  buck   the dollar has also been referred to as a  bone  and  bones  in plural  e g   twenty bones  is equal to $20).  the newer designs  with portraits displayed in the main body of the obverse  rather than in cameo insets   upon paper color-coded  by denomination  are sometimes referred to as  bigface  notes or  monopoly money   piastre  was the original french word for the u s  dollar  used for example in the french text of the louisiana purchase  calling the dollar a piastre is still common among the speakers of cajun french and new england french  modern french uses dollar for this unit of currency as well  the term is still used as slang for u s  dollars in the french-speaking  caribbean islands  most notably haiti the symbol    usually written before the numerical amount  is used for the u s  dollar  as well as for many other currencies   the sign was the result of a late 18th-century  evolution of the scribal abbreviation  ps  for the peso  the common name for the spanish dollars that were in wide circulation in the new world from the 16th  to the 19th  centuries  these spanish pesos or dollars were minted in spanish america  namely in mexico city  potosí  bolivia  and lima  peru  the p and the s eventually came to be written over each other giving rise to popular explanation is that it is derived from the pillars of hercules on the spanish coat of arms of the spanish dollar  these pillars of hercules on the silver spanish dollar coins take the form of two vertical bars      and a swinging cloth band in the shape of an  s  yet another explanation suggests that the dollar sign was formed from the capital letters u and s written or printed one on top of the other  this theory  popularized by novelist ayn rand in atlas does not consider the fact that the symbol was already in use before the formation of the united american dollar coin was initially based on the value and look of the spanish dollar  used widely in spanish america from the 16th  to the 19th  centuries  the first dollar coins issued by the united states mint  founded 1792)  were similar in size and composition to the spanish dollar  minted in mexico and peru  the spanish  u s  silver dollars  and later  mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the united states  and the spanish dollar and mexican peso remained legal tender until the coinage act of 1857.  the coinage of various english colonies also circulated  the lion dollar was popular in the dutch new netherland colony  new york   but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the english colonies during the 17th  century and early 18th  century  examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable  thus they were sometimes referred to as  dog u s  dollar was first defined by the coinage act of 1792,  which specified a  dollar  to be based in the spanish milled dollar and of 371  grains and 4  sixteenths part of a grain of pure or 416  grains (27.0  g  of standard silver and an  eagle  to be 247  and 4  eighths of a grain or 270  grains (17  g  of gold  again depending on the choice of the value 371  grains arose from alexander hamilton s decision to base the new american unit on the average weight of a selection of worn spanish dollars  hamilton got the treasury to weigh a sample of spanish dollars and the average weight came out to be 371  grains  a new spanish dollar was usually about 377  grains in weight  and so the new u s  dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the spanish dollar the same coinage act also set the value of an eagle at 10  dollars  and the dollar at 1⁄10  eagle  it called for 90%  silver alloy coins in denominations of 1,  1⁄2,  1⁄4,  1⁄10,  and 1⁄20  dollars  it called for 90%  gold alloy coins in denominations of 1,  1⁄2,  1⁄4,  and 1⁄10  eagles  the value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods  this allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time  except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nation s early currency of the united states did not exhibit faces of presidents  as is the custom although today  by law  only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on united states in fact  the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency  a practice compared to the policies of european the currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th  century  before that  heads  side of coinage used profile faces and striding  seated  and standing figures from greek and roman mythology and composite native americans  the last coins to be converted to profiles of historic americans were the dime (1946)  and the dollar (1971).for  articles on the currencies of the colonies and states  see connecticut pound  delaware pound  georgia pound  maryland pound  massachusetts

thirteen colonies became independent states  freed from british monetary regulations  they each issued £sd paper money to pay for military expenses  the continental congress also began issuing  continental currency  denominated in spanish dollars  the dollar was valued relative to the states  currencies at the following rates continental currency depreciated badly during the war  giving rise to the famous phrase  not worth a a primary problem was that monetary policy was not coordinated between congress and the states  which continued to issue bills of credit  additionally  neither congress nor the governments of the several states had the will or the means to retire the bills from circulation through taxation or the sale of the currency was ultimately replaced by the silver dollar at the rate of 1  silver dollar to 1000  continental dollars from 1792,  when the mint act was passed  the dollar was defined as 371.25  grains (24.056  g  of silver  many erroneously assume gold was standardized at a fixed rate in parity with silver  however  there is no evidence of congress making this law  this has to do with alexander hamilton s suggestion to congress of a fixed 15:1  ratio of silver to gold  respectively  the gold coins that were minted however  were not given any denomination whatsoever and traded for a market value relative to the congressional standard of the silver dollar  1834  saw a shift in the gold standard to 23.2  grains (1.50  g   followed by a slight adjustment to 23.22  grains (1.505  g  in 1837  (16:1  needed in 1862,  paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals  due to the civil war  silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878  the link between paper money and coins was reinstated  this disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the war of 1812.  the use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the articles of confederation from 1777  to 1788.  with no solid backing and being easily counterfeited  the continentals quickly lost their value  giving rise to the phrase  not worth a continental   this was a primary reason for the  no state shall    make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts  clause in article 1,  section 10  of the united states constitution in order to finance the war of 1812,  congress authorized the issuance of treasury notes  interest-bearing  short-term  debt that could be used to pay public dues  while they were intended to serve as debt  they did function  to a limited extent  as money  treasury notes were again printed to help resolve the reduction in public revenues resulting from the panic of 1837  and the panic of 1857,  as well as to help finance the mexican–american war and the civil war in addition to treasury notes  in 1861,  congress authorized the treasury to borrow $50  million in the form of demand notes  which did not bear interest but could be redeemed on demand for precious metals  however  by december 1861,  the union government s supply of specie was outstripped by demand for redemption and they were forced to suspend redemption temporarily  the following february  congress passed the legal tender act of 1862,  issuing united states notes  which were not redeemable on demand and bore no interest  but were legal tender  meaning that creditors had to accept them at face value for any payment except for public debts and import tariffs  however  silver and gold coins continued to be issued  resulting in the depreciation of the newly printed notes through gresham s law  in 1869,  supreme court ruled in hepburn v  griswold that congress could not require creditors to accept united states notes  but overturned that ruling the next year in the legal tender cases  in 1875,  congress passed the specie payment resumption act  requiring the treasury to allow us notes to be redeemed for gold after january 1,  1879.  the treasury ceased to issue united states notes in 1971.the  gold standard act of 1900  abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as 23.22  grains (1.505  g  of gold  equivalent to setting the price of 1  troy ounce of gold at $20.67.  silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964,  when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters  and the half dollar was reduced to 40%  silver  silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970.  gold coins were confiscated by executive order 6102  issued in 1933  by franklin roosevelt  the gold standard was changed to 13.71  grains (0.888  g   equivalent to setting the price of 1  troy ounce of gold at $35.  this standard persisted until 1968.between  1968  and 1975,  a variety of pegs to gold were put in place  eventually culminating in a sudden end  on august 15,  1971,  to the convertibility of dollars to gold later dubbed the nixon shock  the last peg was $42.22  per needed  before the u s  dollar was let to freely float on currency markets according to the bureau of engraving and printing  the largest note it ever printed was the $100,000  gold certificate  series 1934.  these notes were printed from december 18,  1934,  through january 9,  1935,  and were issued by the treasurer of the united states to federal reserve banks only against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the treasury  these notes were used for transactions between federal reserve banks and were not circulated among the general public official united states coins have been produced every year from 1792  to the present discontinued coin denominations include collector coins for which everyday transactions are all these coins are still legal tender at face value  though some are far more valuable today for their numismatic value  and for gold and silver coins  their precious metal value  from 1965  to 1970  the kennedy half dollar was the only circulating coin with any silver content  which was removed in 1971  and replaced with cupronickel  however  since 1992,  the u s  mint has produced special silver proof sets in addition to the regular yearly proof sets with silver dimes  quarters  and half dollars in place of the standard copper-nickel  versions  in addition  an experimental $4.00   stella  coin was also minted in 1879,  but never placed into circulation  and is properly considered to be a pattern rather than an actual coin denomination the $50  coin mentioned was only produced in 1915  for the panama-pacific  international exposition (1915)  celebrating the opening of the panama canal  only 1,128  were made  645  of which were octagonal  this remains the only u s  coin that was not round as well as the largest and heaviest u s  coin ever produced a $100  gold coin was produced in high relief during 2015,  although it was primarily produced for collectors  not for general 1934  to present  the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny  nickel  dime  quarter  half dollar and dollar  the nickel is the only coin still in use today that is essentially unchanged  except in its design  from its original version  every year since 1866,  the nickel has been 75%  copper and 25%  nickel  except for 4  years during world war ii when nickel was needed for the war due to the penny s low value  some efforts have been made to eliminate the penny as circulating united states mint produces proof sets specifically for collectors and speculators  silver proofs tend to be the standard designs but with the dime  quarter  and half dollar containing 90%  silver  starting in 1983  and ending in 1997,  the mint also produced proof sets containing the year s commemorative coins alongside the regular coins  another type of proof set is the presidential dollar proof set where four special $1  coins are minted each year featuring a president  because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins  the production of new presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on december 13,  2011,  by u s  treasury secretary timothy f  geithner  future minting of such coins will be made solely for first united states dollar was minted in 1794.  known as the flowing hair dollar  contained 416  grains of  standard silver  (89.25%  silver and 10.75%  copper   as specified by section of the coinage act of 1792.  it was designated by section 9  of that act as having  the value of a spanish milled dollar  dollar coins have not been very popular in the united silver dollars were minted intermittently from 1794  through 1935;  a copper-nickel  dollar of the same large size  featuring president dwight d  eisenhower  was minted from 1971  through 1978.  gold dollars were also minted in the 19th  century  the susan b  anthony dollar coin was introduced in 1979;  these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters  due to their nearly equal size  their milled edge  and their similar color  minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980   collectors  pieces were struck in 1981),  but  as with all past u s  coins  they remain legal tender  as the number of anthony dollars held by the federal reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted  additional anthony dollars were struck in 1999.  in 2000,  a new $1  coin  featuring sacagawea   the sacagawea dollar  was introduced  which corrected some of the problems of the anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color  without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the anthony dollar  however  this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still-existing  $1  bill and is rarely used in daily transactions  the failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular february 2007,  the u s  mint  under the presidential $1  coin act of introduced a new $1  u s  presidential dollar coin  based on the success of the "50  state quarters  series  the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations  starting with george washington  on the obverse side  the reverse side features the statue of liberty  to allow for larger  more detailed portraits  the traditional inscriptions of  e pluribus unum    in god we trust   the year of minting or issuance  and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face  this feature  similar to the edge inscriptions seen on the british £1  coin  is not usually associated with u s  coin designs  the inscription  liberty  has been eliminated  with the statue of liberty serving as a sufficient replacement  in addition  due to the nature of u s  coins  this will be the first time there will be circulating u s  coins of different denominations with the same president featured on the obverse  heads  side  lincoln penny  jefferson nickel  franklin d  roosevelt dime  washington quarter  kennedy half dollar  and eisenhower dollar   another unusual fact about the new $1  coin is grover cleveland will have two coins with two different portraits issued due to the fact he was the only u s  president to be elected to two non-consecutive  releases of the washington coin included error coins shipped primarily from the philadelphia mint to florida and tennessee banks  highly sought after by collectors  and trading for as much as $850  each within a week of discovery  the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions  e pluribus unum in god we trust 2007  p   the mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly philadelphia  although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units  edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to  heads   some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying  upside down lettering error  some cynics also erroneously point out that the federal reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years  whereas coins are more permanent  the fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes  which have been withdrawn from circulation  bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones  as most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes  they commonly accept only $1  bills  though a few will give change in dollar coins the u s  constitution provides that congress shall have the power to  borrow money on the credit of the united congress has exercised that power by authorizing federal reserve banks to issue federal reserve notes  those notes are  obligations of the united states  and  shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the treasury department of the united states  in the city of washington  district of columbia  or at any federal reserve federal reserve notes are designated by law as  legal tender  for the payment of congress has also authorized the issuance of more than 10  other types of banknotes  including the united states and the federal reserve bank note  the federal reserve note is the only type that remains in circulation since the 1970s.currently  printed denominations are $1,  $2,  $5,  $10,  $20,  $50,  and $100.  notes above the $100  denomination stopped being printed in 1946  and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969.  these notes were used primarily in inter-bank  transactions or by organized crime  it was the latter usage that prompted president richard nixon to issue an executive order in 1969  halting their use  with the advent of electronic banking  they became less necessary  notes in denominations of $500,  $1,000,  $5,000,  $10,000,  and $100,000  were all produced at one time  see large denomination bills in u s  currency for details  with the exception of the $100,000  bill  which was only issued as a series 1934  gold certificate and was never publicly circulated  thus it is illegal to own   these notes are now collectors  items and are worth more than their face value to collectors though still predominantly green  post-2004  series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations  as a result of a 2008  decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the american council of the blind  the bureau of engraving and printing is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note  except the $1  and the current version of the $100  bill  it also plans larger  higher-contrast  numerals  more color differences  and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired during the transition monetary base consists of coins and federal reserve notes in circulation outside the federal reserve banks and the u s  treasury  plus deposits held by depository institutions at federal reserve banks  the adjusted monetary base has increased from approximately 400  billion dollars in 1994,  to 800  billion in 2005,  and over 3000  billion in the amount of cash in circulation is increased  or decreased  by the actions of the federal reserve system  eight times a year  the 12-person  federal open market committee meets to determine u s  monetary every business day  the federal reserve system engages in open market operations to carry out that monetary if the federal reserve desires to increase the money supply  it will buy securities  such as u s  treasury bonds  anonymously from banks in exchange for dollars  conversely  it will sell securities to the banks in exchange for dollars  to take dollars out of the federal reserve makes a purchase  it credits the seller s reserve account  with the federal reserve   this money is not transferred from any existing funds—it is at this point that the federal reserve has created new high-powered  money  commercial banks can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve account at the federal reserve  to fulfill those requests  the federal reserve places an order for printed money from the u s  treasury the treasury department in turn sends these requests to the bureau of engraving and printing  to print new dollar bills  and the bureau of the mint  to stamp the coins  usually  the short-term  goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short-term  interest rate target  in other instances  monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold  for example  in the case of the united states the federal reserve targets the federal funds rate  the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight  the other primary means of conducting monetary policy include   i

power to  coin money  and to  regulate the value  of domestic and foreign coins  congress exercised those powers when it enacted the coinage act of 1792.  that act provided for the minting of the

right the value of the u s  dollar declined significantly during wartime  especially during the american civil war  world war i  and world war the federal reserve  which was established in 1913,  was designed to furnish an  elastic  currency subject to  substantial changes of quantity over short periods   which differed significantly from previous forms of high-powered  money such as gold  national bank notes  and silver over the very long run  the prior gold standard kept prices stable—for instance  the price level and the value of the u s  dollar in 1914  was not very different from the price level in the 1880s.  the federal reserve initially succeeded in maintaining the value of the u s  dollar and price stability  reversing the inflation caused by the first world war and stabilizing the value of the dollar during the 1920s,  before presiding over a 30%  deflation in u s  prices in the the bretton woods system established after world war ii  the value of gold was fixed to $35  per ounce  and the value of the u s  dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold  rising government spending in the 1960s,  however  led to doubts about the ability of the united states to maintain this convertibility  gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold  and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline  facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the united states would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold  gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971  by president nixon  resulting in the  nixon value of the u s  dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold  and it fell upon the federal reserve to maintain the value of the u s  currency  the federal reserve  however  continued to increase the money supply  resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the u s  dollar in the 1970s.  this was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked  the phillips curve   and so inflation was regarded as relatively between 1965  and 1981,  the u s  dollar lost two thirds of its 1979,  president carter appointed paul volcker chairman of the federal reserve  the federal reserve tightened the money supply and inflation was substantially lower in the 1980s,  and hence the value of the u s  dollar the thirty-year  period from 1981  to 2009,  the u s  dollar lost over half its this is because the federal reserve has targeted not zero inflation  but a low  stable rate of inflation—between 1987  and 1997,  the rate of inflation was approximately 3.5%,  and between 1997  and 2007  it was approximately 2%.  the so-called   great moderation  of economic conditions since the 1970s  is credited to monetary policy targeting price is ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero inflation  which would mean a constant value for the u s  dollar over time  or low  stable inflation  which would mean a continuously but slowly declining value of the dollar over time  as is the case now   although some economists are in favor of a zero inflation policy and therefore a constant value for the u s  others contend that such a policy limits the ability of the central bank to control interest rates and stimulate the economy when 1.  mexican peso values prior to 1993  revaluation 2.  value
