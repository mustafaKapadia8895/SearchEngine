 the north sea is a marginal sea of the atlantic ocean located between great britain  scandinavia  germany  the netherlands  belgium  and france  an epeiric  or  shelf   sea on the european continental shelf  it connects to the ocean through the english channel in the south and the norwegian sea in the north  it is more than 970  kilometres (600  mi  long and 580  kilometres (360  mi  wide  with an area of around 570,000  square kilometres (220,000  sq mi  the north sea has long been the site of important european shipping lanes as well as a major fishery  the sea is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in bordering countries and more recently has developed into a rich source of energy resources including fossil fuels  wind  and early efforts in wave power historically  the north sea has featured prominently in geopolitical and military affairs  particularly in northern europe  it was also important globally through the power northern europeans projected worldwide during much of the middle ages and into the modern era  the north sea was the centre of the vikings  rise  subsequently  the hanseatic league  the netherlands  and the british each sought to dominate the north sea and thus the access to the markets and resources of the world  as germany s only outlet to the ocean  the north sea continued to be strategically important through both world wars the coast of the north sea presents a diversity of geological and geographical features  in the north  deep fjords and sheer cliffs mark the norwegian and scottish coastlines  whereas in the south the coast consists primarily of sandy beaches and wide mudflats  due to the dense population  heavy industrialization  and intense use of the sea and area surrounding it  there have been a number of environmental issues affecting the sea s ecosystems  adverse environmental issues — commonly including overfishing  industrial and agricultural runoff  dredging  and dumping among others — have led to a number of efforts to prevent degradation of the sea while still making use of its economic potential the north sea is bounded by the orkney islands and east coast of great britain to the and the northern and central european mainland to the east and south  including norway  denmark  germany  the netherlands  belgium  and in the southwest  beyond the straits of dover  the north sea becomes the english channel connecting to the atlantic in the east  it connects to the baltic sea via the skagerrak and narrow straits that separate denmark from norway and sweden in the north it is bordered by the shetland islands  and connects with the norwegian sea  which lies in the very north-eastern  part of the north sea is more than 970  kilometres (600  mi  long and 580  kilometres (360

temperatures in january range on average between 0  to 4  °c (32  to 39  °f  and in july between 13  to 18  °c (55  to 64  °f   the winter months see frequent gales and salinity averages between 34  to 35  grams of salt per litre of the salinity has the highest variability where there is fresh water inflow  such as at the rhine and elbe estuaries  the baltic sea exit and along the coast of main pattern to the flow of water in the north sea is an anti-clockwise  rotation along the north sea is an arm of the atlantic ocean receiving the majority of ocean current from the northwest opening  and a lesser portion of warm current from the smaller opening at the english channel  these tidal currents leave along the norwegian surface and deep water currents may move in different directions  low salinity surface coastal waters move offshore  and deeper  denser high salinity waters move in north sea located on the continental shelf has different waves from those in deep ocean water  the wave speeds are diminished and the wave amplitudes are increased  in the north sea there are two amphidromic systems and a third incomplete amphidromic in the north sea the average tide difference in wave amplitude is between 0  to 8  metres (0  to 26  kelvin tide of the atlantic ocean is a semidiurnal wave that travels northward  some of the energy from this wave travels through the english channel into the north sea  the wave still travels northward in the atlantic ocean  and once past the northern tip of great britain  the kelvin wave turns east and south and once again enters into the north eastern and western coasts of the north sea are jagged  formed by glaciers during the ice ages  the coastlines along the southernmost part are covered with the remains of deposited glacial the norwegian mountains plunge into the sea creating deep fjords and archipelagos  south of stavanger  the coast softens  the islands become the eastern scottish coast is similar  though less severe than norway  from north east of england  the cliffs become lower and are composed of less resistant moraine  which erodes more easily  so that the coasts have more rounded in the netherlands  belgium and in east anglia the littoral is low and the east coast and south-east  of the north sea  wadden sea  have coastlines that are mainly sandy and straight owing to longshore drift  particularly along belgium and southern coastal areas were originally amphibious flood plains and swampy land  in areas especially vulnerable to storm surges  people settled behind elevated levees and on natural areas of high ground such as spits and as early as 500  bc  people were constructing artificial dwelling hills higher than the prevailing flood it was only around the beginning of the high middle ages  in 1200  ad  that inhabitants began to connect single ring dikes into a dike line along the entire coast  thereby turning amphibious regions between the land and the sea into permanent solid modern form of the dikes supplemented by overflow and lateral diversion channels  began to appear in the 17th  and 18th  centuries  built in the the north sea floods of 1953  and 1962  were impetus for further raising of the dikes as well as the shortening of the coast line so as to present as little surface area as possible to the punishment of the sea and the currently  27%  of the netherlands is below sea level protected by dikes  dunes  and beach management today consists of several the dike slope reduces the energy of the incoming sea  so that the dike itself does not receive the full dikes that lie directly on the sea are especially the dikes have  over the years  been repeatedly raised  sometimes up to 9  metres (30  ft  and have been made flatter to better reduce wave where the dunes are sufficient to protect the land behind them from the sea  these dunes are planted with beach grass  ammophila arenaria  to protect them from erosion by wind  water  and foot surges threaten  in particular  the coasts of the netherlands  belgium  germany  and denmark and low lying areas of eastern england particularly around the wash and storm surges are caused by changes in barometric pressure combined with strong wind created wave first recorded storm tide flood was the julianenflut  on 17  february 1164.  in its wake the jadebusen   a bay on the coast of germany   began to form  a storm tide in 1228  is recorded to have killed more than 100,000  in 1362,  the second marcellus flood  also known as the grote manndrenke  hit the entire southern coast of the north sea  chronicles of the time again record more than 100,000  deaths as large parts of the coast were lost permanently to the sea  including the now legendary lost city of in the 20th  century  the north sea flood of 1953  flooded several nations  coasts and cost more than 2,000  315  citizens of hamburg died in the north sea flood of rare  the north sea has been the site of a number of historically documented tsunamis  the storegga slides were a series of underwater landslides  in which a piece of the norwegian continental shelf slid into the norwegian sea  the immense landslips occurred between 8150  bce and 6000  bce  and caused a tsunami up to 20  metres (66  ft  high that swept through the north sea  having the greatest effect on scotland and the faeroe the dover straits earthquake of 1580  is among the first recorded earthquakes in the north sea measuring between 5.6  and 5.9  on the richter scale  this event caused extensive damage in calais both through its tremors and possibly triggered a tsunami  though this has never been confirmed  the theory is a vast underwater landslide in the english channel was triggered by the earthquake  which in turn caused a the tsunami triggered by the 1755  lisbon earthquake reached holland  although the waves had lost their destructive power  the largest earthquake ever recorded in the united kingdom was the 1931  dogger bank earthquake  which measured 6.1  on the richter magnitude scale and caused a small tsunami that flooded parts of the british epicontinental seas like the current north sea have since long existed on the european continental shelf  the rifting that formed the northern part of the atlantic ocean during the jurassic and cretaceous periods  from about 150  million years ago  caused tectonic uplift in the british since then  a shallow sea has almost continuously existed between the uplands of the fennoscandian shield and the british this precursor of the current north sea has grown and shrunk with the rise and fall of the eustatic sea level during geologic time  sometimes it was connected with other shallow seas  such as the sea above the paris basin to the south-west,  the paratethys sea to the south-east,  or the tethys ocean to the the late cretaceous  about 85  million years ago  all of modern mainland europe except for scandinavia was a scattering of by the early oligocene  34  to 28  million years ago  the emergence of western and central europe had almost completely separated the north sea from the tethys ocean  which gradually shrank to become the mediterranean as southern europe and south west asia became dry the north sea was cut off from the english channel by a narrow land bridge until that was breached by at least two catastrophic floods between 450,000  and 180,000  years since the start of the quaternary period about 2.6  million years ago  the eustatic sea level has fallen during each glacial period and then risen again  every time the ice sheet reached its greatest extent  the north sea became almost completely dry  the present-day  coastline formed after the last glacial maximum when the sea began to flood the european continental 2006  a bone fragment was found while drilling for oil in the north sea  analysis indicated that it was a plateosaurus from 199  to 216  million years ago  this was the deepest dinosaur fossil ever found and the first find for and other zooplankton are plentiful in the north sea  these tiny organisms are crucial elements of the food chain supporting many species of over 230  species of fish live in the north sea  cod  haddock  whiting  saithe  plaice  sole  mackerel  herring  pouting  sprat  and sandeel are all very common and are fished due to the various depths of the north sea trenches and differences in salinity  temperature  and water movement  some fish such as blue-mouth  redfish and rabbitfish reside only in small areas of the north are also commonly found throughout the sea  norway lobster  deep-water  prawns  and brown shrimp are all commercially fished  but other species of lobster  shrimp  oyster  mussels and clams all live in the north recently non-indigenous  species have become established including the pacific oyster and atlantic jackknife coasts of the north sea are home to nature reserves including the ythan estuary  fowlsheugh nature preserve  and farne islands in the uk and the wadden sea national parks in denmark  germany and the these locations provide breeding habitat for dozens of bird species  tens of millions of birds make use of the north sea for breeding  feeding  or migratory stopovers every year  populations of black legged kittiwakes  atlantic puffins  northern fulmars  and species of petrels  gannets  seaducks  loons  divers   cormorants  gulls  auks  and

clogging harbours and inlets and has become a to the heavy human populations and high level of industrialization along its shores  the wildlife of the north sea has suffered from pollution  overhunting  and overfishing  flamingos and pelicans were once found along the southern shores of the north sea  but became extinct over the 2nd  walruses frequented the orkney islands through the mid-16th  century  as both sable island and orkney islands lay within its normal gray whales also resided in the north sea but were driven to extinction in the atlantic in the 17th  other species have dramatically declined in population  though they are still found  north atlantic right whales  sturgeon  shad  rays  skates  salmon  and other species were common in the north sea until the 20th  century  when numbers declined due to other factors like the introduction of non-indigenous  species  industrial and agricultural pollution  trawling and dredging  human-induced  eutrophication  construction on coastal breeding and feeding grounds  sand and gravel extraction  offshore construction  and heavy shipping traffic have also contributed to the ospar commission manages the ospar

flemish  basque and norwegian whalers who were replaced in the 16th  century by dutch  english  danes and germans  took massive numbers of whales and dolphins and nearly depleted the right whales  this activity likely led to the extinction of the atlantic population of the once common gray by 1902  the whaling had after being absent for 300  years a single gray whale it probably was the first of many more to find its way through the now ice-free  northwest passage  once 16-metre  (50  ft   fish  were taken in large quantities at the mouth of the river perhaps the gray whale will someday return to its former seine estuary breeding grounds and to the feeding grounds of the wadden where it will again roil the sediments and release its benthic nutrients that will benefit the ecosystem through history various names have been used for the north sea  one of the earliest recorded names was septentrionalis oceanus  or  northern ocean   which was cited by the name  north sea  probably came into english  however  via the dutch  noordzee   who named it thus either in contrast with the zuiderzee   south sea    located south of frisia  or because the sea is generally to the north of the netherlands  before the adoption of  north sea   the names used in english were  german sea  or  german ocean   referred to the latin names  mare gemanicum  and  oceanus and these persisted in use until the first world common names in use for long periods were the latin terms  mare as well as their english equivalents   frisian modern names of the sea in local languages are  danish  nordsøen

commerce and conquest  many areas have access to the north sea because of its long coastline and the european rivers that empty into the british isles had been protected from invasion by the north sea until the roman conquest of britain in 43  ce  the romans established organised ports  which increased shipping  and began sustained when the romans abandoned britain in 410,  the germanic angles  saxons  and jutes began the next great migration across the north sea during the migration period  they made successive invasions of the viking age began in 793  with the attack on lindisfarne  for the next quarter-millennium  the vikings ruled the north sea  in their superior longships  they raided  traded  and established colonies and outposts along the coasts of the sea  from the middle ages through the 15th  century  the northern european coastal ports exported domestic goods  dyes  linen  salt  metal goods and wine  the scandinavian and baltic areas shipped grain  fish  naval necessities  and timber  in turn the north sea countries imported high-grade  cloths  spices  and fruits from the mediterranean commerce during this era was mainly conducted by maritime trade due to underdeveloped the 13th  century the hanseatic league  though centred on the baltic sea  started to control most of the trade through important members and outposts on the north the league lost its dominance in the 16th  century  as neighbouring states took control of former hanseatic cities and outposts  their internal conflict prevented effective cooperation and as the league lost control of its maritime cities  new trade routes emerged that provided europe with asian  american  and african 17th  century dutch golden age during which dutch herring  cod and whale fisheries reached an all

1904  by the dogger bank incident  during the russo-japanese  war  several ships of the russian baltic fleet  which was on its way to the far east  mistook british fishing boats for japanese ships and fired on them  and then upon each other  near the dogger bank  nearly causing britain to enter the war on the side of japan during the first world war  great britain s grand fleet and germany s kaiserliche marine faced each other in the north which became the main theatre of the war for surface britain s larger fleet and north sea mine barrage were able to establish an effective blockade for most of the war  which restricted the central powers  access to many crucial major battles included the battle of heligoland the battle of the dogger and the battle of world war i also brought the first extensive use of submarine warfare  and a number of submarine actions occurred in the north second world war also saw action in the north though it was restricted more to aircraft reconnaissance  and action by fighter bomber aircraft  submarines  and smaller vessels such as minesweepers and torpedo the aftermath of the war  hundreds of thousands of tons of chemical weapons were disposed of by being dumped in the north the war  the north sea lost much of its military significance because it is bordered only by nato member-states.  however  it gained significant economic importance in the 1960s  as the states around the north sea began full-scale  exploitation of its oil and gas the north sea continues to be an active trade that border the north sea all claim the 12  nautical miles (22

the 1973  oil crisis  and the climb of international oil prices made the large investments needed for extraction much more the production costs are relatively high  the quality of the oil  the political stability of the region  and the proximity of important markets in western europe has made the north sea an important oil producing the largest single humanitarian catastrophe in the north
