the sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity  which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing  unmonitored uncontrolled unrestricted access  or threat from local administrative negligence  sites are demarcated by unesco as protected the list is maintained by the international world heritage program administered by the unesco world heritage committee  composed of 21  unesco member states which are elected by the un general program catalogues  names  and conserves sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common culture and heritage of humanity  under certain conditions  listed sites can obtain funds from the world heritage fund  the program began with the convention concerning the protection of the world s cultural and natural which was adopted by the general conference of unesco on 16  november 1972.  since then  193  state parties have ratified the convention  making it one of the most widely recognized international agreements and the world s most popular cultural program as of july 2017,  1073  sites are listed  832  cultural  206  natural  and 35  mixed properties  in 167  the table of world heritage sites by country  lists italy as the home for the largest number of sites with 53,  followed by china (52),  spain (46),  france (43),  germany (42),  india (36),  mexico (34)  and united kingdom and british overseas territories (31)   in 1954,  the government of egypt decided to build the new aswan high dam  whose resulting future reservoir would eventually inundate a large stretch of the nile valley containing cultural treasures of ancient egypt and ancient nubia  in 1959,  the governments of egypt and sudan requested unesco to assist their countries to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites  in 1960,  the director-general  of unesco launched an appeal to the member states for an international campaign to save the monuments of this appeal resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds of sites  the recovery of thousands of objects  as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of a number of important temples  the most famous of which are the temple complexes of abu simbel and philae  the campaign  which ended in 1980,  was considered a success  as tokens of its gratitude to countries which especially contributed to the campaign s success  egypt donated four temples  the temple of dendur was moved to the metropolitan museum of art in new york city  the temple of debod was moved to the parque del oeste in madrid  the temple of taffeh was moved to the rijksmuseum van oudheden in the netherlands  and the temple of ellesyia to museo egizio in project cost $80  million  about $40  million of which was collected from 50  needed    the project s success led to other safeguarding campaigns  saving venice and its lagoon in italy  the ruins of mohenjo-daro  in pakistan  and the borobodur temple compounds in indonesia  unesco then initiated  with the international council on monuments and sites  a draft convention to protect the common cultural heritage of needed the united states initiated the idea of cultural conservation with nature conservation  the white house conference in 1965  called for a  world heritage trust  to preserve  the world s superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry   the international union for conservation of nature developed similar proposals in 1968,  and they were presented in 1972  to the united nations conference on the human environment in stockholm  under the world heritage committee  signatory countries are required to produce and submit periodic data reporting providing the world heritage committee with an overview of each participating nation s implementation of the world heritage convention and a  snapshot  of current conditions at world heritage properties a single text was agreed on by all parties  and the  convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage  was adopted by the general conference of unesco on 16  november 1972.the  convention came into force on 17  december 1975.  as of may 2017,  it has been ratified by 193  states parties  including 189  un member states plus the cook islands  the holy see  niue  and the palestinian territories  only four un member states have not ratified the convention  liechtenstein  nauru  somalia and tuvalu  country must first list its significant cultural and natural sites  the result is called the tentative list  a country may not nominate sites that have not been first included on the tentative list  next  it can place sites selected from that list into a nomination file the nomination file is evaluated by the international council on monuments and sites and the world conservation union  these bodies then make their recommendations to the world heritage committee  the committee meets once per year to determine whether or not to inscribe each nominated property on the world heritage list and sometimes defers or refers the decision to request more information from the country which nominated the site  there are ten selection criteria – a site must meet at least one of them to be included on the to 2004,  there were six criteria for cultural heritage and four criteria for natural heritage  in 2005,  this was modified so that there is now only one set of ten criteria  nominated sites must be of  outstanding universal value  and meet at least one of the ten these criteria have been modified or amended several times since their creation unesco designation as a world heritage site provides prima facie evidence that such culturally sensitive sites are legally protected pursuant to the law of war  under the geneva convention  its articles  protocols and customs  together with other treaties including the hague convention for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict and international law thus  the geneva convention treaty promulgates  article 53.  protection of cultural objects and of places of worship  without prejudice to the provisions of the hague convention for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict of 14  may 1954,'  and of other relevant international instruments  it is country may request to extend or reduce the boundaries  modify the official name  or change the selection criteria of one of its already listed sites  any proposal for a significant boundary change or modify the site s selection criteria must be submitted as if it were a new nomination  including first placing it on the tentative list and then onto the nomination request for a minor boundary change  one that does not have a significantly impact on the extent of the property or affect its  outstanding universal value   is also evaluated by the advisory bodies before being sent to the committee  such proposals can be rejected by either the advisory bodies or the committee if they judge it to be a significant change instead of a minor to change the site s official name is sent directly to the site may be added to the list of world heritage in danger if there are conditions that threaten the characteristics for which the landmark or area was inscribed on the world heritage list  such problems may involve armed conflict and war  natural disasters  pollution  poaching  or uncontrolled urbanization or human development  this danger list is intended to increase international awareness of the threats and to encourage counteractive measures  threats to a site can be either proven imminent threats or potential dangers that could have adverse effects on a state of conservation for each site on the danger list is reviewed on a yearly basis  after which the committee may request additional measures  delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the list of world heritage in danger and the world heritage two sites have ever been delisted  the arabian oryx sanctuary in oman and the dresden elbe valley in germany  the arabian oryx sanctuary was directly delisted in 2007,  instead of first being put on the danger list  after the omani government decided to reduce the protected area s size by 90  the dresden elbe valley was first placed on the danger list in 2006  when the world heritage committee decided that plans to construct the waldschlösschen bridge would significantly alter the valley s landscape  in response  the dresden city council attempted to stop the bridge s construction  but after several court decisions allowed the building of the bridge to proceed  the valley was removed from the world heritage list in are 1073  world heritage sites located in 167  states  of these  832  are cultural  206  are natural and 35  are mixed properties  the world heritage committee has divided the world into five geographic zones which it calls regions  africa  arab states  asia and the pacific  europe and north america  and latin america and the caribbean russia and the caucasus states are classified as european  while mexico and the caribbean are classified as belonging to the latin america   caribbean zone  despite their location in north america  the unesco geographic zones also give greater emphasis on administrative  rather than geographic associations  hence  gough island  located in the south atlantic  is part of the europe   north america region because the government of the united kingdom nominated the site the table below includes a breakdown of the sites according to these zones and their properties  uvs nuur basin  and  landscapes of dauria   mongolia  russian federation  are trans-regional  properties located in europe and asia and the pacific region  they are counted here in the asia and the pacific region  the property  the architectural work of le corbusier  an outstanding contribution to the modern movement   argentina  belgium  france  germany  india  japan  switzerland  is a trans-regional  property located in europe  asia and the pacific and latin america and the caribbean region  it is counted here in the europe and north america countries with ten or more world heritage sites  as of july 2017.despite  the successes of world heritage listing in promoting conservation  the unesco administered project has attracted criticism for under-representation  of heritage sites outside europe  disputed decisions on site selection and adverse impact of mass tourism on sites unable to manage rapid growth in visitor sizable lobbying industry has grown around the awards because world heritage listing has the potential to significantly increase tourism revenue from sites selected  site listing bids are often lengthy and costly  putting poorer countries at a disadvantage  eritrea s efforts to promote asmara are one 2016,  the australian government was reported to have successfully lobbied for great barrier reef conservation efforts to be removed from a unesco report titled  world heritage and tourism in a changing climate   the australian government s actions were in response to their concern about the negative impact that an  at risk  label could have on tourism revenue at a previously designated unesco world heritage number of listed world heritage locations such as george town  penang and casco viejo  panama have struggled to strike the balance between the economic benefits of catering to greatly increased visitor numbers and preserving the original culture and local communities that drew the
