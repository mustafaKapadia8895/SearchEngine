 el niño  ɛl ˈniːnjoʊ   spanish pronunciation  ˈniɲo   is the warm phase of the el niño southern oscillation  commonly called enso  and is associated with a band of warm ocean water that develops in the central and east-central  equatorial pacific  between approximately the international date line and 120°w),  including off the pacific coast of south america  el niño southern oscillation refers to the cycle of warm and cold temperatures  as measured by sea surface temperature  sst  of the tropical central and eastern pacific ocean  el niño is accompanied by high air pressure in the western pacific and low air pressure in the eastern pacific  the cool phase of enso is called  la niña  with sst in the eastern pacific below average and air pressures high in the eastern and low in western pacific  the enso cycle  both el niño and la niña  cause global changes of both temperatures and countries that are dependent upon agriculture and fishing  particularly those bordering the pacific ocean  are usually most affected  in american spanish  the capitalized term  el niño  refers to  the little boy   so named because the pool of warm water in the pacific near south america is often at its warmest around the original name   el niño de navidad   traces its origin centuries back to peruvian fishermen  who named the weather phenomenon in reference to the newborn  la niña   chosen as the  opposite  of el niño  literally translates to  the little girl  originally the term el niño applied to an annual weak warm ocean current that ran southwards along the coast of peru and ecuador at about christmas however  over time the term has evolved and now refers to the warm and negative phase of the el niño southern oscillation and is the warming of the ocean surface or above-average  sea surface temperatures in either the central and eastern tropical pacific this warming causes a shift in the atmospheric circulation with rainfall becoming reduced over indonesia and australia  while rainfall and tropical cyclone formation increases over the tropical pacific the low-level  surface trade winds  which normally blow from east to west along the equator  either weaken or start blowing from the other el niño events are thought to have been occurring for thousands of for example  it is thought that el niño affected the inca empire in modern-day  peru  who sacrificed humans in order to try to prevent the scientists have also found the chemical signatures of warmer sea surface temperatures and increased rainfall caused by el niño in coral specimens that are around 13,000  years in around 1525  when francisco pizarro made landfall on peru  he noted rainfall occurring in the deserts which subsequently became the first written record of the impacts of el modern day research and reanalysis techniques have managed to find at least 26  el niño events since 1900,  with the 1982-83,  1997–98  and 2014–16  events among the strongest on each country has a different threshold for what constitutes an el niño event  which is tailored to their specific for example  the australian bureau of meteorology looks at the trade winds  soi  weather models and sea surface temperatures in

meteorological agency declares that an el niño event has started when the average 5  month sea surface temperature deviation for the nino.3  region  is over 0.5  °c (0.90  °f  warmer for 6  consecutive months or the peruvian government declares that a coastal el nino is under way  if the sea surface temperatures in the nino 1  and 2  regions  equal or exceed +0.4  °c for at least 3  months there is no consensus on if climate change will have any influence on the occurrence  strength or duration of el niño events  as research supports el niño events becoming stronger  longer

modern-day  peru  who sacrificed humans in order to try and prevent the is thought that there have been at least 30  el niño events since 1900,  with the 1982-83,  1997–98  and 2014–16  events among the strongest on since 2000,  el niño events have been observed in 2002–03,  2004–05,  2006–07,  2009–10  and enso events were recorded in the years 1790–93,  1828,  1876–78,  1891,  1925–26,  1972–73,  1982–83,  1997–98,  and update typically  this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of two to seven years  and lasts nine months to two the average period length is five years  when this warming occurs for seven to nine months  it is classified as el niño  conditions   when its duration is longer  it is classified as an el niño is no consensus on whether climate change will have any influence on the occurrence  strength or duration of el niño events  as research supports el niño events becoming stronger  longer  shorter and strong el niño episodes  a secondary peak in sea surface

suggests a strong el-niño  effect between 1789  and 1793  caused poor crop yields in europe  which in turn helped touch off the french the extreme weather produced by el niño in 1876–77  gave rise to the most deadly famines of the 19th  the 1876  famine alone in northern china killed up to 13  million early recorded mention of the term  el niño  to refer to climate occurred in 1892,  when captain camilo carrillo told the geographical society congress in lima that peruvian sailors named the warm north-flowing  current  el niño  because it was most noticeable around the phenomenon had long been of interest because of its effects on the guano industry and other enterprises that depend on biological productivity of the sea charles todd  in 1888,  suggested droughts in india and australia tended to occur at the same norman lockyer noted the same in an el niño connection with flooding was reported in 1894  by víctor eguiguren  es  (1852–1919)  and in 1895  by federico alfonso pezet in 1924,  gilbert walker  for whom the walker circulation is named  coined the term  southern he and others  including norwegian-american  meteorologist jacob bjerknes  are generally credited with identifying the el niño major 1982–83  el niño led to an upsurge of interest from the scientific community  the period 1991–1995  was unusual in that el niños have rarely occurred in such rapid an especially intense el niño event in 1998  caused an estimated 16%  of the world s reef systems to die  the event temporarily warmed air temperature by 1.5  °c  compared to the usual increase of 0.25  °c associated with el niño since then  mass coral bleaching has become common worldwide  with all regions having suffered  severe is thought that there are several different types of el niño events  with the canonical eastern pacific and the modoki central pacific types being the two that receive the most these different types of el niño events are classified by where the tropical pacific sea surface temperature  sst  anomalies are the for example  the strongest sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the canonical eastern pacific event are located off the coast of south the strongest anomalies associated with the modoki central pacific event are located near the international however  during the duration of a single event  the area with the greatest sea surface

observed  in which the usual place of the temperature anomaly  niño 1  and 2)  is not affected  but an anomaly arises in the central pacific  niño the phenomenon is called central pacific  cp  el  dateline  el niño  because the anomaly arises near the dateline   or el niño  modoki   modoki is japanese for  similar  but effects of the cp el niño are different from those of the traditional ep el niño—e g   the recently discovered el niño leads to more hurricanes more frequently making landfall in the is also a scientific debate on the very existence of this  new  enso  indeed  a number of studies dispute the reality of this statistical distinction or its increasing occurrence  or both  either arguing the reliable record is too short to detect such a finding no distinction or trend using other statistical or that other types should be distinguished  such as standard and extreme first recorded el niño that originated in the central pacific and moved toward the east was in recent central pacific el niños happened in 1986–87,  1991–92,  1994–95,  2002–03,  2004–05  and furthermore  there were  modoki  events in 1963–64,  1965–66,  1968–70,  1977–78  and nino affects the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns  which as a result can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator  then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the areas west of japan and korea tend to experience much fewer september–november tropical cyclone impacts during el niño and neutral years  during el niño years  the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130°e,  which would favor the japanese the atlantic ocean vertical wind shear is increased  which inhibits tropical cyclone genesis and intensification  by causing the westerly winds in the atmosphere to be the atmosphere over the atlantic ocean can also be drier and more stable during el niño events  which can also inhibit tropical cyclone genesis and within the eastern pacific basin  el niño events contribute to decreased easterly vertical wind shear and favours above-normal  hurricane however  the impacts of the enso state in this region can vary and are strongly influenced by background climate the western pacific basin experiences a change in the location of where tropical cyclones form during el niño events  without a major change in how many develop each as a result of this change micronesia is more likely to be affected by several tropical cyclones  while china has a decreased risk of being affected by several tropical needed  a change in the location of where tropical cyclones form also occurs within the southern pacific ocean between 135°e  and 120°w,  with tropical cyclones more likely to occur within the southern pacific basin than the australian as a result of this change tropical cyclones are 50%  less likely to make landfall on queensland  while the risk of a tropical cyclone is elevated for island nations like niue  french polynesia  tonga  tuvalu and the cook study of climate records has shown that el niño events in the equatorial pacific are generally associated with a warm tropical north atlantic in the following spring and about half of el niño events persist sufficiently into the spring months for the western hemisphere warm pool to become unusually large in occasionally  el niño s effect on the atlantic walker circulation over south america strengthens the easterly trade winds in the western equatorial atlantic region  as a result  an unusual cooling may occur in the eastern equatorial atlantic in spring and summer following el niño peaks in cases of el niño-type  events in both oceans simultaneously have been linked to severe famines related to the extended failure of monsoon enso linkages exist in the high southern latitudes around specifically  el niño conditions result in high-pressure  anomalies over the amundsen and bellingshausen seas  causing reduced sea ice and increased poleward heat fluxes in these sectors  as well as the ross sea  the weddell sea  conversely  tends to become colder with more sea ice during el niño  the exact opposite heating and atmospheric pressure anomalies occur during la this pattern of variability is known as the antarctic dipole mode  although the antarctic response to enso forcing is not of el niño events since 1950,  show that impacts associated with el niño events depend on what season it however  while certain events and impacts are expected to occur during events  it is not certain or guaranteed that they will the impacts that generally do occur during most el niño events include below-average  rainfall over indonesia and northern south america  while above average rainfall occurs in southeastern south america  eastern equatorial africa  and the southern united el niño events  the shift in rainfall away from the western pacific may mean that rainfall across australia is over the southern part of the continent  warmer than average temperatures can be recorded as weather systems are more mobile and fewer blocking areas of high pressure the onset of the indo-australian  monsoon in tropical australia is delayed by two to six weeks  which as a consequence means that rainfall is reduced over the northern the risk of a significant bushfire season in south-eastern  australia is higher following an el niño event  especially when it is combined with a positive indian ocean dipole during an el niño event  new zealand tends to experience stronger or more frequent westerly winds during their summer  which leads to an elevated risk of drier than normal conditions along the east there is more rain than usual though on new zealand s west coast  because of the barrier effect of the north island mountain ranges and the southern generally experiences drier than normal conditions during an el niño  which can lead to drought becoming established over the however  the main impacts on the island nation is felt about a year after the event becomes within the samoan islands  below average rainfall and higher than normal temperatures are recorded during el niño events  which can lead to droughts and forest fires on the other impacts include a decrease in the sea level  possibility of coral bleaching in the marine environment and an increased risk of a tropical cyclone affecting africa  east africa — including kenya  tanzania  and the white nile basin — experiences  in the long rains from march to may  wetter-than-normal  conditions  conditions are also drier than normal from december to february in south-central  africa  mainly in zambia  zimbabwe  mozambique  and botswana as warm water spreads from the west pacific and the indian ocean to the east pacific  it takes the rain with it  causing extensive drought in the western pacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern pacific  singapore experienced the driest february in 2014  since records began in 1869,  with only 6.3  mm of rain falling in the month and temperatures hitting as high as 35  °c on 26  february  the years 1968  and 2005  had the next driest februaries  when 8.4  mm of rain fell  niño s effects on europe are controversial  complex and difficult to analyse  as it is one of several factors that influence the weather over the continent and other factors can overwhelm the north america  the main temperature and precipitation impacts of el niño  generally occur in the six months between october and in particular the majority of canada generally has a milder than normal winters and cold fronts springs  with the exception of eastern canada where no significant impacts within the united states  the impacts generally observed during the six-month  period include  wetter-than-average  conditions along the gulf coast between texas and florida  while drier conditions are observed in hawaii  the ohio valley  pacific northwest and the rocky over california and the south-western  united states  there is a weak relationship between el nino and above-average  precipitation  as it strongly depends on the strength of the el niño event amongst other synoptic condition for the tehuantepecer is associated with high-pressure  system forming in sierra madre of mexico in the wake of an advancing cold front  which causes winds to accelerate through the isthmus of tehuantepec  tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts  between october and february  with a summer maximum in july caused by the westward extension of the azores high  wind magnitude is greater during el niño years than during la niña years  due to the more frequent cold frontal incursions during el niño its effects can last from a few hours to six el niño s warm pool feeds thunderstorms above  it creates increased rainfall across the east-central  and eastern pacific ocean  including several portions of the south american west coast  the effects of el niño in south america are direct and stronger than in north america  an el niño is associated with warm and very wet weather months in april–october along the coasts of northern peru and ecuador  causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or the effects during the months of february  march  and april may become critical  along the west coast of south america  el niño reduces the upwelling of cold  nutrient-rich  water that sustains large fish populations  which in turn sustain abundant sea birds  whose droppings support the fertilizer industry  the reduction in upwelling leads to fish kills off the shore of local fishing industry along the affected coastline can suffer during long-lasting  el niño events  the world s largest fishery collapsed due to overfishing during the 1972  el niño peruvian anchoveta reduction  during the 1982–83  event  jack mackerel and anchoveta populations were reduced  scallops increased in warmer water  but hake followed cooler water down the continental slope  while shrimp and sardines moved southward  so some catches decreased while others horse mackerel have increased in the region during warm events  shifting locations and types of fish due to changing conditions provide challenges for fishing industries  peruvian sardines have moved during el niño events to chilean areas  other conditions provide further complications  such as the government of chile in 1991  creating restrictions on the fishing areas for self-employed  fishermen and industrial needed the enso variability may contribute to the great success of small  fast-growing  species along the peruvian coast  as periods of low population removes predators in the area  similar effects benefit migratory birds that travel each spring from predator-rich  tropical areas to distant winter-stressed  nesting needed southern brazil and northern argentina also experience wetter than normal conditions  but mainly during the spring and early summer  central chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall  and the peruvian-bolivian  altiplano is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events  drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the amazon river basin  colombia  and central needed when el niño conditions last for many months  extensive ocean warming and the reduction in easterly trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient-rich  deep water  and its economic effect on local fishing for an international market can be generally  el niño can affect commodity prices and the macroeconomy of different countries  it can constrain the supply of rain-driven  agricultural commodities  reduce agricultural output  construction  and services activities  create food-price  and generalised inflation  and may trigger social unrest in commodity-dependent  poor countries that primarily rely on imported a university of cambridge working paper shows that while australia  chile  indonesia  india  japan  new zealand and south africa face a short-lived  fall in economic activity in response to an el niño shock  other countries may actually benefit from an el niño weather shock  either directly or indirectly through positive spillovers from major trading partners   for instance  argentina  canada  mexico and the united states  furthermore  most countries experience short-run  inflationary pressures following an el niño shock  while global energy and non-fuel  commodity prices the imf estimates a significant el niño can boost the gdp of the united states by about 0.5%   due largely to lower heating bills  and reduce the gdp of indonesia by about weather conditions related to the el niño cycle correlate with changes in the incidence of epidemic diseases  for example  the el niño cycle is associated with increased risks of some of the diseases transmitted by mosquitoes  such as malaria  dengue  and rift valley cycles of malaria in india  venezuela  brazil  and colombia have now been linked to el niño  outbreaks of another mosquito-transmitted  disease  australian encephalitis  murray valley encephalitis—mve   occur in temperate south-east  australia after heavy rainfall and flooding  which are associated with la niña events  a severe outbreak of rift valley fever occurred after extreme rainfall in north-eastern  kenya and southern somalia during the 1997–98  el conditions have also been related to kawasaki disease incidence in japan and the west coast of the united via the linkage to tropospheric winds across the north pacific may be linked to civil conflicts  scientists at the earth institute of columbia university  having analyzed data from 1950  to 2004,  suggest enso may have had a role in 21%  of all civil conflicts since 1950,  with the risk of annual civil conflict doubling from 3%  to 6%  in countries affected by enso during el niño years relative to la niña
