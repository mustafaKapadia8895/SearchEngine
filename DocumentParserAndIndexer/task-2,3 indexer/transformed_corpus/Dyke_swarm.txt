 a dike swarm or dyke swarm is a large geological structure consisting of a major group of parallel  linear  or radially oriented dikes intruded within continental crust  they consist of several to hundreds of dikes emplaced more or less contemporaneously during a single intrusive event  and are magmatic and stratigraphic  such dike swarms may form a large igneous province and are the roots of a volcanic province the occurrence of mafic dike swarms in archean and paleoproterozoic terrains is often cited as evidence for mantle plume activity associated with abnormally high mantle potential temperatures dike swarms may extend over 400  km (250  mi  in width and length  the largest dike swarm known on earth is the mackenzie dike swarm in the western half of the canadian shield in canada  which is more than 500  km (310  mi  wide and 3,000  km (1,900  mi  number of known giant dike swarms on earth is small  only about 25.  however  the primary geometry of most giant dike swarms is poorly known due to their age and subsequent tectonic activity dike swarms have also been found on venus and
