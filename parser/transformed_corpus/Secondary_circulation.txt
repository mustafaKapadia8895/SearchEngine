a secondary circulation is a circulation induced in a rotating system. for example, the primary circulation of earth's atmosphere is zonal. if however a parcel of air, that moves in a purely zonal direction, is accelerated or decelerated zonally, the coriolis force will add a meridional component to its velocity. this meridional circulation is then the secondary circulation.
