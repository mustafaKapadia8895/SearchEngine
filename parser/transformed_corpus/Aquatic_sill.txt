an aquatic sill (or an oceanic sill) is a sea floor (or lake floor) barrier of relatively shallow depth restricting water movement between oceanic basins.[1]an aquatic sill can be a biogeographic barrier for species located in deep basins on either side. on top of an aquatic sill, water is often warmer than deeper water.[1]an aquatic sill can restrict movement of water masses in the bottom, and also results in their isolation, which can be partial, and is sometimes near total.[2]
