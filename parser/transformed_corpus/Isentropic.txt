in thermodynamics, an isentropic process is an idealized thermodynamic process that is both adiabatic and reversible.[1][2][3][4][5][6] the work transfers of the system are frictionless, and there is no transfer of heat or matter. such an idealized process is useful in engineering as a model of and basis of comparison for real processes.[7]the word 'isentropic' is occasionally, though not customarily, interpreted in another way, reading it as if its meaning were deducible from its etymology. this is contrary to its original and customarily used definition. in this occasional reading, it means a process in which the entropy of the system remains unchanged, for example because work done on the system includes friction internal to the system, and heat is withdrawn from the system, in just the right amount to compensate for the internal friction, so as to leave the entropy unchanged.[8]the second law of thermodynamics states that,where
δ
q
{\displaystyle \delta q}
is the amount of energy the system gains by heating,
t
{\displaystyle t}
is the temperature of the system, and
d
s
{\displaystyle ds}
is the change in entropy. the equal sign refers to a reversible process, which is an imagined idealized theoretical limit, never actually occurring in physical reality.[9][10] for an isentropic process, which by definition is reversible, there is no transfer of energy as heat because the process is adiabatic. in an irreversible process of transfer of energy as work, entropy is produced within the system; consequently, in order to maintain constant entropy within the system, energy must be removed from the system as heat during the process.for reversible processes, an isentropic transformation is carried out by thermally "insulating" the system from its surroundings. temperature is the thermodynamic conjugate variable to entropy, thus the conjugate process would be an isothermal process in which the system is thermally "connected" to a constant-temperature heat bath.the entropy of a given mass does not change during a process that is internally reversible and adiabatic. a process during which the entropy remains constant is called an isentropic process, written

. [11] some examples of theoretically isentropic thermodynamic devices are pumps, gas compressors, turbines, nozzles, and diffusers.most steady-flow devices operate under adiabatic conditions, and the ideal process for these devices is the isentropic process.the parameter that describes how efficiently a device approximates a corresponding isentropic device is called isentropic or adiabatic efficiency.[12]isentropic efficiency of turbines:isentropic efficiency of compressorsisentropic efficiency of nozzlesfor all the above equations:ideal rankine cycle 1->2 isentropic compression in a pump

note: the isentropic assumptions are only applicable with ideal cycles. real cycles have inherent losses due to compressor and turbine inefficiencies and the second law of thermodynamics. real systems are not truly isentropic, but isentropic behavior is an adequate approximation for many calculation purposes.in fluid dynamics, an isentropic flow is a fluid flow that is both adiabatic and reversible. that is, no heat is added to the flow, and no energy transformations occur due to friction or dissipative effects. for an isentropic flow of a perfect gas, several relations can be derived to define the pressure, density and temperature along a streamline.note that energy can be exchanged with the flow in an isentropic transformation, as long as it doesn't happen as heat exchange. an example of such an exchange would be an isentropic expansion or compression that entails work done on or by the flow.for an isentropic flow, entropy density can vary between different streamlines. if the entropy density is the same everywhere, then the flow is said to be homentropic.for a closed system, the total change in energy of a system is the sum of the work done and the heat added,the reversible work done on a system by changing the volume is,where
p
{\displaystyle p}

v
{\displaystyle v}

. all reversible adiabatic processes are isentropic. this leads to two important observations,next, a great deal can be computed for isentropic processes of an ideal gas. for any transformation of an ideal gas, it is always true thatusing the general results derived above for
