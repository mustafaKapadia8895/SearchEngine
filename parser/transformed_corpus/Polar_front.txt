in meteorology, the polar front is the boundary between the polar cell and the ferrel cell around the 60Â° latitude in each hemisphere. at this boundary a sharp gradient in temperature occurs between these two air masses, each at very different temperatures.the polar front arises as a result of cold polar air meeting warm tropical air. it is a stationary front as the air masses are not moving against each other. off the coast of eastern north america, especially in winter, there is a sharp temperature gradient between the snow-covered land and the warm offshore currents.the polar front theory says that mid-latitude cyclones form on boundaries between warm and cold air. in winter, the polar front shifts towards the equator, whereas high pressure systems dominate more in the summer.
