coordinates: 39°26′n 29°50′w﻿ / ﻿39.44°n 29.83°w﻿ / 39.44; -29.83 the azores triple junction (atj) is a geologic triple junction where the boundaries of three tectonic plates intersect: the north american plate, the eurasian plate and the african plate. this triple junction is located along the mid-atlantic ridge (mar) amidst the azores islands, nearly due west of the straits of gibraltar. it is classed as a r-r-r triple junction, t type (for its shape), as it is an intersection of the mid-atlantic ridge running north-south and the terceira rift which runs east-southeast.the spreading rate along the mar does not change abruptly at the atj, instead decreasing from 22.9±0.1 mm/yr at 40°n to 19.8±0.2 mm/yr at 38°n. this means the atj is not a simple triple junction where three tectonic plates meet at a point. the transitional range of spreading rates instead indicates the presence of a microplate, commonly referred to as the azores microplate. its northern boundary intersects the mar between 39.4°n and 40.0°n and its southern between 38.2°n and 38.5°n. the microplate moves about 2 mm/yr east-northeast along its nubian boundary.[1]
