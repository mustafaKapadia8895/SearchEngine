(compare this with i brushed my clothes after i fed the cat.) a relative clause takes commas if it is non-restrictive, as in i cut down all the trees, which were over six feet tall. (without the comma, this would mean that only those trees over six feet tall were cut down.)some style guides prescribe that two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) must be separated by a comma placed before the conjunction.[8][9] in the following sentences, where the second clause is independent (because it can stand alone as a sentence), the comma is considered by those guides to be necessary:in the following sentences, where the second half of the sentence is not an independent clause (because it does not contain an explicit subject), those guides prescribe that the comma be omitted:however, such guides permit the comma to be omitted if the second independent clause is very short, typically when the second independent clause is an imperative,[8][9] as in:the above guidance is not universally accepted or applied. long coordinating clauses are nonetheless usually separated by commas:[10]in some languages, such as german and polish, stricter rules apply on comma usage between clauses, with dependent clauses always being set off with commas, and commas being generally proscribed before certain coordinating conjunctions.the joining of two independent sentences with a comma and no conjunction (as in "it is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark.") is known as a comma splice and is sometimes considered an error in english;[11] in most cases a semicolon should be used instead. a comma splice should not be confused, though, with asyndeton, a literary device used for a specific effect in which coordinating conjunctions are purposely omitted.commas are always used to set off certain adverbs at the beginning of a sentence, including however, in fact, therefore, nevertheless, moreover, furthermore, and still.if these adverbs appear in the middle of a sentence, they are followed and preceded by a comma. as in the second of the two below examples, if the two sentences are separated by a semicolon and the second sentence starts with an adverb, then it is preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma.using commas to offset certain adverbs is optional, including then, so, yet, instead, and too (meaning also). commas are often used to enclose parenthetical words and phrases within a sentence (i.e., information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence). such phrases are both preceded and followed by a comma, unless that would result in a doubling of punctuation marks, or the parenthetical is at the start or end of the sentence. the following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases:a comma is used to separate coordinate adjectives (i.e., adjectives that directly and equally modify the following noun). adjectives are considered coordinate if the meaning would be the same if their order were reversed or if and were placed between them. for example:some writers precede quoted material that is the grammatical object of an active verb of speaking or writing with a comma, as in mr. kershner says, "you should know how to use a comma." quotations that follow and support an assertion are often preceded by a colon rather than a comma.other writers do not put a comma before quotations unless one would occur anyway. thus they would write mr. kershner says "you should know how to use a comma."when a date is written as a month followed by a day followed by a year, a comma separates the day from the year: december 19, 1941. this style is common in american english. the comma is used to avoid confusing consecutive numbers: december 19 1941. most style manuals, including the chicago manual of style[13] and the ap stylebook,[14] also recommend that the year be treated as a parenthetical, requiring a second comma after it: "feb. 14, 1987, was the target date."if just month and year are given, no commas are used:[15] "her daughter april may return in june 2009 for the reunion."when the day precedes the month, the month name separates the numeric day and year, so commas are not necessary to separate them: "the raid on alexandria was carried out on 19 december 1941."commas are used to separate parts of geographical references, such as city and state (dallas, texas) or city and country (kampala, uganda). additionally, most style manuals, including the chicago manual of style[16] and the ap stylebook,[17] recommend that the second element be treated as a parenthetical, requiring a second comma after: "the plane landed in kampala, uganda, that evening."[18]the united states postal service[19] and royal mail[20] recommend leaving out punctuation when writing addresses on actual letters and packages, as the marks hinder optical character recognition.in representing large numbers, from the right side to the left, english texts usually use commas to separate each group of three digits in front of the decimal. this is almost always done for numbers of six or more digits and often for five or four digits but not in front of the number itself. however, in much of europe, southern africa and latin america, periods or spaces are used instead; the comma is used as a decimal separator, equivalent to the use in english of the decimal point. in india, the groups are two digits, except for the rightmost group. however the comma may not be used for this purpose at all in some styles, e.g. the si writing style;[21] a space may be used to separate groups of three digits instead.commas are used when writing names that are presented surname first, generally in instances of alphabetization by surname: smith, john. they are also used before many titles that follow a name: john smith, ph.d.similarly in lists that are presented with an inversion: ...; socks, green: 3 pairs; socks, red: 2 pairs; tie, regimental: 1.commas may be used to indicate that a word, or a group of words, has been omitted,[23] as in the cat was white; the dog, brown. (here the comma replaces was.)commas are placed before, after, or around a noun or pronoun used independently in speaking to some person, place or thing:in his 1785 essay on punctuation, joseph robertson advocated a comma between the subject and predicate of long sentences for clarity; however, this usage is regarded as an error in modern times.the comma and the quotation mark pairing can be used in several ways. in american english, the comma is commonly included inside a quotation mark:[24][25]in great britain and many other parts of the world, punctuation is usually placed within quotation marks only if it is part of what is being quoted or referred to:[24][25][26]there is also some difference regarding the use of the serial comma, which is an optional comma placed before the coordinating conjunction in a list of three or more items:the serial comma is also known as the oxford comma, harvard comma, or series comma. it is sometimes perceived as overly careful or an americanism[citation needed], but its usage occurs within both american and british english. it is called the oxford comma because of its long history of use by oxford university press.[27]opinions among writers and editors differ on whether to use the serial comma. a majority of american style guides mandate use of the serial comma, including the chicago manual of style, strunk and white's the elements of style, and the u.s. government printing office style manual. the ap stylebook for journalistic writing advises against it. it is used less often in british english, but some british style guides require it, including the oxford university press style manual and fowler's modern english usage. some writers of british english use it only where necessary to avoid ambiguity.according to new hart's rules, "house style will dictate" whether to use the serial comma, and "the general rule is that one style or the other should be used consistently." no association with region or dialect is suggested, other than that its use has been strongly advocated by oxford university press.[28]barbara child advises that "it is a good idea to put a comma before the last item in a series", but claims that in the united states there is a trend toward a decreased use of the comma generally.[29] this is reinforced by an article by robert j. samuelson in newsweek.[30] lynne truss says that general decline in usage of commas is equally true in the uk, where it has been a slow, steady trend for at least a century:nowadays ... a passage peppered with commas—which in the past would have indicated painstaking and authoritative editorial attention—smacks simply of no backbone. people who put in all the commas betray themselves as moral weaklings with empty lives and out-of-date reference books. (truss, 2004, pp. 97–98)in his 1963 book of spies and stratagems, stanley p. lovell recalls that, during the second world war, the british carried the comma over into abbreviations. specifically, "special operations, executive" was written "s.o.,e.". nowadays, even the full stops are frequently discarded.punctuation has been added to many languages which originally developed without it, including a number of different comma forms. european languages like german, french, italian, spanish, and portuguese use the same comma as english with similar spacing, though usage may be somewhat different. for instance, in standard german, subordinate clauses are always preceded by commas. modern greek uses the same unicode comma for its kómma (κόμμα)[31] and it is officially romanized as a latin comma,[32] but it has additional roles owing to its conflation with the former hypodiastole, a curved interpunct used to disambiguate certain homonyms. the comma therefore functions as a silent letter in a handful of greek words, principally distinguishing ό,τι (ó,ti, "whatever") from ότι (óti, "that").[31]the enumeration or ideographic comma—u+3001 、 ideographic comma—is used in chinese, japanese punctuation, and somewhat in korean punctuation. in the people's republic of china and in north/south korea, this comma (t 頓號, s 顿号, p dùnhào) is usually used only to separate items in lists, while in japan it is the more common form of comma (読点, r tōten, lit. "reading mark"). in documents that mix japanese and latin scripts, the full-width comma (u+ff0c ， fullwidth comma) is used; this is the standard form of comma (t 逗號, s 逗号, p dòuhào) in china. since east asian typography permits commas to join clauses dealing with certain topics or lines of thought, commas may separate subjects and predicates and constructions that would be considered a "comma splice" in english are acceptable and commonly encountered.korean punctuation uses both commas and interpuncts for lists.the comma in the arabic script (used by arabic, urdu, and persian, etc.) is inverted, upside-down: '،' (u+060c ، arabic comma), in order to distinguish it from the arabic diacritic ḍammah (ُ ), representing the vowel /u/, which is similarly comma-shaped.[33] in arabic texts, western-styled comma (٫) is used as a decimal point.reversed comma (u+2e41 ⹁ reversed comma) is used in sindhi when written in arabic script. it is different from the standard arabic comma.hebrew script is also written from right to left. however, hebrew punctuation includes only a regular comma (,).dravidian languages such as tamil, telugu, kannada, and malayalam also use the punctuation mark in similar usage to that of european languages with similar spacing.[34]in the common character encoding systems unicode and ascii, character 44 (0x2c) corresponds to the comma symbol. the html numeric character reference is &#44;.in many computer languages commas are used as a field delimiter to separate arguments to a function, to separate elements in a list, and to perform data designation on multiple variables at once.in the c programming language the comma symbol is an operator which evaluates its first argument (which may have side-effects) and then returns the value of its evaluated second argument. this is useful in for statements and macros.in smalltalk, the comma operator is used to concatenate collections, including strings.in prolog, the comma is used to denote logical conjunction ("and").the comma-separated values (csv) format is very commonly used in exchanging text data between database and spreadsheet formats.the comma is used as a diacritic mark in romanian under the s (ș, ș), and under the t (ț, ț). a cedilla is occasionally used instead of it (notably in the unicode glyph names), but this is technically incorrect. the symbol d̦ (d with comma below) was used as part of the romanian transitional alphabet (19th century) to indicate the sounds denoted by the latin letter z or letters dz, where derived from a cyrillic ѕ (/dz/). the comma and the cedilla are both derivative of a small cursive z (ʒ) placed below the letter. from this standpoint alone, ș, ț, and d̦ could potentially be regarded as stand-ins for sz, tz, and dz respectively.in latvian, the comma is used on the letters ģ, ķ, ļ, ņ, and historically also ŗ, to indicate palatalization. because the lowercase letter g has a descender, the comma is rotated 180° and placed over the letter. although their adobe glyph names are commas, their names in the unicode standard are g, k, l, n, and r with a cedilla. they were introduced to the unicode standard before 1992, and their name cannot be altered.in czech and slovak, the diacritic in the characters ď, ť, and ľ resembles a superscript comma, but it is used instead of a caron because the letter has an ascender. other ascender letters with carons, such as letters ȟ (used in finnish romani and lakota) and ǩ (used in skolt sami), did not modify their carons to superscript commas.in 16th-century guatemala, the archaic letter cuatrillo with a comma (ꜯ, ꜯ) was used to write mayan languages.[35]digits with commas (🄁 🄂 🄃 🄄 🄅 🄆 🄇 🄈 🄉 🄊) are in the enclosed alphanumeric supplement unicode block.
